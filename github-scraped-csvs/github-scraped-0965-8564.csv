"The who, why, and when of Uber and other ride-hailing trips: An examination of a large sample household travel survey",10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.018,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Convenience and low prices have enabled ride-hailing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, to position themselves amongst the most valuable companies within the transportation sector. They now account for the lion share of activities in the platform economy and play an increasing role within our cities. Despite this, very little is known about the type of people that use them, nor the purpose and timing of trips. In addition to this, their effect on other modes, such as taxis and public transit, remains, for the most part, widely unexplored. By comparing the socioeconomic and trip characteristics of ride-hailing users to that of other mode users, we find ride-hailing to be a wealthy younger generation phenomenon. While our results show that ride-hailing is too minute and inconsequential to influence the ridership level of other more substantial modes of travel overall, when considering specific market segments, the rise of ride-hailing corresponds to a significant decrease in taxi ridership and a rise in active modes of travel. Moreover, due to the specific age, timing, and purpose of our subsample, we believe that ride-hailing may effectively reduce drunk-driving, and are convinced that as this mode increases in importance in the future, it will have a much more pronounced effect on the level of ridership of other modes as well.",0965-8564,Not found
Decomposition and attribution analysis of the transport sector's carbon dioxide intensity change in China,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.001,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Understanding the factors driving changes in transport carbon dioxide (CO2) intensity and the contributions of different regions to each factor helps inform targeted emissions reduction policies. This paper provides a comprehensive approach, combining index decomposition analysis (IDA), production-theoretical decomposition analysis (PDA) and attribution analysis (AA), to decompose the changes in transport CO2 intensity into nine factors and identify the contributions of different regions to the individual factors. Energy-related and transport-related factors are considered simultaneously and some new factors are created to provide additional insights for exploring changes in transport CO2 intensity. An empirical study of the transport sector across 30 Chinese PARs (provincial administrative regions) resulted in three key findings. First, the effect of potential transport energy intensity and the effect of the economic output technology were the major drivers for the reduction in transport CO2 intensity, while the effect of potential transport intensity and the effect of energy utilization technology were the major factors that increased the transport CO2 intensity. Second, due to the diverse transport sector characteristics of the 30 PARs, their contributions to the four driving factors for the transport CO2 intensity mitigation varied. Third, specific policy implications in terms of energy conservation and transport management policy were proposed for the 30 PARs.",0965-8564,Not found
On the impact of vehicle automation on the value of travel time while performing work and leisure activities in a car: Theoretical insights and results from a stated preference survey,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.016,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Many experts believe the transport system is about to change dramatically. This change is due to so-called fully-automated vehicles (AVs). However, at present, there are numerous important knowledge gaps that need to be solved for the successful integration of AVs in our transport systems, in particular regarding the impacts of AVs on travel demand. For instance, full automation will enable passengers to perform other, non-driving, related tasks while traveling to their destination. This may substantially change the way in which passengers experience traveling by car, and, in turn, may lead to considerable changes in the so-called Value of Travel Time (VOTT). Many experts anticipate the VOTT to decrease substantially due to AVs. However, the extent to which VOTT will change is currently far from clear. This study aims to develop new insights on the potential impacts of fully automated vehicles on the VOTT for commute trips. To do so, we first look at the existing microeconomics theory on the perceived VOTT and analyze the expected changes accrued from the effect of working and having leisure in an AV. We conclude that the VOTT of a work vehicle should be lower than what is experienced today in a conventional vehicle but the leisure one could stay the same. Then we conduct a stated choice experiment, specifically designed and administered for measuring the VOTT, and analyze these data using discrete choice models (DCMs). In total, we collected data from about 500 respondents. In the experiment, respondents were presented choice tasks consisting of three alternatives: an AV with office interior, an AV with leisure interior, and a conventional car. The same experiment was also given to another sample of respondents but this time describing a chauffeur-driven vehicle. Overall we find the average VOTT for an AV with an office interior (5.50€/h) to be lower than the VOTT for the conventional car (7.47€/h), however the AV with leisure interior is not found to decrease the value of time (8.17€/h) which confirms the theoretical results. The VOTT for the chauffeur experiment is systematically lower than for the AV experiment which we attribute to some distrust that people have regarding the AVs.",0965-8564,Not found
The causality of road traffic fatalities with its determinants in upper middle income countries: A continent-wide comparison,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.002,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This study aims to compare the causality and elasticity of road traffic fatalities (RTF) with their determinants for upper middle income countries from three continents by using annual data from 1994 to 2016. Vector Error Correction Model revealed the long run causality of RTF (Asia, Europe, America), GDP (Asia), rainfall (Europe), and population density (Europe, America). Two-way short-run causality was established in three panels of UMICs between RTF and rainfall (Asia), RTF and GDP (Europe, America), and RTF and population density (America). Short-run uni-directional causal association was also observed from RTF to GDP (Asia), RTF to rainfall (Europe, America), RTF to population density (Asia, Europe), and health expenditures to RTF (Europe). A significant fall in RTF was observed due to 1% rise in the share of health expenditures in GDP in UMICs from Asia (0.267%), Europe (0.064%), and America (0.549%). The significant rise in RTF was0.180%, 0.241%, and 0.702%due to 1%increase in per capita GDP in Asia, Europe, and America. The road safety is reduced due to rainfall because the rise in RTF was 0.082%and 0.260%for 1% rise in the rainfall in Asia and America, respectively. The impact of population density was beneficial for the road safety because the decrease in RTF was 0.246%, 0.234%, and 0.977% for 1% rise in the population density in Asia, Europe, and America. The governments should make strict policies for traffic laws implementation. The government should allocate more budget for health sector expenditures. The governments should include traffic education as part of syllabus from primary to higher studies. Government should create awareness about the loss due to road crashes.",0965-8564,Not found
Identifying passengers’ needs in cabin interiors of high-speed rails in China using quality function deployment for improving passenger satisfaction,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.004,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This study aims to propose a methodology for understanding the needs of passengers of the second-class cabins of high-speed rails (HSRs) in China. Addressing these needs is important to improve service quality and passenger satisfaction. We initially utilize the most important and also the first step of quality function deployment (QFD) to collect and organize data. Multiple methods, including scene deployment/gemba, social media analysis, and critical incident approach, are used to collect the voice of the customer (VOC). With aid of the VOC table (VOCT), the collected VOC is interpreted from passengers’ perspective and deployed as need items, which are grouped into passenger needs using the technique of affinity diagramming. To determine which of the passenger needs are important, we present the need items in a questionnaire in the form of pairwise comparison to obtain the opinion of frequent passengers. The collected responses are processed with the interval-valued analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to obtain the relative importance of the needs. Comfortable seat, sensory comfort, and proper luggage storage are identified as the major concerns of passengers. The obtained results should serve as valuable reference for planning and improving the design of cabin interiors and the quality of passenger service of HSRs in China. The study also provides a method for understanding customers’ needs related to the infrastructure and facilities of rails and those of other modes of public transportation.",0965-8564,Not found
Socio-structural and psychological factors behind car use: Comparing Northern and Eastern Europe,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.007,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This study explores cross-cultural differences in car travel behaviour in a northern and an eastern European country, namely Sweden and Estonia. We assess the role of country-specific socio-structural circumstances, and the influence of individual motivations, including social values, perceived seriousness of environmental problems associated with car use, and car use reduction intentions, in shaping the frequency of car use for different purposes. The results show that compared to Swedish people, people in Estonia are more dependent on cars in their everyday travel. Our study shows that higher social position is associated with higher frequency of car trips in more stratified Estonian society, but not necessarily where socio-economic differences are less pronounced, as in Sweden. Regarding the relative significance of values and intentions next to socio-economic determinants, values and intentions have a greater explanatory power of car use frequency in Estonia, compared to Sweden. That values and preferences play a smaller role in car travel frequency in the socio-economically more secure Sweden, indicates that car travel is a basic habit, which is not easily discernible through individual values and attitudes in more affluent societies. Differences in car travel frequencies between the respondents from different settlement types in Estonian but no differences between settlement types in Sweden, shows that a country’s broader approach to managing the economic and social viability of its regions, may shape car travel needs and opportunities. The results of this study may have implications in terms of ways of curbing emissions from transportation in different parts of Europe.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of including service quality into efficiency analysis: The case of franchising regional rail passenger serves in Germany,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.019,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Based on a 12 years panel data set for franchised regional rail services, this paper studies the impact of including service quality into an analysis of efficiency differences between the German public transport authorities (PTAs) in using their available public funds. The analysis employs a two-stage efficiency analysis with a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in the first stage and a Tobit panel model in the second stage. Both a base model with conventional output variables and a model which includes additional indicators of service quality provide robust results regarding the factors which explain efficiency differences between PTAs. PTAs with a higher share of tendering, a higher share of gross contracts and longer and smaller contracts were more efficient than others, with the effect being even stronger when including quality of service indicators. A further finding is the change of PTA’s ranking when including quality of service. Therefore, neglecting quality of service and restricting efficiency analysis to conventional output measures might result in misleading policies.",0965-8564,Not found
Measuring the value for money of transport infrastructure procurement; an intergenerational approach,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.013,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Cost-benefit analysis is essential for decision-making in connection with major transport projects and integrated investment programmes. Projects of transport infrastructure have traditionally been publicly promoted and managed, but funded through both public and private sources. While budget allocations are always somehow present, the financing of the project may involve private participation, including user fees and loans of various types. Actually, management models involving private actors have been increasingly used in recent decades. The background supporting this trend is that private ingenuity and expertise in dealing with risk improves overall project efficiency enough to compensate for the additional expenditure generated by these models. In addition, the government promoting the investment may use private finance as a mechanism to place it off-budget. Current methods of project appraisal, in particular cost-benefit analysis, look at actions from the point of view of today’s society. Decision makers usually determine the financing formula after the decision to build has been adopted, which should ideally follow a positive conclusion on the efficiency of the project. But the financing formula has an impact across the successive generations of users and/or taxpayers that will end up footing the bill stemming from the investment. This paper actually highlights the importance of looking closely at the intergenerational effects of the adopted financing mechanism to ensure its fairness and convenience. It describes the outcomes obtained from the analysis of the intergenerational impacts performed with IREM –a model developed precisely to analyse these effects – to a set of urban public transport infrastructure projects. The IREM results show that public-private partnerships, although often entailing a substantial increase of the public expenditure linked to these projects compared to conventional procurement mechanisms, are typically better in terms of intergenerational fairness. This conclusion cannot be extended to all PPPs, as it depends on the alternative public sector funding, but it is a strong argument in favour of including in the Value for Money analysis of PPPs, besides the standard efficiency and financial considerations, an analysis of the intergenerational effects of the different procurement options and to compare these effects with those of the purely public financing alternative.",0965-8564,Not found
An incentive mechanism design for bus subsidy based on the route service level,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.006,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The use of public transit subsidy has become a widely discussed aspect for the development of public transportation. The government uses the subsidy policy to offer incentives to improve the service levels and convenience of residents. This paper presents an incentive subsidy mechanism which is based on the service level of a bus line. The subsidy mechanism overcomes the problem of information asymmetry between public transport companies and the local government in the subsidy process, and thus reinforces that bus companies should provide efficient services on lines of different profitability levels. This paper provides the analytical results of the model and analyzes the optimal results. To broaden the scope of application of this model, this study also provides an example that explains how to regulate the bus company when quality reduction happened if the subsidy occurs at the beginning of the subsidy period. At last, management significance and policy recommendations are offered and possible directions for further research are explored.",0965-8564,Not found
Wage and tax competitiveness: The case of Hellenic shipping,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.011,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Shipping and related activities account for a considerable proportion of Greek GDP, rendering proceeds from shipping sector activities indispensable for the Greek economy, especially during the ongoing economic crisis. This study focuses on the mitigating impact of wage regulation and tax uncertainty in Greece upon net receipts from shipping. Using quarterly data for 2002–2017 and employing the General Method of Moments, we find a substantially negative effect on net receipts from shipping as a result of waning wage competitiveness, with the tonnage tax-rate increase aggravating the problem. Our results point to two major policy conclusions: First, excessive wage increases over and above those provided for in international agreements erode the competitiveness of Greek shipping. Second, the pioneering tonnage-based taxation framework of Greece, which has contributed to securing Hellenic shipping a roughly 50% market share in the EU and 16.7% in the world, should by no means be challenged. Given the ease of relocation and the antagonistic fiscal incentives provided in rival shipping centers, the tonnage tax system must be left intact and even be used as a model to help boost the competitiveness of the entire EU fleet.",0965-8564,Not found
Modelling intermodal travel in Switzerland: A recursive logit approach,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.009,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"We use data from the Swiss national household travel survey to 1. analyze the socioeconomic determinants for intermodal travel in Switzerland and 2. estimate a first large-scale multimodal recursive logit route choice model for urban trip making. We show that intermodal travel is mostly associated with ownership of transit subscriptions, which allow free at the point-of-use public transportation. We also present a framework using open-source data to generate the multimodal network for the recursive logit model estimation. The fact that the model only needs a multimodal network to model the transport supply makes it independent of path sampling algorithms for the choice-set construction and it thus provides an alternative to classic mode and route choice models, since it can estimate mode and route choice parameters with directly observed routes, removing the sampling bias. By eliminating the need to sample alternative paths for estimation, it also simplifies the estimation process, making it a viable choice as an integral solution for joint route and mode choice modelling.",0965-8564,Not found
Does cargo matter? The impact of air cargo operations on departure on-time performance for combination carriers,10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.005,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Airline business models are under constant development. Combination carriers generate revenues from passenger and cargo operations jointly. This study makes use of an econometric model to investigate how air cargo operations impact on the quality of service perceived by passengers. Building on empirical data from the U.S., it indicates that air cargo operations increase departure delays. Hence, passenger and cargo business are tied together in terms of revenue as well as operational complexity. To address this trade-off, airline business models must be considered within the entire continuum of passenger and cargo operations.",0965-8564,Not found
A four-step method for electric-vehicle charging facility deployment in a dense city: An empirical study in Singapore,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.012,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"In the recent decade, electric vehicles (EVs), as a clean and cost-effective transport means, are paving the way to replace conventional gasoline vehicles. To facilitate wider adoption of EVs, corresponding charging infrastructures have to be established first. In this paper, we propose a four-step method to deploy normal and fast charging stations that can satisfy the charging demand of private EVs, 1-shift and 2-shift EV taxis in a mature city. The proposed four-step method provides an easy-to-implement procedure for charging demand estimation and distribution. First, we derive the charging frequency and type of charging facilities for each type of EVs based on their technical specifications and operational characteristics. Then, total demand for normal and fast charging facilities can be generated by using up-to-date transport statistics, and these demand is allocated to various charging sites (car parks or petrol stations) based on spatial distribution of EVs. Given the average daily engaged working hours of a charger, service capacity at each charging station is thus determined. A case study of Singapore is put forward in the end and a scenario analysis is conducted to demonstrate the impact of driving range.",0965-8564,Not found
The evolutionary interaction between taxi-sharing behaviours and social networks,10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.043,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Mobility services increasingly consider the sharing of vehicles to reduce resource use and congestion. People are, however, reluctant to sharing vehicles with strangers. Therefore, this paper investigates the dynamic co-evolution of taxi-sharing behaviours and the taxi-sharing-oriented social network structure. A social network based taxi-sharing method is introduced that is able to prioritise taxi-sharing with acquaintances over strangers while capping the detour cost to reasonable and varied limits. Furthermore, the social network structure evolves and is updated based on shared trips. An empirical simulation demonstrates the advantages of social network based taxi-sharing, i.e., an increased match rate and a comparable satisfaction level to trip-based methods. The spatial aggregation of the emerging social network not only suggests a space-time searching heuristic for taxi-sharing, but also indicates how social factors conquer space while space constrains social interactions.",0965-8564,Not found

Is promoting public transit an effective intervention for obesity?: A longitudinal study of the relation between public transit usage and obesity,10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.027,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"There is increasing evidence on the association between public transit usage and obesity. To further understand the causal impact of changes in county public transit usage on county obesity rates, this paper presents a longitudinal study on this topic. Annual health data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and transportation data from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) were aggregated and matched at the county level, to create a panel data set with 227 counties from 45 states across two time periods, 2001 and 2009. Annual public transit funding, obtained from the National Transit Database (NTD), is chosen as an instrumental variable to simulate changes in public transit usage caused by exogenous changes in public policies. Possible confounding variables such as amount of leisure time physical activity, health care coverage and distribution of income are explicitly controlled. All time-invariant county level heterogeneities are implicitly controlled using first difference estimators. This study shows that promoting public transit in a county can effectively decrease the county obesity rate. Specifically, a one percentage point increase of frequent public transit riders in a county population is estimated to decrease the county population obesity rate by 0.473 % points. This result supports findings in previous research that the extra amount of physical activity involved in public transit usage can have a statistically significant impact on obesity. In addition, this study also provides empirical evidence for the effectiveness of encouraging public transit usage as a public health intervention for obesity.",0965-8564,Not found
To be or not to be dockless: Empirical analysis of dockless bikeshare development in China,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.007,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This paper discusses the development of shared bike programs in China, especially the innovative dockless bikeshare (DBS) system, using up-to-date empirical analysis. Bicycle sharing programs had existed in China since 2008 but overall bicycle mode share decreased until 2016 when DBS emerged. A comparison of classical city docked bikeshare (BS) programs found that government-oriented operators and a low financial threshold for users were the keys to the success of docked BS in China. In less than two years, a new, innovative, flexible, shared bicycling system – the DBS – has grown from nothing to a substantial 23 million fleets, covering over 200 cities and regions, making docked BS appear insignificant. It is a highly capital-driven, privately-operated business model, largely deployed in cities in conjunction with urban railway systems and has achieved high penetration in mega cites (e.g., 0.135 fleet/resident in Beijing). The development of DBS has experienced “free growth”, “regulated” and “limited” phases in a short time. While the central government initially held a “neutral-positive” policy towards this new system, the rapid expansion of dockless fleets soon exceeded cities’ limits and resulted in local government policies changing from “neutral-positive” to “neutral-negative”, and from August 2017, forceful limiting regulations have been implemented. DBS systems have advantages such as easy access using a smart phone, convenience of pickup and park and low cost. These merits attract its main users, who are found to be young, highly educated with almost equal numbers of males and females. DBS trips are mainly short, with high frequency and used for commuting purposes. DBS systems have burgeoned due to three factors: (1) those promoting user demands, (2) those winning partial support of government, and (3) those promoting operators’ supply. The results show that rapid growth of dockless bikeshare programs is mainly “supply-driven by operators” rather than by “user demand” or “triggered by government policy”. Financial sustainability, vandalism and threat to bicycle industry by DBS are the three main challenges that require investigation, especially, the fact that the booming DBS market may cause low profitability for local bicycle manufacturers and thus make the entire industry fragile. Feasibility of docked bikeshare and dockless bikeshare are compared and concluded in the end.",0965-8564,Not found
Using HLM to investigate the relationship between traffic accident risk of private vehicles and public transportation,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.005,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Public transportation is relatively safe and secure, although less convenient than private modes of transport. However, current trends indicate that, by 2030, road traffic injuries will be the fifth leading cause of death globally. This study proposes an approach for identifying hidden contributors to traffic risk in the major metropolitan cities of Taiwan. Our purpose is to offer a comprehensive econometrical framework, using Hierarchical Linear Modelling (HLM), which highlights important contributors to traffic accident risk at different levels of injuries for public transportation. Four models underlying HLM are used to characterize the traffic accident risk. Our empirical results indicate that random intercept and random slope with interaction of HLM (model 4) is the best model. In addition, there are significant regional differences in traffic accident risk depending on the use of public and private transportation, the length of bus routes, daily average number of bus frequency per route, gender, driving habits, and behaviour. Results show that, when the length of bus routes increases by 50% in a city with well-developed infrastructure, such as Taipei, the accident risk would reduce the crash risk from 1.66 to 1.43 (decreases by 0.23), corresponding to 3450 casualties, and the total accident expense can be reduced by NT$ 1 US$1 = NT$30. 1 3 billion. If daily average number of bus frequency per route in Taichung increases by 50%, there are almost 3000 fewer casualties, and the accident expense decreases by NT$9.6 billion.

Employing policies that aim to reduce car use would be key to decrease transport-related emissions. However, such policies need to be accepted by the public to be successful. In the current paper, we examine whether support for car use reduction policies can be predicted by the Value-Belief-Norm theory (VBN; Stern, 2000), reflecting a process of value triggered norm-activation about reducing one’s car use. Notably, we tested the VBN theory in Russia, which is a post-socialist country with a high car use and high transport-related CO2 emissions. As expected, findings indicate that high endorsement of biospheric values is associated with high environmental concern, which is related to an increased awareness of environmental consequences of car use, and a high ascription of responsibility of one’s own contribution to environmental problems related to car use. This process leads to strengthening personal norms to reduce own car use, which were associated with higher acceptability of car use reduction policies. The findings indicate that policies that aim at increased support for car use reduction in Russia could target biospheric values and activate personal norms.",0965-8564,Not found

An online stated choice experiment was conducted on a sample of regular car drivers residing in Sydney and its neighbouring suburbs. The collected data is analysed using a latent class choice modelling framework which provides characteristics and choice preferences of subgroups of individuals, thus making it attractive to policy makers. Results show that nearly three-quarters of the sample have a negative and significant disutility towards the number of S&Gs experienced.

Airline capacity decisions under supply-demand equilibrium of Australia's domestic aviation market,10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.039,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Australia is especially reliant on air transportation because of the geographical distribution of the urban centers across the country. This paper seeks to identify the antecedents of the capacity decisions of the airlines operating in Australian domestic aviation market. We examine the factors on both sides of the supply-demand equilibrium using monthly data of twenty-one major domestic routes linking eight major cities between January 2004 and December 2015. To investigate the relationship between flight demand and the variables of capacity decisions (flight frequency, aircraft size, load factor, and available seats), the pooled series cross-sectional data are analyzed using a two-stage least-squares method to model the supply-demand interaction. The results statistically differentiate the airlines’ strategies regarding capacity decisions for the short-haul, medium-haul, and long-haul routes. The results suggest that competition would lead to more flights, smaller aircraft size, lower load factors, and more available seats in all markets. Low-cost carriers play a key role in the short-haul market. Higher jet fuel prices scales up aircraft size on all flight routes. Notably, the socio-economic parameters of population and employment rates affect flight demand more strongly on the long-haul routes than other routes.",0965-8564,Not found
Pricing and investment in alternative transport infrastructures,10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.040,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Pricing and investment decisions are not independent; causality in the relationship cuts both ways. Optimal prices, once the investment has been made and is irreversible, are quite different compared with the situation contemplated in the ex-ante evaluation of the project, when no cost is already sunk, and various capacity options are still open. This paper deals with this critical aspect of the relationship in the planning process, when deciding on alternative transport infrastructures. Pricing affects demand and, hence, social welfare. The social profitability of the project can vary significantly depending on the pricing policy. Therefore, before deciding whether it is socially worthwhile to invest in a project, the government needs to be clear about the charging scheme that will be applied. In this paper we show that, when comparing different transport alternatives, a particular charging scheme may favor the creation of a particular transport infrastructure network, leading to irreversible long-term equilibria that would not be optimal under other charging schemes.",0965-8564,Not found
Prospects of cold ironing as an emissions reduction option,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.003,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Cold ironing is the process of providing shorepower to cover the energy demands of ships calling at ports. This technological solution can eliminate the emissions of auxiliary engines at berth, resulting in a global reduction of emissions if the grid powering the ships is an environmentally friendly energy source. This paper conducts a literature review of recent academic work in the field and presents the status of this technology worldwide and the current barriers for its further implementation. The use of cold ironing is mandatory in Californian ports for ship operators and as a result terminal and ship operators were required to invest in this technology. In Europe, all ports will be required to have cold ironing provision by the end of 2025. Other regulations that target local emissions such as Emission Control Areas can have a significant impact on whether cold ironing is used in the future as a potential compliance solution. This paper constructs a quantitative framework for the examination of the technology considering all stakeholders. The role of regulation is shown to be critical for the further adoption of this technology. Illustrative case studies are presented that consider the perspective of ship operators of various ship types, and terminal operators that opt to invest in shorepower facilities. The results of the case studies show that for medium and high fuel price scenarios there is economic motivation for ship operators to use cold ironing. For the port, the cost per abated ton of pollutants is much lower than current estimates of the external costs of pollutants. Therefore, shorepower may be a viable emissions reduction option for the maritime sector, provided that regulatory bodies assist the further adoption of the technology from ship operators and ports. The methodology can be useful to port and ship operators in examining the benefits of using cold ironing as an emissions reduction action.",0965-8564,Not found
Optimal pavement management: Resilient roads in support of emergency response of cyclone affected coastal areas,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.001,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Roads in poor road condition disrupt emergency operations in disaster-prone areas during emergency periods. Prolonged inundation of pavements from storm surge accelerates deterioration of pavements and increases maintenance cost. The objective of this study is to propose an optimized decision support system for pavement maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) operations guided by geo-physical risk and community vulnerabilities. A case study of regional highways, arterial and collector roads at the district of Barguna, in Bangladesh is selected given the frequency of cyclones and storm surges in this area. A geo-physical risk and vulnerability (GEOPHRIV) index was estimated for each road’s segment by integrating the geo-physical risk; community, structure and infrastructure vulnerabilities; and damage indices. Linear programming was applied to optimize M&R strategies to ensure good pavement condition for all roads at a minimum M&R budget. Lifecycle optimization of M&R operations estimated that USD 2.49 million is the minimum annual budget that ensures having good average road’s condition in the study area. Most of the annual M&R budget will be invested for overlay and resealing treatments on the roads at high and medium GEOPHRIV areas. This study helps transportation authorities to identify deteriorated pavement sections, maintain the pavement periodically to prevent or minimize damage before storm surge, and allocate resources for M&R operations.",0965-8564,Not found
A novel policy making aid model for the development of LNG fuelled ships,10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.038,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"In recent years, increasingly strict restrictions on ship emissions and continuously increasing prices of marine fuel oil have made the liquefied natural gas (LNG) using as a marine fuel more attractive, and LNG fuelled ships have therefore become more popular in many countries. However, there is still not much research on the development level of LNG fuelled ships in different countries, and no unified or corresponding evaluation criteria has been established to support relevant policy making, revealing a significant research gap to be fulfilled. In view of this, taking the advantages of the PEST (Political, Economic, Social and Technological factors) and the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis, this paper proposes a novel SRETI (Strategy, Regulation, Economics, Technology and Infrastructure) model for evaluating the development level of LNG fuelled ships in a particular region or country for self-assessment or comparative studies. The kernel of the model consists of the combination of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the evidential reasoning (ER) approach, thus being able to deal with evaluation data of both quantitative and qualitative features. China, Norway and the United States of America (USA) are selected in a real case study to demonstrate the feasibility of the model on the evaluation of the development of their LNG fuelled ships. The findings show that Norway is better than USA and China in terms of the development level of LNG fuelled ships. It is also revealed that the proposed SRETI model is capable of addressing uncertainties in subjective data provided by domain experts. A sensitive analysis is conducted as well to test the robustness of the SRETI model, and the results are in harmony with the axioms and hypotheses. This work provides policymakers with powerful insights into the development of LNG fuelled ships. It can also be tailored to evaluate the development of emerging technologies in other sectors.",0965-8564,Not found
Mean field theory of demand responsive ride pooling systems,10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.028,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The dynamics of demand responsive ride pooling (DRRP) systems is considered in a mean-field framework. The relevant dimensionless quantities determining the performance and viability of the system are identified. In the presence of an already established dominant market participant with comparable service quality (like, e.g., the private car), the mutual interaction of the actors (i.e., the customers sharing rides) by virtue of the route assignment algorithm gives rise to a discontinuous transition between two strongly different modes of operation. One of them represents the typical (unfavorable) performance of current ride pooling systems, while the other represents a new mode of operation in which virtually all customers use DRRP.",0965-8564,Not found
Understanding the impact of reoccurring and non-financial incentives on plug-in electric vehicle adoption – A review,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.002,119,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The market introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) is being partially driven by policy interventions. One type of intervention is reoccurring and non-financial incentives, these differ from financial purchase incentives which are a one-time financial incentive associated with the purchase of a PEV. Reoccurring and non-financial incentives include special lane access for PEVs (e.g. HOV/carpool lanes, bus lanes), parking incentives, charging infrastructure development, road toll fee waivers, and licensing incentives. They also include disincentives such as gasoline tax or annual vehicle taxes. The impact of these incentives differs between regions partially due to differences in traffic conditions, travel patterns, consumer preferences, and other local variations. Due to these differences, it is challenging to rank the importance of these incentives, however existing research shows that they all can have a positive impact on PEV adoption. Policymakers wishing to promote the introduction of PEVs will need to consider local travel patterns, the regulatory environment, and consumer preferences to determine the most viable policy interventions for their region.",0965-8564,Not found
Consensus planning in transport: The case of Vancouver's transportation plebiscite,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.014,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"In 2015, a plebiscite was held on a new source of funding to support the expansion of the transit network in the Lower Mainland of Vancouver. Thus, in a region that has achieved admirable results over several decades through a strategic planning system based on a consensus model, civic leaders were forced to step outside this model to argue the case for a 0.5% increase to a local goods and service tax. This pitted a ‘no new tax’ grouping against a Better Transit and Transportation Coalition which brought supporters from across the community including from business, the unions, the environmental sector and students in support of the ‘yes’ case and the package of works crafted by consensus among municipal leaders. In this paper, we draw on in-depth key informant interviews with transportation and land use planners, municipal politicians and individuals involved in the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ campaigns built around the 2015 transport plebiscite. We show how the plebiscite was framed and how a critical component of Vancouver’s planning ethos – consensus decision-making – catalysed the formation of the coalition of ‘yes’ campaign supporters. Despite its defeat, this coalition remained persistent and unified in their support for the development of a new funding stream and for the continued expansion of transit infrastructure across the Lower Mainland. The paper draws lessons from the transit plebiscite and how its outcome highlight the unique role that consensus planning can play in achieving progressive outcomes to politically vexing questions in transport planning in Vancouver and elsewhere.",0965-8564,Not found
The accuracy of benefit-cost analyses (BCAs) in transportation: An ex-post evaluation of road projects,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.023,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Ex-post evaluations of benefit-cost analyses (BCAs) of transportation projects are scarce in the literature. If conducted frequently, they could reveal the extent to which objectives are achieved and may give inputs that can improve the quality of ex-ante BCAs. We first explain the usefulness of ex-post BCA evaluations of transportation projects, depending on which planning phase a project is in. We then perform ex-post BCAs on 27 Norwegian road projects that have been in service for at least 5 years and compare the results with the ex-ante BCAs that were presented to the decision-makers. We use two different measures of aggregating the magnitudes of accuracy; the Mean Percentage Error (MPE) and Mean Absolute Percentage (MAPE). Using MPE, we find that: (1) ex-ante BCAs underestimate the actual net present value (NPV) by 50% on average and, the NPV per dollar invested by a mere 0.14% points on average; (2) the traffic level and traffic growth rates are often underestimated ex-ante, leading to an underestimation of the benefits and; (3) construction costs are underestimated by 5% on average, which is too small to offset the observed underestimation of benefits. By default, MAPE shows higher values of inaccuracies implying that one should not be indifferent as to the measure used. Overall, the Norwegian ex-ante BCAs perform fairly well. We urge that the authorities concerned must improve their traffic forecasts and construction cost estimates to assure that the ex-ante objectives are met. The upkeep of ex-ante data is essential to enable ex-post evaluation which, ceteris paribus, will enhance the transparency and credibility of BCA as an appropriate decision-making tool.",0965-8564,Not found
Market power and its determinants in the Chinese railway industry,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.003,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"This study measures the degree of market power of China’s railway operator and analyzes its determining factors. A newly-developed stochastic frontier method is used to estimate the Lerner indexes of the operator’s 18 regional railway bureaus from 1995 to 2014. Regressions are then conducted on these indexes to identify the determining factors of market power in this industry and explain any regional heterogeneity. We find that China’s railway operator exercises significant market power with an overall positive Lerner index. Furthermore, obvious regional heterogeneity in market power exists among the railway bureaus. Railway bureaus in Eastern China typically have the highest Lerner index scores, owing probably to greater regional rail demand and/or the economies of traffic density in rail operation. We find that China’s dramatic high-speed rail development in recent years appears to have no effect on the overall market power of the rail operator. On the other hand, railway market deregulation, especially a series of price liberalizations in recent years, may provide railway bureaus with more autonomy to exert their market power, widening observed heterogeneity.",0965-8564,Not found
Carsharing use by college students: The case of Milan and Rome,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.017,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"The paper analyses carsharing (CS) use by college students in the Italian cities of Rome and Milan. We use an adapted stated preference approach to study CS preferences by collecting information on the individual mobility patterns and by distinguishing between commuting and non-commuting trips. We develop six hypothetical scenarios to explore how mobility decision would change when varying the characteristics of the current CS supply. We estimate a random parameter discrete choice model to evaluate CS preferences and simulated CS demand. The main finding is that college students use CS on an occasional basis and vary rarely their habitual transport choice. The students prefer the free-floating CS type over the station-based or roundtrip one. Lower fares and a higher CS supply of preferably electric cars would increase the number of CS student users from the current 2% to up to 10–15%. CS substitutes mainly the private car and, to a lesser extent, public transport.",0965-8564,Not found
Which curves are dangerous? A network-wide analysis of traffic crash and infrastructure data,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.001,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"We conducted spatial analyses of traffic crashes, which took place in Czechia over 2010–2016, with respect to the road geometry data. The aim of the work was to identify hazardous road sub-segments where higher than expected numbers of traffic crashes occur. The entire Czech road network (58,200 km) was segmented at intersections into 39,074 between-intersection segments of varying lengths. Each road segment was further automatically sectioned, according to its horizontal alignment, into geometry-homogenous units (horizontal curves and tangents). Overall, 257,101 curves, defined as curved sections with radii below 2100 m, and 136,388 tangents, were identified. Subsequently, traffic crashes were joined to the respective geometrical units to determine their hazardousness. The degree of hazardousness was determined relatively, on a segment-by-segment basis, in order to eliminate the lack of precise traffic exposure data. In addition, the exact binomial test and Bayesian inference were used to identify the most hazardous horizontal curves. It was found that, in general, the curves with a higher crash risk have lower radii than the other curves. We identified the geographical locations of all curves with a high crash hazard. We also ranked the curves according to the crash hazard. Approximately ten percent of road segments contained at least one hazardous horizontal curve. 6943 significantly hazardous curves were identified by the use of the exact binomial test. The Bayesian inference reduced this number to 1395 (0.31% of the entire road network) and ranked them according to the Bayes factor. The most hazardous curve was 45 m long and contained 8.7 traffic crashes per year. Its hazard rate accounted for 37.4. This state-wide analysis of primary data was conducted over an extremely short time (up to 3 days) as theresult of an application of an efficient algorithm for automatic road curvature determination.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of fare complexity on rail demand,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.020,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"The current rail fare structure in the UK is widely considered to be complex. It offers flexibility by including many different types of tickets but it can also cause confusion, which may lead some to a negative view towards rail travel and thereby potentially inhibit demand, in comparison to a simpler fare regime. This study used an innovative stated preference survey to quantify the demand effects of fare complexity, focusing on Advance tickets (those that are restricted to a particular train service). The choice experiment was designed to mirror very closely the actual booking experience when buying tickets online, in all its complexity. Participants could choose among up to 531 different ticket type combinations for the outward and return legs of a trip and from up to 25 possible train services for each leg. The key design attribute was complexity, defined as the range of different Advance tickets on offer. The survey was applied to a sample of 1027 users and 179 non-users of the rail network on the London-Leeds route. The modelling of the choices with a nested mixed logit model suggested that, all else equal, reducing complexity by removing Advance tickets would lead to a substantial reduction of demand (11 to 45%, depending on route segment). Equalizing the price of Advance tickets for all train services was predicted to cause a smaller reduction (3–6%). By contrast, increasing complexity by adding new Flexible Advance tickets (valid on the services immediately before or after the chosen service) would increase demand by 4–15%. These findings run counter to the hypothesis that simplifying the fare structure would lead to increases in demand for rail travel.",0965-8564,Not found

The measurement model of PSI is established based on PLS-SEM. Based on the passenger satisfaction data covering 58 Chinese public transport operators of 13 cities, an empirical analysis was carried out. Conclusions are summarized as follows: ① The convenience, safety, reliability, comfort and operational service, which are belonged to passenger perceived quality, have a significant direct positive effect on the passenger satisfaction. ② The correlations between passenger expectations, passenger perceived value, passenger loyalty and passenger satisfaction are all significant direct positive. ③ The correlations between passenger satisfaction, passenger loyalty and passenger complaint are all direct negative. ④ Passenger satisfaction index score of 13 cities is as low as 68.88.

Express delivery with high-speed railway: Definitely feasible or just a publicity stunt,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.011,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"When the construction of a large-scale high-speed railway (HSR) network is completed, how to make use of its transportation capacity is a consequent problem that needs to be resolved. Over the past few years, railway managers have launched the concept of high-speed rail express delivery (HSReD), with the aim of effectively utilizing the remaining passenger transportation capacity for express delivery services. This study analyzes the adaptability of HSReD to the HSR network according to the capacity utilization ratios of various HSR lines. First, the definition of the transportation capacity of the HSReD on the HSR network is proposed. Second, the level of service (LoS) of HSReD is measured. Then, the relationships among the LoS of HSReD, train schedule, and target market are analyzed. Next, based on the real operating environment, including different LoSs and capacity occupancies, an improved Arc-Route mathematical model for calculating the transport volume of HSReD parcels on the HSR network is built. A solution algorithm is designed. The proposed mathematical model is used to empirically analyze the adaptability of the HSReD on China’s HSR network, on which express parcels among 27 provinces are carried. Results show that: (a) the average utilization rate of transportation capacity of HSReD accounts for approximately 5.5% of the total transportation capacity of the entire HSR network. That is, currently, the capacity of the network is in a good state of adaptation, which can fully meet all transport demands. (b) Based on the annual growth rate of 50% of the express delivery amount in China, the transportation capacity of HSReD can meet the transport demand for only 5 years. In 2021, the transport volume of the HSReD parcels on China’s HSR network will reach the limit of the transportation capacity. Accordingly, this study provides policy suggestions for the current and future development of the HSReD on China’s HSR network.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper evaluates the port choice decision when competition between ports exists by using several data sources, including the official records of imports and exports in Colombia. Results show that the cost of port access, the frequency of maritime lines, maritime freight rates, maritime travel time, origin or destination and the type of cargo, play a key role in the port selection process. Major infrastructure projects influence port choice mainly through their impact on perceived costs. Policies and strategies aimed to improve the efficiency of a port’s operation and their levels of service, such as increasing the frequencies of lines or decreasing maritime freight and transit times, could have a substantial impact on demand.",0965-8564,Not found
Children's independent travel to and from primary school: Evidence from a suburban town in Germany,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.016,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"The paper studies the factors that contribute to understand children's independent travel – i.e. not being escorted by an adult – to and from primary school in Germany. Binary logit regression is employed, and the data used are taken from a survey among parents of children in seven schools in a medium-sized suburban town. This is the first paper from Germany that simultaneously looks at the full range of dimensions that may help understand children's independent travel: (1) trip characteristics, (2) child characteristics, (3) the household context, (4) subjective concerns, attitudes and perceptions, (5) the transport environment, (6) the built environment and (7) the social environment. In contrast to the majority of studies in the field, an attempt was made to capture a holistic picture of the transport and land-use environment along the route, while at the same time some key attributes of the route were used as separate variables. Perhaps the most notable contribution to research is the distinct differences that we found between outward and return trips. While the morning trip was characterised by distinct impacts of the built and transport environment, most variables turned out insignificant in the afternoon model. Conversely, more attitudinal dimensions turned out significant in the return trip. Some of our findings are clearly relevant for policy. For instance, traffic calming is associated with higher levels of independent travel, while routes characterised by industry and trade, high-speed roads, and zebra-crossings that need to be crossed are associated with lower levels of independent travel. The effects of perceptions and attitudes we find can be taken as starting points for soft policies such as awareness campaigns or traffic education.",0965-8564,Not found

Geographic mobility of recent immigrants and urban transit demand in the U.S.: New evidence and planning implications,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.019,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Residential mobility rates in the U.S. have been in steady decline. Most notably, between 2005 and 2013, one-year intercity migration rate for immigrants has decreased by 0.7 percentage-points, compared to a 0.2 percentage-point decline for the U.S.-born population. Literature on urban implications of geographic mobility suggests that consideration of migration trends, or population flows, can improve urban planning, including transportation. Our research focuses on recent immigrants, a group that significantly contributes to public transit ridership in the U.S. In this study, we analyze the influence of the annual average in-migration rate of recent immigrants to various urban areas from within the country on transit ridership changes across the urban areas between 2008 and 2013. We also compare this effect with the effect of annual average in-migration rate of new immigrants to various urban areas from foreign countries. While the average effect of inflow of new foreign migrants on transit demand is suggested in the literature, distinguishing the transit demand of immigrants that are not movers and those that are movers from various locations remains unexplored. We derive migration flows from the American Community Survey microdata, and transit ridership from the U.S. National Transit Database. We perform geospatial analysis to overcome several constraints that make exploration of the migration-transportation connection difficult, particularly the lack of uniformity in geographic boundaries used for data presentation across and within government agencies, and over time. Our results indicate that consideration of domestic in-migration rates of recent immigrants can improve transit demand forecasting. As past literature has found, recent immigrants are highly likely to use transit. Recent immigrant migrants that have arrived directly from another country are even more likely to use transit. Interestingly, recent immigrants that move to a metropolitan area from another location in the U.S. are relatively less likely to use transit. Among domestic migrants, however, those that move to cities undergoing large increase in transit service relative to population are more likely to use transit. High population and transit stop density of both previous and current cities seem to positively affect transit mode choice for commute trips of recent immigrant movers. Declining inter-urban mobility among recent immigrants can indeed alter future transit demand trends. Transit agencies should not treat recent immigrants as a monolithic group. Consideration of the migration patterns of various types of recent immigrants, and factors that determine those patterns, can improve demand forecasting and planning.",0965-8564,Not found
The effect of parenthood on travel behavior: Evidence from the California household travel survey,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.022,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Literature suggests that young children have a significant influence on activity patterns and time-use of adult men and women in dual-earner households. The resultant impact on travel behavior, however, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we use the 2012–13 California Household Travel Survey to compare daily (weekday) travel behavior of adult men and women belonging to dual-earner heterosexual couple households without children, with their adult counterparts in dual-earner heterosexual nuclear households with one or more young (aged 15 years or less) children living in urban California. We find that the presence of young children is, on average, associated with relatively higher auto use, and lower levels of physically active travel (i.e., walking and bicycling) and public transit use. Specifically, parents of school-age (6–15 years) children, without other small (5 years or less) children, are found to engage in significantly more auto use than childless couples. The likelihood of engaging in 20 min or more of active travel per day falls as couples transition to parenthood, and drops further as small children turn school-age. The likelihood of making at least one transit trip per day follows a similar pattern. We also find that the negative impact of young children on average, and school-age children in particular, on adults’ active travel is significantly greater for men than women. Additionally, we identify factors that can help reduce gender inequality in auto use and active travel within households with one or more young children. This study enhances our understanding of travel behavior variations across household types in cities, and over the life courses of individuals.

Implications of traffic signal cybersecurity on potential deliberate traffic disruptions,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.009,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Traffic control systems, including signal controllers, sensors, and centralized coordination software, all have the capacity to be vulnerable to malicious attacks. Although several studies on outages, attacks, and cybersecurity have been conducted in the literature, the effects of district-wide attacks on signals have not been specifically studied in-depth. There is a need for risk assessments to be conducted to establish resilient policies within traffic operations agencies. A key factor in assessing risk is in gaining an idea of the hypothetical impact of an outage. In this preliminary study, a dynamic traffic assignment network is used to model a central business district, where traffic signal-controlled intersections are cyberattacked and selectively disabled (effectively replaced with four-way stops). In one scenario, total delay is multiplied 4.3 times when 26 signals are chosen and disabled according to maximum, decreasing intersection traffic volume. In scenarios where the attacker prioritizes the selection of signals by maximizing the number of travelers affected, 7 signals are needed to exert the same impact.",0965-8564,Not found

On the potential for one-way electric vehicle car-sharing in future mobility systems,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.003,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"City transport systems often struggle to cope with high volumes of traffic and become congested, despite the use of various traffic management strategies. The concentration of traffic around city centres results in pollution and poor urban air quality, although the increasing popularity of electric vehicles is helping ameliorate these effects. One reason for the growing momentum behind electric vehicles is the emergence of mobility operators such as car-sharing companies, who target users wishing to rent out vehicles on a short-term basis. There is currently rapid growth in one-way car-sharing, in which the vehicle can be dropped off at a different location to the pickup point. Crucially, one-way car-sharing gives the opportunity for travellers to utilise car-sharing in conjunction with other modes, such as public transport modes, for their journey provided the requisite intermodal connections are present. This paper looks at how one-way electric vehicle car-sharing systems have the potential to become important components of future city transport systems.

Balancing competition and cooperation: Evidence from transatlantic airline markets,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.008,120,2019-02-01,2019,2,"In the last two decades, airline alliances were not only successful in extending the size of their networks, but also received approvals by public authorities to intensify their cooperation up to merger-like revenue-sharing joint ventures (JVs). We empirically investigate the impact of the implementation of such joint ventures on both the respective airlines’ network structure and their productive efficiency. Using U.S. DOT T100 International Segment data and applying airline-market fixed effects models, we find that joint ventures – compared to services with a lower degree of cooperation – lead to a 3–5 percent increase in seat capacity between the respective partner airlines’ hub airports; however, this is done at the expense of services elsewhere in the network. Productive efficiency, as measured by load factors, is found to be 0.5–5 percent lower for joint venture routes compared to routes operated under antitrust immunity only. We use our empirical results to discuss implications for the balancing of competition and cooperation in transatlantic airline markets.",0965-8564,Not found
Socio-spatial and temporal dimensions of transport equity for London's night time economy,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.024,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"The sustainable mobility paradigm has dominated the urban transport research agenda for more than a decade. This paradigm focuses on the environmental impacts of travel and the imperative for climate change mitigation, however the specific outcomes of transport in terms of trip type and purpose are not robustly conceptualised, with limited intellectual foundations to understand the ethical considerations of transport service provision. This paper critically considers transport strategies recently developed for London’s Night Time Economy, including policy discourse and technical approaches that shape of transport services provision at night. The case study evaluates the spatiotemporal dimensions of equity. Analysis of policy discourses revealed how night time transport are conceived as an instrumental means to grow the ‘Night Time Economy’, drawing from the conventional wisdom linking accessibility improvements with economic expansion. This strategy viewed ‘London at night’ as a vehicle for economic development, focusing on the consumption-side of the economy and improving individuals’ access to entertainment and recreation. Policy discourse recognised the existence of night-time workers in sectors outside arts and recreation, however, attempts to broaden the ‘Night Time Economy’ agenda to accommodate the travel needs of night-time workers were lost through the narrow selection of accessibility metrics used in transport planning practice. This case demonstrates a missed opportunity to improve transport equity across spatial and temporal dimensions, as night-time workers face severe accessibility barriers, often relying on low-frequency bus services that have inadequate service coverage across Greater London. Scrutinising socio-spatial and temporal dimensions of transport provision can advance more systematic critical perspectives on transport equity by integrating a variety of distributional issues and linking more closely to the practical barriers faced by night-time workers to access transport.",0965-8564,Not found

Then we apply the actual example of Ryanair and Qunar.com to analyze the results under different circumstances. The main findings are: 1. Without regard to other costs, Ryanair should select B757 as the single aircraft type to replace A320. 2. For the low-cost carriers, the main channel to sell tickets should be official website. 3.

"The contradictions of bike-share benefits, purposes and outcomes",10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.031,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Bicycle Sharing Systems (BSS) are now ubiquitous due to their plausible environmental and social benefits promoted by municipalities, operators and technology providers. Recent practices and literature however undermines many suggested benefits of BSS showing they mostly facilitate transport for already privileged demographics in increasingly exclusive urban cores. Additionally, case study performance estimates in Europe and North America commonly show low usage rates further undermining promoted benefits. In the context of urban transports existing social injustice, energy consumption and land use, which cannot be sustained, this work, drawing on data analysis, interviews and literature and media review in North America and Europe, presents how existing BSS deployments have intrinsic flaws. These convenient luxuries are typically not effective or less so than familiar, proven and less technologically innovative opportunities at achieving greater cycling modal share. This paper illustrates how with BSS deployments converge many actors, promoting success and beneficial narratives, gain advantage through diverse outcomes while residents subsidize the services economically, through public land or advertising, while receiving few benefits. Municipalities and decision makers regularly use BSS to promote themselves, their city, attract investment and develop local pride in representatives and their policy. Beyond being a good example of policy boosterism and rich in rhetoric, BSS often have less effective or just outcomes than alternative transport policies. Advertisers meanwhile utilize sustainability narratives to capitalize on new markets and commodification opportunities while effectively undermining promoted BSS outcomes. This paper provides a critical history of BSS, summarizes their stated purposes and benefits and utilizes a smart-city critique framework to evaluate outcomes. This work concludes that most BSS typically benefit the privileged, help little to increase mass cycling transport and are used as easily deployable technological (false) solutions to contemporary problems while advancing unjust tendencies to privatize public space and services.",0965-8564,https://github.com/Robinlovelace/cycle-hire-inclusive
"Potential impacts of bike-and-ride on job accessibility and spatial equity in São Paulo, Brazil",10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.022,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"This paper examines the potential of the bicycle, as an access mode for transit trips, to reduce spatiotemporal inequalities in job accessibility in the megacity of São Paulo, Brazil. Three temporally dynamic potential job accessibility models are developed, (i) a GTFS-based (General |Transit Feed Specification) walk-and-ride model, (ii) an integrated GTFS-based bike-and-ride model that incorporates topography constraints, the availability of dedicated cycling infrastructure, waiting times at intersections and car traffic levels, and (iii) a car model that accounts for congestion using TomTom speed profiles. Cluster analysis is then used to analyze the geographic distribution of the associated improvements. The results show that bike-and-ride has the potential to substantially increase job accessibility in the different areas of the city, but does not result in a more equal spatial distribution of job accessibility, as measured by Gini coefficients. Most of the improvements are centered in middle to high income areas with good accessibility. Peripheral areas, that tend to be the poorest and have the lowest accessibility by transit, improve the least. The inclusion of the bicycle is not enough to counteract all of the other forces causing low job accessibility in these areas.",0965-8564,Not found
"Fleet performance and cost evaluation of a shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) fleet: A case study for Austin, Texas",10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.025,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) have gained significant public interest as a possible less expensive, safer and more efficient version of today’s transportation networking companies (TNCs) and taxis. One way to expand on the possible benefits of an SAV fleet is through electric vehicles (EVs), which tend to be more energy efficient, more reliable, quicker, and may reduce system-wide emissions when coupled with renewable power. EVs are quickly becoming more financially viable as the price of these vehicles drops and charging infrastructure is appearing in more and more locations across the world. EVs are disadvantaged by their relatively short range and long recharge times, so it is important to understand how these factors will affect an electrified SAV (SAEV) fleet in terms of vehicle miles traveled (VMT), vehicle productivity, and response times. Perhaps the most important factor to consider before implementation is cost, since it is quite unlikely that a fleet operator will elect to use an EV fleet when a gasoline fleet is more profitable. This study makes in-depth estimates of the cost of this SAEV fleet based on vehicle purchasing costs, vehicle maintenance, batteries, electricity, charger construction (including land acquisition and paving), charger maintenance, insurance, registration and general administrative costs. These costs are estimated at low-, high- and mid-cost scenarios, where mid-cost is the most expected. This study performed a simulation of SAEVs across the Austin, Texas 6-county region under 6 different fleet scenarios to assess what factors make the fleet the most profitable and provide the best customer experience. The simulation process features thoughtful charging strategies, dynamic ridesharing, mode choice, and a multi-step search algorithm. Results showed that for all metrics studied, the gasoline hybrid-electric (HEV) fleet performed better than EV fleets, while remaining more profitable, providing response times of 4.5 min compared to 5.5 min. The HEV fleet is the more profitable option until the cost of gasoline exceeds $10 per gallon or the cost of a long-range EV falls below $16,000 through subsidies. Of all the EVs studied, the long-range fast-charging scenario not only provides the best service in terms of all metrics studied, but is by far the most profitable. Even though EVs may not be financially advantageous in the near term, the environmental benefits could be substantial; EVs have the potential to provide zero-carbon transportation when coupled with a renewable power grid. Gasoline vehicles have no such potential. Environmentalism tends to have little effect on financial decisions, but a carbon tax could change that perspective.",0965-8564,Not found
Cycling investment expedience: Energy expenditure based Cost-Path Analysis of national census bicycle commuting data,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.019,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"“The bicycle share has risen to a level of 7%” – This newsletter headline is just one example that highlights the growing interest of current Austrian transport-policy in fostering bicycle traffic. But where is it most expedient to invest into new infrastructure or initiatives? This work seeks to shed light on the question and therefore presents a new supporting methodology for planners and decision-makers that builds upon body-energy consumption and relies on Austrian census commuter data. The main challenges and scientific contributions lie in the proposal of a new raster-based GIS model to calculate the energetic demand between and inside of Austrian municipalities, overcoming limitations of previous approaches. A regression analysis is conducted in order to check for a statistical relationship between cycle-share and body energy expenditure. This further allows the calculation of a potential value for investments as the deviation between the energetically predicted cycle-share and the present cycling level. Topography and routing distance are reported to explain between 53 and 63 percent of intra- and interzonal bicycle shares. It is therefore concluded that body energy consumption has a major impact on cycling. The work ends with the discussion of results and provides a perspective on the usage of this evidence-based methodology in national and international planning and research. Additionally, a discussion of the results in the context of the simultaneously developed British Propensity to Cycle Tool is provided.",0965-8564,Not found
Value of demand information in autonomous mobility-on-demand systems,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.018,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Effective management of demand information is a critical factor in the successful operation of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems. This paper classifies, measures and evaluates the demand information for an AMoD system. First, the paper studies demand information at both individual and aggregate levels and measures two critical attributes: dynamism and granularity. We identify the trade-offs between both attributes during the data collection and information inference processes and discuss the compatibility of the AMoD dispatching algorithms with different types of information. Second, the paper assesses the value of demand information through agent-based simulation experiments with the actual road network and travel demand in a major European city, where we assume a single operator monopolizes the AMoD service in the case study area but competes with other transportation modes. The performance of the AMoD system is evaluated from the perspectives of travelers, AMoD operators, and transportation authority in terms of the overall system performance. The paper tests multiple scenarios, combining different information levels, information dynamism, and information granularity, as well as various fleet sizes. Results show that aggregate demand information leads to more served requests, shorter wait time and higher profit through effective rebalancing, especially when supply is high and demand information is spatially granular. Individual demand information from in-advance requests also improves the system performance, the degree of which depends on the spatial disparity of requests and their coupled service priority. By designing hailing policies accordingly, the operator is able to maximize the potential benefits. The paper concludes that the strategic trade-offs of demand information need to be made regarding the information level, information dynamism, and information granularity. It also offers a broader discussion on the benefits and costs of demand information for key stakeholders including the users, the operator, and the society.",0965-8564,https://github.com/wenjian0202/mod-abm-2.0

These models facilitate estimation of direct, indirect, and total average causal effects, as well as individual and cumulative effects of transportation interventions that partially overlap in space. Such estimates can assist policymakers in assessing potentially reinforcing effects originating from multiple transportation interventions located in close proximity.

We then illustrate how NOBD can supplement traditional data in the studies of the equity and spatial implications of transit fares via an exploratory study of Brisbane, Australia.

Are larger and more complex port more productive? An analysis of Spanish port authorities,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.008,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Several Spanish ports have grown substantially in recent decades. Ports in Spain are heterogeneous in that they differ substantially in terms of complexity, size and traffic mix. We measure the productivity of Spanish port authorities and identify the drivers of productivity taking into account this heterogeneity in order to provide more meaningful estimates of efficiency and productivity change. Using a sample of 26 ports observed over the period 1993–2016, we classify these ports into two different groups according to their overall size and their importance in terms of individual outputs. Segregating the sample into these two distinct groups permits us to draw a more precise picture of the consequences for productivity of the changes that have occurred in the sector in Spain over the last quarter of a century. Using Data Envelopment Analysis techniques, we calculate and decompose Malmquist productivity indexes using a metafrontier analysis. We use these indexes to estimate an Arellano-Bond Generalised Method Moments model to explain the differences in productivity change. Our results show that the group of large and complex port authorities had a considerable technological advantage, being closer to the metafrontier on average than the other group. Relative size, which can be interpreted as a measure of complexity of the port authority, has a strong positive influence on productivity growth. Specialisation in solids, container cargo and general bulk also increased productivity growth, but specialisation in liquids has no effect.",0965-8564,Not found
Geographies of governance in the freight transport sector: The British case,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.020,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"This paper explores the changing geography of governance in the British freight transport sector. Policy and regulation have evolved in a neoliberal direction based on private sector provision of transport services, resulting in a much smaller role for the public sector. An exploration of the intersection between the previous institutional settings and the unfolding regulatory frameworks across water, rail and road modes of freight transport suggests that the differences in each mode also influence the levers available to address issues as they arise. The economic characteristics of the road haulage sector keep the system responsive to user needs, whereas the lack of a port regulator encourages rent seeking. The rail regulator intervenes in cases of anti-competitive practice but cannot prevent an oligopolistic market structure and relies on ongoing subsidy as road haulage does not pay its full share of external costs. A distinctive British geography of governance is revealed in the different liberalisation pathway it has followed compared to continental European countries. A key conclusion is that governance analysis must include not merely the formal governance arrangements but the ability and willingness to apply suitable instruments to regulate the market to maximize economic welfare.",0965-8564,Not found

Braess Paradox Detection,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.021,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"No-car zone is becoming a trend in many parts of the world, mainly driven by environmental motives. Recent data has shown that both vehicle kilometers traveled and car ownership are on the decline, especially in developed countries. This has been coupled with the rise of new urban mobility concepts such as smart mobility, car sharing, and green modes. Can we push for these policies without compromising traffic circulation? The Braess Paradox (BP) suggests that road closure can, in fact, improve traffic congestion; dubbed as the Braess Paradox Detection Problem (BPDP). This study aims to leverage the BP to boost the idea of the no-car zone. To this end, we formulate the BPDP as a bilevel problem and develop a heuristic methodology (a surrogate-based algorithm) to identify roads for closure in the heart of the cities to be reclaimed for green space, pedestrian plazas, and so on. Furthermore, our proposed formulation considers travel demand elasticity resulting from road-closure schemes while solving for the BPDP. We test the methodology using a real dataset, the road network of Winnipeg. The results indicate strong evidence and justification supporting the idea of no-car zone even in the heart of highly congested cities.",0965-8564,Not found

In addition to the financial budget provided by relevant agencies (e.g., governments), we consider fare revenue generated from the operations of previous completed rail projects as an internal source of funding for later rail projects.

We simulate spatial effects of automated driving for the Netherlands using LUCA, the Dutch spatial general equilibrium model. Two components of automation are accounted for: (i) more productive time use during car trips; (ii) fast and comfortable door-to-door automated public transit. We find that the car component results in population flight from cities, while the public transit component leads to population clustering in urban areas. A combination of the two may result in the population concentrating in the largest, most attractive cities, at the expense of smaller cities and non-urban regions. The simulations suggest that welfare benefits of automation are considerable, with up to 10% coming from population relocation and changes in land use. Our results are particularly relevant for countries where public transit claims a considerable share of urban mobility. Neglecting the impact of vehicle automation on public transit could result in biased policy recommendations.",0965-8564,Not found
"Safe, sustainable… but depoliticized and uneven – A critical view of urban transport policies in France",10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.023,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"This article offers a critical view of the contemporary urban policies undertaken in France in the name of safe, sustainable urban transport strategies. It seeks to show how a spatially and socially selective ordering is under way in French transport planning and policies by presenting an overview of research and empirical results dealing with the narratives and the implementation of these policies. Firstly, urban transport policies were analysed as narratives. Stressing users’ individual responsibility and their capacity to adopt economically rational behaviours, and conveying moral injunctions for them to adopt the ‘right’, safe, healthy, sustainable mobility behaviours, a depoliticized framing of issues characterizes these public policies. Referring to theoretical frameworks related to neoliberalisation as a rationality, our hypothesis is that a neoliberal rationality feeds these policies by ignoring a certain number of macrosocial determinants. Moreover, the use of morality works as a powerful democratic anaesthetic that dissolves any objection. Secondly, we studied how these policies, legitimated by ‘noble causes’ and depoliticized, influence the organization of traffic in the city, and to what extent they lead to a selective and uneven treatment of urban spaces. While sustainable mobility is frequently presented as a major objective in the field of urban planning for transport and travel, contemporary policies do not seek to reduce polluting modes of travel overall. They rather seek to direct them onto bypass road infrastructures to reduce their negative impacts on the city’s main sites. ‘Sustainable’ policies oppose the car only in certain spaces and for certain uses. With reference to theoretical frameworks related to the entrepreneurial mutation of urban policies, our interpretation is that these policies are part of urban marketing strategies of cities engaged in inter-urban competition processes. These policies lead to an increase in the value and attractiveness of strategic areas of the city, and tend to displace problems (cars, noise, pollution…, and deprived populations) to other parts of the urban territory.",0965-8564,Not found
Schedule creep – In search of an uncongested baseline block time by examining scheduled flight block times worldwide 1986–2016,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.006,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Based on a stratified random sampling of airlines’ schedules for 200 heavily travelled directional nonstop airport pairs, this paper examines systematically how scheduled block times in non-stop flights have changed from 1986 to 2016. Three econometric analyses, by way of a 10th percentile quantile regression, 15th percentile quantile regression and ordinary least-squares regression, show that after accounting for the effects of air traffic growth, airport-specific congestion, flight delays, number of seat per flight, aircraft type, flight heading, airport slot policy, other airport-specific anomalies, airline-specific policies and changes in crude oil price, scheduled block times have been growing at a pace between 0.21 and 0.33 min per year depending on the regression model, or a total of between 6.2 and 9.8 min per flight from 1986 to 2016. Over-flying crowded parts of Europe contributes to an increase of 4.1 min of block time in 2016 compared with 1986, while over-flying crowded parts of China contributes to a corresponding increase of 8.9 min of block time. Slot-based practices at one end of an airport pair reduce the scheduled block times between 1.3 and 2.0 min, and this reduction can vary slightly over time in depending on the regression model. Regional influences add to the changes in scheduled block times. Those airport pairs within north-eastern U.S. have scheduled block times between 3.6 and 4.0 min longer than their counterparts in the rest of North America, which in turn grow at 0.10 min per year in the 10th percentile regression. Airline-specific policies also add to further changes to the scheduled block times, with some starting with longer times in 1986 and reducing theirs over the years while others starting with shorter times in 1986 and increasing theirs over the years. Hub-specific adjustments to scheduled block times by individual airlines are also observed. Airlines with increasing frequency share at the departure and arrival airports, or in the non-stop airport pair itself, are shown to reduce the scheduled block times of that route. The overall increase from the projected baseline block times in 1986 to the actual scheduled block times in 2016 is 19.2 min per flight from the sampled nonstop city-pairs, consistent with a previous study on buffers in flight schedules within the U.S. Overall, un-adjusted scheduled block times are not a reliable benchmark for determining true flight delays, but using a percentile statistics from past flight records to determine a minimum feasible block time is a reasonable estimate even if aircraft types are not explicitly accounted for.",0965-8564,Not found
Driving aggressiveness management policy to enhance the performance of mixed traffic conditions in automated driving environments,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.010,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"The advancement of vehicular technologies for automated driving will lead to a mixed traffic flow that depends on the interaction between automated vehicles (AVs) and manually driven vehicles (MVs) because the market penetration rate (MPR) of AVs will gradually increase over time. Because automated driving environments provide us with a valuable opportunity for controlling individual vehicle operation, a strategic policy for managing AVs operation is expected to enhance the performance of the traffic stream. Therefore, the operation of AVs needs to be properly determined to cope with various traffic and road conditions and thereby facilitate smooth and effective vehicle interactions. This study proposed a novel traffic management strategy in automated driving environments by adjusting the driving aggressiveness of AV operation, defined as automated driving aggressiveness (AuDA). VISSIM microscopic simulation experiments were conducted to derive the proper AuDAs to enhance both the traffic safety and the mobility performance. Traffic conflict rates and average travel speeds were used as indicators for the performance of safety and operations. While conducting the simulations, the level of service (LOS) and MPR of the AVs were also considered. In addition, the relationship between key variables for adaptive cruise control (ACC) operations and AuDA policies was explored to better support the understanding of how the proposed methodology works in practice. Promising results showed that the proposed methodology would be effective in optimizing the performance of mixed traffic conditions.

However, a simple average hides the fact that many people, young and old, are totally hostile to the concept and a smaller number totally in favour. AVs are part of a technological development linked in general to robots, and regression analysis finds attitudes tend to be linked to both general attitudes to robots and individual self-interest relating specifically to AVs. Consistent with the literature, we find the young to be more in favour than the elderly. There are other differences, with males, those in cities and the more educated being more in favour, as well as differences between countries.

A paper-pencil based survey instrument was designed to collect importance-performance data in five-point Likert-type scale from parents of school children with respect to available modes for school trips in Kolkata city. A database of 5929 responses was developed. The priority areas of intervention were identified using revised importance-performance analysis (revised-IPA) with fuzzy c-mean clustering. The analysis technique was instrumental in classifying school trip attributes under the clusters, namely ‘basic factors’, ‘performance factors’, and ‘excitement factors’. Management schemes namely, ‘concentrate here’, ‘keep up good work’, ‘possible overkill’, and ‘low priority’, for the shared modes of school trip were identified based on the perception of parents. Priority areas of interventions for shared modes were suggested by comparing the factor structure and the management schemes. The results indicate that there is a substantial difference in the requirements of ‘car owning’ and ‘non-car owning’ parents towards shared modes of school trip. The study identified weaknesses in the shared modes of school trip and highlighted areas of interventions necessary to improve the quality of school-bus and shared-cab in the context of Kolkata city. Although the work presented here is case specific, the methodology could be used suitably in formulating policy measures for improvement of school trips considering specific mode and requirements of target user group in other urban areas.",0965-8564,Not found
The Transportation-growth nexus in USA: Fresh insights from pre-post global crisis period,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.011,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"This paper examines the transportation-growth nexus for the USA by taking monthly data for the period of 2000–2017. The Quantile-on-Quantile (QQ) approach introduced by Sim and Zhou (2015) is applied for empirical analysis. The empirical results show that the effect of economic growth (transportation services with sub-indices) on transportation services with sub-indices (economic growth) is positive for the USA during the pre-post crisis period. Overall, the results have shown the positive effect of transportation on economic growth, however the magnitude of the effect is intensified in the post crisis period. On the other hand, the effect of economic growth on transportation tends to reflect no apparent change displaying the strong positive association in the entire time period. Therefore, this study proposed the policy guidelines considering the links between transportation and economic growth enduring the changes transpired in pre and post period of the global crisis.",0965-8564,Not found

Optimizing the deployment of electric vehicle charging stations using pervasive mobility data,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.002,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"With the recent advances in battery technology and the resulting decrease in the charging times, public charging stations are becoming a viable option for Electric Vehicle (EV) drivers. Concurrently, emergence and the wide-spread use of location-tracking devices in mobile phones and wearable devices has paved the way to track individual-level human movements to an unprecedented spatial and temporal grain. Motivated by these developments, we propose a novel methodology to perform data-driven optimization of EV charging station locations. We formulate the problem as a discrete optimization problem on a geographical grid, with the objective of covering the entire demand region while minimizing a measure of drivers’ total excess driving distance to reach charging stations, the related energy overhead, and the number of charging stations. Since optimally solving the problem is computationally infeasible, we present computationally efficient solutions based on the genetic algorithm. We then apply the proposed methodology to optimize EV charging stations layout in the city of Boston, starting from Call Detail Records (CDR) of one million users over the span of 4 months. The results show that the genetic algorithm provides solutions that significantly reduce drivers’ excess driving distance to charging stations, energy overhead, and the number of charging stations required compared to both a locally-optimized feasible solution and the current charging station deployment in the Boston metro area. We further investigate the robustness of the proposed methodology and show that building upon well-known regularity of aggregate human mobility patterns, the layout computed for demands based on the single day movements preserves its advantage also in later days and months. When collectively considered, the results presented in this paper indicate the potential of data-driven approaches for optimally placing public charging facilities at urban scale.",0965-8564,Not found
Mobile phone records to feed activity-based travel demand models: MATSim for studying a cordon toll policy in Barcelona,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.024,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Activity-based models appeared as an answer to the limitations of the traditional trip-based and tour-based four-stage models. The fundamental assumption of activity-based models is that travel demand is originated from people performing their daily activities. This is why they include a consistent representation of time, of the persons and households, time-dependent routing, and microsimulation of travel demand and traffic. In spite of their potential to simulate traffic demand management policies, their practical application is still limited. One of the main reasons is that these models require a huge amount of very detailed input data hard to get with surveys. However, the pervasive use of mobile devices has brought a valuable new source of data. The work presented here has a twofold objective: first, to demonstrate the capability of mobile phone records to feed activity-based transport models, and, second, to assert the advantages of using activity-based models to estimate the effects of traffic demand management policies. Activity diaries for the metropolitan area of Barcelona are reconstructed from mobile phone records. This information is then employed as input for building a transport MATSim model of the city. The model calibration and validation process proves the quality of the activity diaries obtained. The possible impacts of a cordon toll policy applied to two different areas of the city and at different times of the day are then studied. Our results show the way in which the modal share is modified in each of the considered scenarios. The possibility of evaluating the effects of the policy at both aggregated and traveller level, together with the ability of the model to capture policy impacts beyond the cordon toll area confirm the advantages of activity-based models for the evaluation of traffic demand management policies.",0965-8564,Not found
The importance of user perspective in the evolution of MaaS,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.010,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"The rapid emergence of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) into the transport sector’s lexicon has brought with it an air of expectation that suggests a future mobility revolution. This paper focusses on the user perspective and offers a deepening of socio-technical thinking about MaaS and its prospects. It first provides an examination of what is understood to date about MaaS in what is a new but rapidly evolving body of literature. This highlights the concept of MaaS as a ‘mobility system beyond the private car’ and the new centrality of a ‘mobility intermediary’ layer in that system. The paper then focuses and elaborates upon its contention that MaaS is neither new nor revolutionary but is rather an evolutionary continuation in terms of transport integration. Emerging from an era of unimodal travel information systems becoming multimodal and then integrated multimodal information services, MaaS is now about adding seamless booking, payment and ticketing to the integration offer. The paper puts forward a ‘Levels of MaaS Integration (LMI) taxonomy’ analogous to the level 0–5 SAE taxonomy for automation of road vehicles. This taxonomy, designed around the user perspective (including cognitive user effort), concerns operational, informational and transactional integration that it is suggested reflect a hierarchy of user need. From a synthesis of insights from the ‘pre-MaaS’ literature concerning choice making for travel and the role of information, a MaaS behavioural schema is provided to illustrate potential consideration and adoption of MaaS from the user perspective. In concluding, the paper considers what a user perspective reveals for the future prospects of MaaS and in particular for the mobility intermediaries.",0965-8564,https://github.com/browndw/corpus-tagger
Optimal budget allocation for risk mitigation strategy in trucking industry: An integrated approach,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.007,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Trucking industry plays a major role in the transportation of goods across different geographical locations. The operational complexities of the trucking industry lead to various risks. This study focuses on effective design and implementation of risk-mitigation strategies for the trucking industry with consideration for budget restrictions. In this paper, both subjective and objective attributes are considered in the mathematical modeling and thereby tries to capture realism in the strategic decision-making process. The results of the study provide novel insights that relate the impact of risk on the cost of mitigation. Further, the effect of three characteristics, targeted risk level (TRL), implementation cost (IC) of strategy, and the probability of risk occurrence (PO) is shown in designing and developing risk-mitigation strategies. The experimental analysis not only augments theoretical knowledge related to risk management decision-making processes but also contributes to designing and developing a risk-mitigation strategy under economic constraints. From the managerial perspective, the study demonstrates how decision-makers can benefit from an integrated approach to develop a more holistic understanding of risk-management processes. This study also provides guidelines in policy selection considering higher return on investment (ROI).

Association between innovative dockless bicycle sharing programs and adopting cycling in commuting and non-commuting trips,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.025,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"As a city-level intervention for travel mode, dockless bicycle-sharing programs provide great opportunities to promote bicycle travel in both commuting and non-commuting trips. Our study is the first to quantitatively examine whether dockless bicycle-sharing programs promote changes in travel mode in commuting and non-commuting trips, and to examine the association between change in travel mode and potential correlates. In May 2017, a cross-sectional study with a retrospective assessment was conducted to investigate travel modes before and after the launch of dockless bicycle sharing. A total of 1180 respondents provided complete self-administered questionnaires. After the advent of dockless bicycle sharing, the proportion of cyclists significantly increased from 21.9% to 30.9% in commuting and from 22.1% to 33.6% in non-commuting trips. The potential correlates of adopting cycling included age, living area, access to a public transportation stop/station, surroundings and aesthetics along the bicycle lanes, social norms, and travel mode before the advent of dockless bicycle sharing programs. Furthermore, the potential correlates of adopting cycling in travel mode differed by purpose of trips.",0965-8564,Not found
Do new bike share stations increase member use: A quasi-experimental study,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.004,121,2019-03-01,2019,3,"As the number of bike share programs across the world has grown, studies of bike programs and operations have proliferated. Most empirical studies of bike share demand have included analyses of station use while a limited number of studies have investigated member behavior. Moreover, a limitation of this research is that the most research designs have been cross-sectional and therefore unable to establish causality. To address this limitation, we employ a quasi-experimental, difference-in-difference modeling approach using a six-year panel data set of members’ bike share trips from 2010 to 2015 in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. This research design takes advantage of changes in the bike share network over time to establish treatment and control groups and test the significance of effects of changes in accessibility on the frequency of individual member’s use of bike share. Improvements in accessibility are measured as a reduction in distance to stations resulting from placement of new stations or relocation of old stations. We find a significant negative impact of distance on the frequency of use and that the effects of increasing bike share accessibility are larger in areas with denser bike share services. Specifically, members for whom access improved (i.e., distance decreased) were significantly more likely to increase the frequency of use than members for whom access remained the same. Moreover, by developing different models, we show the effects of distance are heterogeneous and vary with different built environment contexts. Members who live in areas with higher population density and a higher percentage of retail land use tended to increase their bike share use more. Our results indicate that improvements in physical accessibility may not result in practically meaningful changes in the frequency of use in all cases and imply that multi-faceted strategies for increasing use may be needed.",0965-8564,https://github.com/paezha/Accessibility-Sobi-Hamilton
How just is transportation justice theory? The issues of paternalism and production,10.1016/j.tra.2019.02.009,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The topic of justice has increasingly attracted attention from transportation scholars, and a variety of perspectives and approaches are employed to study this topic. Arguably the most elaborate and sophisticated theory is put forward by Karel Martens in his 2017 book “Transport justice”. We start with a critical reading of Karel Martens’ work which is based on the work of liberal philosophers such as Richard Dworkin. While Martens makes several telling points, we explore how debates in the justice literature apply to the case of transportation, and may question aspects of transportation justice theory. In particular we discuss the issues of (1) the paternalistic treatment of people below the accessibility poverty line, and (2) the production and planning of transportation services. Two cases are used to inform this theoretical discussion, on the one hand, the Transportation Justice movement in California, and on the other, the “basic accessibility” debate in Flanders (Belgium).",0965-8564,https://github.com/soukhova/Transportation-lit-review
Identifying commonly used and potentially unsafe transit transfers with crowdsourcing,10.1016/j.tra.2019.02.005,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Public transit is an important contributor to sustainable transportation as well as a public service that makes necessary travel possible for many. Poor transit transfers can lead to both a real and perceived reduction in convenience and safety, especially for people with disabilities. Poor transfers can expose riders to inclement weather and crime, and they can reduce transit ridership by motivating riders who have the option of driving or using paratransit to elect a more expensive and inefficient travel mode. Unfortunately, knowledge about inconvenient, missed, and unsafe transit transfers is sparse and incomplete. We show that crowdsourced public transit ridership data, which is more scalable than conducting traditional surveys, can be used to analyze transit transfers. The Tiramisu Transit app merges open transit data with information contributed by users about which trips they take. We use Tiramisu data to do origin-destination analysis and identify connecting trips to create a better understanding of where and when poor transfers are occurring in the Pittsburgh region. We merge the results with data from other open public data sources, including crime data, to create a data resource that can be used for planning and identification of locations where bus shelters and other infrastructure improvements may facilitate safer and more comfortable waits and more accessible transfers. We use generalizable methods to ensure broader value to both science and practitioners. We present a case study of the Pittsburgh region, in which we identified and characterized 338 transfers from 142 users. We found that 66.6% of transfers were within 0.4 km (0.25 mi.) and 44.1% of transfers were less than 10 min. We identified the geographical distribution of transfers and found several highly-utilized transfer locations that were not identified by the Port Authority of Allegheny County as recommended transfer points, and so might need more planning attention. We cross-referenced transfer location and wait time data with crime levels to provide additional planning insight.",0965-8564,https://github.com/CMU-RERC-APT/tiramisu3-pr
The impact of service and government-policy attributes on consumer preferences for electric vehicles in China,10.1016/j.tra.2019.02.008,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"This research focuses on the effects of different types of service attributes and context-based government policies, along with product attributes, on Chinese consumers’ adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Based on a stated choice experiment involving over 1000 respondents in different cities of China, a mixed logit (MXL) model shows that typical product attributes are consistently important for potential car buyers, but that charging service has a mixed effect, depending on the level of service provision and speed. Specifically, the availability of a home charging facility has the strongest influence on consumers’ choice to purchase EVs, and the service speed of public fast service stations is also significant. In relation to government policies, this study finds that in addition to government subsidy, free licensing policy for EVs is very attractive for consumers, compared to the lottery-based licensing for conventional petrol vehicles (PVs). We find that Chinese consumers have the highest willingness to pay for obtaining a free vehicle license for EVs (106,144 RMB on average) and being permitted to install a home charging post (91,039 RMB on average). Our findings imply the importance of considering consumers’ perceived inconvenience associated with using EVs compared to buying and using conventional PVs. Furthermore, policy makers should consider the heterogeneous preference towards EVs when designing intervention policies in the Chinese market.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of road advertising signs on driver behaviour and implications for road safety: A critical systematic review,10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.012,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Driver inattention and distraction are recognised as two of the most critical factors for road safety worldwide. While roadside advertising is often identified as a potential source of distraction, it has received less attention compared to other types of distractions such as texting or calling while driving. Therefore, this study focused on the impact of roadside advertising signs on driver behaviour and road safety. To examine this, a theory-driven systematic literature review was undertaken. In total, 90 unique documents were identified and reviewed using the Task-Capability Interface (TCI) Model to explain the potential safety impact of roadside advertising. The findings confirmed that the TCI model is a useful tool for describing the relationship between roadside advertising and driver behaviour. From this perspective, roadside advertising signs can be considered environmental clutter, which adds additional demands to the driving task. In particular, roadside advertising signs impaired eye movement patterns of drivers. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the impact of roadside advertising on driving behaviour is greatly moderated by individual differences among drivers. Of great importance was that young drivers invest more attentional resources in interacting with roadside advertising, which suggests a lower capacity to discriminate between relevant and irrelevant driving information. Based on the available evidence, however, it is not possible to definitively conclude that there is a direct relationship between the driving behaviour changes attributed to roadside advertising and road crashes. Nonetheless, while most studies remain inconclusive, there is an emerging trend in the literature suggesting that roadside advertising can increase crash risk, particularly for those signs that have the capacity to frequently change (often referred to as digital billboards). Lastly, it is important to mention that most of the empirical studies undertaken to date feature strong methodological limitations. Consequently, there is an urgent need for more research in this area, given that roadside technology and the transport system are changing rapidly.",0965-8564,Not found
When ‘push’ does not come to ‘shove’: Revisiting ‘faster is slower’ in collective egress of human crowds,10.1016/j.tra.2019.02.007,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"We revisit the assumption stating that greater levels of rush in pedestrians’ collective egress through narrow bottlenecks impedes the discharge process and makes it slower, commonly known as the ‘faster-is-slower’ phenomenon. The question is of great practical significance because it ultimately can translate into whether crowds of evacuees should be dissuaded from rushing at bottlenecks in order to minimise their evacuation time. Yet, there is a large mixture of evidence on this phenomenon in the existing literature. Here, we re-examine this assumption based on empirical tests with an aim to identify explanations for these discrepancies. Our experiments were conducted with a crowd of 114 individuals, under varying doorway widths (ranging from 60 cm to 120 cm) and under three different levels of (non-aggressive) rush/competitiveness. Under our most competitive condition, crowd density behind the exit frequently exceeded 8 ped/m2 and even reached 9 ped/m2, as may be observed in a real case of egress under severe time constraint. This elevated level of crowd pressure and competitiveness, however, never translated in slower egress even for the narrowest exit. Based on every relevant measure of movement efficiency and regardless of the door width, faster was invariably faster. Discharge rates were larger, time headways between successive exits were smaller and evacuation times were shorter when individuals pushed more intensely (compared to more orderly types of conduct). We also observed that pedestrians exited in bursts and that the burst sizes were bigger under the greater levels of rush. Overall, all measurements indicated that for moderately large crowds, as long as the competitiveness does not amount to dangerous physical pressure, and as long as individuals do not display ‘explicit’ or ‘aggressive’ forms of pushing (i.e. as long as ‘push’ does not come to ‘shove’), rushing per se does not prolong the discharge process, rather it shortens the collective discharge. A contrast between these observations and previous experiments in earlier studies indicates that the presence or absence of ‘explicit’ or ‘aggressive’ shoving in the crowd could possibly be a major determinant of faster being slower or faster. This study suggests that the ‘faster-is-slower’ term, although very common in the literature, might be an overly simplistic terminology that does not offer adequate neuance for describing a rather complex phenomenon. To determine whether faster is slower or faster, one may need to break the question down into more details and view it through context-specific influential factors such as ‘the nature of pushing’, ‘the size of the crowd behind the bottleneck’, or 'the physical characteristics of the door'. We particularly suggest that another possible factor in determining when faster is slower or faster could potentially be the ‘crowd size’, a dimension that could be systematically investigated by future studies.",0965-8564,Not found
"What is the role of weather, built-environment and accessibility geographical characteristics in influencing travelers’ experience?",10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.026,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"We examine the effect of weather, accessibility and built-environment characteristics on overall travel experience as well as the experience with the latest trips. These are factors that are often disregarded in the travel satisfaction literature even though they are believed to largely influence the first mile of the door-to-door trip. This study fills a research gap in investigating all these factors by using, amongst other, a relatively large travel satisfaction survey from years 2009 to 2015 and by focusing on urban and peri-urban geographical contexts, the city and county of Stockholm (Sweden), respectively. The ordered logit model results show that county dwellers living close to a metro station and in well linked-to-all areas report higher overall travel satisfaction evaluations. In addition, precipitation and ground covered with snow have a negative influence on travel satisfaction. Our findings indicate that built-environment characteristics exert a rather weak influence on the travel experience, especially in the peri-urban context. However, some aspects such as living in areas with medium densities, low income and with high safety perceptions around public transport stations are associated with higher satisfaction levels. In turn, areas with single land uses are found to have lower travel satisfactions. These results are important for public transport planners and designers in devising measures to prevent and mitigate the negative outcome of some weather conditions and to conceive better designed transit oriented developments.",0965-8564,Not found

An issue that has hindered progress being made to address this problem has been the availability of empirical data that reflects the changing nature of cost estimates and their difference from a project’s final account. Using a homogenous dataset provided by a public sector authority in Hong Kong, we analyse the differences between the approved budget, pre-tender estimates, contract sum and final accounts for approximately HK$115 billion (≈US$14 billion) worth of transportation projects. We demonstrate that 47% (i.e. ≈ 5 out 10) of the projects deviate from their approved budget. In particular, when we consider the difference between the approved budget and the final contract sum, we reveal there are cases of both over and under estimating. We, therefore, question the Planning Fallacy as an appropriate explanation for describing ‘how large infrastructure projects work’. The fallacy of the Planning Fallacy account revealed in this paper leads us to call upon those agencies that have actively embraced this theory to reconsider their approaches to cost estimating and risk analysis used to deliver their transportation infrastructure to ensure taxpayers are provided with better value for money.",0965-8564,Not found

Using data from structured interviews with 710 respondents in Chengdu, China, we aim to explore whether e-shopping for four types of goods (clothes and shoes, electronics, food and drink, and cosmetics) replaces shopping trips. In addition, regression models are constructed to demonstrate the determinants of e-shopping and shopping travel behaviors. The results suggest that consumers’ e-shopping and shopping travel behaviors are significantly determined by sociodemographics, internet experience, car ownership, and location factors. E-shopping has a substitution effect on the frequency of shopping trips. It is further suggested that e-shopping could be regarded as a possible solution for urban congestion.

Does context matter? A comparative study modelling autonomous vehicle impact on travel behaviour for Germany and the USA,10.1016/j.tra.2018.03.033,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"This paper, for the first time, presents comparable projections of travel behaviour impacts of the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into the private car fleet for two countries, namely the USA and Germany. The focus is on fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) which allow drivers to engage in other activities enroute. Two 2035 scenarios – a trend scenario and an extreme scenario – are presented for both study countries. For these projections, we combine a vehicle technology diffusion model and an aspatial travel demand model. Factors that influence AV impact in the behavioural model are mainly new automobile user groups, e.g. travellers with mobility impairments, and altered generalized costs of travel, e.g. due to a lower value of travel time savings for car travel. The results indicate that AV penetrations rates might be higher in Germany (10% or 38% respectively) than in the USA (8% or 29% respectively) due to a higher share of luxury cars and quicker fleet turnover. On the contrary, the increase of vehicle mileage induced by AVs is not higher in Germany (+2.4% or +8.6% respectively) than in the USA (+3.4% or +8.6% respectively). This is mainly due to the lack of mode alternatives and lower fuel costs resulting in a higher share of travel times among the total generalized costs of travel in the USA. These results clearly indicate that context factors shaped by national policy will influence AV adoption and impact on travel demand changes. Based on these results the paper draws policy recommendations which will help to harness the advantages of AVs while avoiding their negative consequences.",0965-8564,Not found

The paper combines a systematic review of the literature, a quantitative online survey, and qualitative interviews with representatives from urban transport planning authorities in Germany. Four concrete ‘use-cases’ were applied to structure the survey. Results show that respondents are rather skeptical about the compatibility of AV with existing transport and urban planning objectives, above all to strengthen non-motorized transportation and to promote public transportation. Particularly, automating private motorized travel appears not to match municipal planning perspectives. On the contrary, transport planners think that shared autonomous vehicles as a complement to public transport systems are more appropriate to support urban development strategies. Their most prominent concern with respect to AV is the expectation that car travel will increase with AV, propagating problems like congestion and negative environmental effects. However, survey respondents expect that effects differ quite strongly depending on how AV will occur. As a lesson, the study suggests that different AV use-cases should receive specific attention to explore their potentials and challenges. The study likewise suggests to, given the discrepancy between the objectives of urban transport planning and federal government‘s policy focus, consider consolidating the communal strategic positions on research and development priorities. The results indicate a demand for studies that demonstrate how AV can respond to more fundamental challenges and goals that city planner’s face. Given the wide range of potential implications, the study suggests to broaden the debate from its present primary focus on the transport planning domain to city planning and development.",0965-8564,Not found
It takes two to Tango: Automated vehicles and human beings do the dance of driving – Four social considerations for policy,10.1016/j.tra.2018.03.005,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Automated vehicle (AV) policy development and assessment is a difficult and complicated process. Today’s road and vehicle policies are the product of a hundred years of lessons learned. They generally address five areas: safety, efficiency, mobility, convenience, and impact on the environment. Now the prospect-turned-reality of automated vehicles entering public roadways has opened up a number of new policy-related questions. Is it enough to simply modify current road and vehicle policies or will new policies need to be developed addressing much broader aspects of the transportation system? How can these policies be developed to accommodate technologies that either do not yet exist or are only now being tested on the road in constrained environments? Perhaps most importantly, how can policy influence technological design to safely operate with other road users and can we look ahead to have a better view of potential unintended consequences? This paper provides policymakers with research-based information as they address these and other questions. A metaphor is used where two people on the dancefloor both know a complicated dance. They play off real-time feedback including emotions, tempo, and others on the floor to plan, execute, and modify their moves to complete the performance. It provides insight to some of the social considerations that should be considered as future AV policy is developed. Insights into the direction of current policy are identified and the relationship to the social nature of AV users and non-users are provided. A use case scenario of a driverless shuttle vehicle operating in a campus-type setting is used to elucidate important considerations and underscore the dynamic nature of the social transportation system. Both simulation and field testing provide insight into the problems that affect both users and non-users. Issues are identified that may not yet have been considered by policymakers. An imagined future where AVs seamlessly integrate into our existing transportation system and current driving culture may be erroneous. Considerations for policy include standardizing situations, mechanisms for communication with other road users, and passenger mediation for other road user communication with AVs.",0965-8564,Not found
Quantifying autonomous vehicles national fuel consumption impacts: A data-rich approach,10.1016/j.tra.2017.10.012,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Autonomous vehicles are drawing significant attention from governments, manufacturers and consumers. Experts predict them to be the primary means of transportation by the middle of this century. Recent literature shows that vehicle automation has the potential to alter traffic patterns, vehicle ownership, and land use, which may affect fuel consumption from the transportation sector. In this paper, we developed a data-rich analytical framework to quantify system-wide fuel impacts of automation in the United States by integrating (1) a dynamic vehicle sales, stock, and usage model, (2) an historical transportation network-level vehicle miles traveled (VMT)/vehicle activity database, and (3) estimates of automation’s impacts on fuel efficiency and travel demand. The vehicle model considers dynamics in vehicle fleet turnover and fuel efficiency improvements of conventional and advanced vehicle fleet. The network activity database contains VMT, free-flow speeds, and historical speeds of road links that can help us accurately identify fuel-savings opportunities of automation. Based on the model setup and assumptions, we found that the impacts of automation on fuel consumption are quite wide-ranging—with the potential to reduce fuel consumption by 45% in our “Optimistic” case or increase it by 30% in our “Pessimistic” case. Second, implementing automation on urban roads could potentially result in larger fuel savings compared with highway automation because of the driving features of urban roads. Through scenario analysis, we showed that the proposed framework can be used for refined assessments as better data on vehicle-level fuel efficiency and travel demand impacts of automation become available.",0965-8564,Not found
Regulatory challenges for road vehicle automation: Lessons from the California experience,10.1016/j.tra.2017.10.006,122,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The development of automated driving systems presents a special challenge to the existing regulatory regimes for road vehicles. Automated driving systems shift the responsibility for roadway and traffic monitoring, decision making, and vehicle control from the driver to the automated driving system, which will necessitate a shift of the responsibility for traffic law violations and crashes from the individual driver toward the manufacturers of the automated driving systems. However, the opportunities for automated driving systems to improve transportation system performance and safety are great, and rapid innovation needs to be balanced against the risks to public safety from poorly engineered or hastily released systems competing for first-on-the-market status. Furthermore, in the absence of clearly defined standards and testing procedures, it is not yet clear how safety can be certified by the developer, a regulatory agency, or a third party. This paper describes California’s pioneering efforts to grapple with these challenges after its legislature passed a law requiring the development of regulations to govern the testing and operation of automated vehicles on public roads, and it provides recommendations regarding what should and should not be incorporated into such regulations.",0965-8564,Not found

Increasing cycling for transportation in Canadian communities: Understanding what works,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.010,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"This article looks at the different factors that contributed to an increase in utilitarian cycling between 1996 and 2015 in ten communities of various sizes and locations across Canada. Interviews with engineers, planners, activists, politicians and academics were conducted to assess which factors were more important in changing cycling practice in ten case studies areas that witnessed very large increases in their cycling commuting mode shares between the censuses of 1996 and 2011. The results show that although the story varies from case to case, some factors had more impact on cycling behaviour than others. Factors beyond the control of local actors, such as cultural, demographic and economic changes, have contributed significantly to an increase in utilitarian cycling in all case studies. In addition to these macro-trends, locally adopted measures have also been effective: the development of pro-cycling policies and programs, as well as the expansion of cycling infrastructure, seem to have heavily influenced cycling in several communities. In some case study areas, the activities and advocacy of cycling groups have been very influential. In a few cases, such as two small mountain communities, a specific event triggered the increase in cycling in the area. More often, however, it was a combination of government-controlled factors and larger macro-trends that created an environment favourable to cycling for transportation in the studied municipalities.",0965-8564,https://github.com/paezha/Correlates-of-Cycling-Flows-Route-Types
Affective experiences of built environments and the promotion of urban walking,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.006,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"According to psychological theories of environmental affect, the physical environment moderates the walking experience and its psychological wellbeing benefits. The present paper further demonstrates that affective experiences also influence intentions to walk. A study to explore the influence of affective experiences of walking on walking intentions is reported. A sample of adults working or studying in Bristol, UK (n = 384) participated in an experiment involving virtual exposure to one of five environments, with evaluations of their affective experience and of intentions to walk in the setting. A subsample (n = 14) then took part in photo-elicited semi-structured interviews. Multiple regression analyses showed that affective experiences of walking influenced walking intentions. Interview analyses highlighted the role of traffic, city busyness, and poor aesthetics. This is the first empirical study that examines the walking experience and related walking intentions from the pedestrian perspective employing theories of environmental affect. The findings indicate that safety, comfort, and moderate sensory stimulation are crucial elements for the walking experience. Following this, a strategy to promote active mobility in the built environment can be constructed around safety, comfort, and moderate sensory stimulation by targeting the micro elements that prevent them.",0965-8564,Not found
Neighbourhood perceptions and older adults’ wellbeing: Does walking explain the relationship in deprived urban communities?,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.008,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"There is increased awareness of the role of the urban landscape in promoting walking to counter the negative health and wellbeing impacts of age-related immobility. Consideration of neighbourhood design is particularly relevant in the context of local urban regeneration projects, which are designed to have positive health and wellbeing outcomes. However, few studies explicitly investigate how the environment influences walking and wellbeing for older adults living in deprived urban areas. There are strong conceptual and empirical links between walking, the urban environment and mental wellbeing. Many studies have separately demonstrated pairwise associations between all three components. In this paper we address these three concepts empirically, using structural equation modelling to explore walking as a mediator between the perceived social and built environments and mental wellbeing for older adults in deprived urban areas. We found direct and indirect relationships between neighbourhood perceptions and wellbeing. Walking partially mediates relationships between social contact, neighbourhood quality, local amenity use, safety and mental wellbeing. Although neighbourhood problems and the quality of local services and amenities are associated with mental wellbeing, walking is not an explanatory pathway in our model. The relationship between walking and wellbeing is weaker than expected. While promoting walking as a means of achieving positive mental wellbeing among older adults is important for “active ageing”, it is also necessary to consider the context in which this takes place, recognising that walking is not the only potential causal pathway between environment and wellbeing. Where walking is relied upon for transport, the wellbeing implications may be more complex. Given the strong associations between car ownership and wellbeing, future research should explore whether mobility and accessibility, rather than walking itself, is more important for older adults’ wellbeing.",0965-8564,Not found
Where does active travel fit within local community narratives of mobility space and place?,10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.023,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Encouraging sustainable mobility patterns is at the forefront of policymaking at all scales of governance as the collective consciousness surrounding climate change continues to expand. Not every community, however, possesses the necessary economic or socio-cultural capital to encourage modal shifts away from private motorized vehicles towards active modes. The current literature on ‘soft’ policy emphasizes the importance of tailoring behavior change campaigns to individual or geographic context. Yet, there is a lack of insight and appropriate tools to promote active mobility and overcome transport disadvantage from the local community perspective. The current study investigates the promotion of walking and cycling adoption using a series of focus groups with local residents in two geographic communities, namely Chicago’s (1) Humboldt Park neighborhood and (2) suburb of Evanston. The research centers on analysis of the verbal transcripts. The approach combines traditional qualitative discourse analysis with quantitative text-mining tools, namely topic modeling and sentiment analysis. The aim of the analysis is to uncover the local mobility culture, embedded norms and values associated with acceptance of active travel modes in different communities. The analysis uncovers that underserved populations within diverse communities view active mobility simultaneously as a necessity and as a symbol of privilege that is sometimes at odds with the local culture. Thereby, this research expands on the walking and cycling literature by providing novel insights regarding the perceived benefits of, and barriers to, equitable promotion of these modes. The mixed methods approach to analyzing community member discourses is translated into policy findings that are either tailored to local context or broadly applicable to curbing automobile dominance. Overall, residents of both Humboldt Park and Evanston envision a society in which multimodalism replaces car-centrism, but differences in the local physical and social environments would and should influence the manner in which overarching policy objectives are met.",0965-8564,Not found

Encompassing both priorities, electric-bicycles have become a popular mode of transportation in some parts of the world. While multiple studies have suggested older adult populations may be most likely to benefit from e-bike technology, few studies have exclusively focused on this demographic to identify the factors that may promote or inhibit e-bike adoption amongst this group. This study explores the potential for e-bikes to support independent mobility and active aging among the older adult population in Canada’s auto-dependent context. Guided by a conceptual framework for older adult mobility, this study used qualitative methods to gather perceptual and experiential data from 17 community stakeholders and 37 older adults in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario. The findings highlight the importance of cycling life histories, social connection and physical limitations to adopting cycling later in life. Specific individual and structural factors were discussed in relation to e-bike adoption including facilitators such as increased convenience, reduced physical exertion, reduced reliance on a vehicle and fun. Barriers included cycling infrastructure and road safety, regulation, and stigmatization barriers. E-bikes as a more convenient and supportive mode of transit for older adults is discussed alongside the importance of e-bikes as a replacement for traditional bicycles in a subset of this population.",0965-8564,Not found
"Associations between individual characteristics, availability of bicycle infrastructure, and city-wide safety perceptions of bicycling: A cross-sectional survey of bicyclists in 6 Canadian and U.S. cities",10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.024,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Safety concerns are a primary deterrent to bicycling. Bicycle infrastructure is both preferred and safer for bicycling. In this paper, we examine the association between availability of bicycle infrastructure and perceptions of bicycling safety amongst over 3000 bicyclists living in six large Canadian and US cities. In three repeat cross-sectional surveys (2012, 2013 and 2014), adults living in Boston, Chicago, New York, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver were surveyed about their bicycling habits, safety perceptions, and demographic characteristics as part of the International Bikeshare Impacts on Cycling and Collisions Study (n = 16,864). Participants were assigned a measure for the availability of bicycle infrastructure (a component of Bike Score® called Bike Lane Score, range 0–100) based on their residential postal code. We used weighted multinomial regression models to examine associations between perceived bicycling safety and the availability of bicycle infrastructure, accounting for sociodemographic characteristics, amongst those who report bicycling in the past month (n = 3446; weighted n = 3493). Overall, 57.9% perceived bicycling in their city as safe, 15.1% as neutral, and 27.0% as dangerous. Our model indicates that, within cities, bicyclists with greater bicycle infrastructure availability had improved odds of perceiving bicycling as safe. Specifically, a 10-unit increase in Bike Lane Score was associated with 6% higher odds of a bicyclist perceiving the safety of bicycling as safe compared to neutral. Bicyclists who are male, younger, lower income, have young children, have a high-school education, and bicycle more frequently are predicted to be more likely to perceive bicycling in their city to be safe. These results suggest that increasing the availability of bicycle facilities by expanding bicycling networks may result in increases in perceptions of bicycling safety for existing bicyclists, but also that individual characteristics play a substantial role in bicycling safety perceptions.",0965-8564,https://github.com/paezha/Correlates-of-Cycling-Flows-Route-Types
Active travel as stable source of physical activity for one third of German adults: Evidence from longitudinal data,10.1016/j.tra.2018.09.022,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Walking and cycling—active travel—can help adults achieve the World Health Organization’s recommended 150+ min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week. Based on a nationally representative panel-survey of daily travel in Germany, this study assesses weekly minutes of active travel by adult respondents participating in a weeklong survey in two consecutive years. The paper first identifies person-level covariates for achieving 150+ min of active travel during a week in year 1 of panel participation. The analysis then compares the patterns of individuals falling into four groups of active travel over the two survey years: ‘high maintainers’ who achieved 150+ min in both year 1 and year 2; ‘low maintainers’ who did not achieve 150+ min in neither year 1 nor year 2; ‘adopters’ who did not achieve 150+ min in year 1, but did so in year 2; and ‘relapsers’ who achieved 150+ min in year 1, but not in year 2. About half (48%) of respondents achieved 150+ min of active travel per week in their first year of panel participation. Of those, about three-quarters were ‘high maintainers’ with 150+ min of active travel in both years. Logistic regressions showed that ‘high maintainers’ were more likely to be 30 years or older, not employed, have a monthly public transport pass, live within 2 km of a shopping destination, and less likely to own cars. Transport and land-use policies can help influence several of these factors. Compared to ‘low maintainers,’ policy interventions to increase population shares achieving health-enhancing levels of physical activity from active travel may be most promising when targeting ‘adopters’ and ‘relapsers.’ These groups are more similar to the ‘high maintainers,’ with at least one year reporting of health-enhancing physical activity from active travel—compared to the ‘low maintainers.’",0965-8564,Not found
Do metro interruptions increase the demand for public rental bicycles?

One of the ways through which cities promote cycling is by providing a public bicycle system (PBS) with electronic docking stations. This paper studies demand for public rental bicycles following local and temporary metro interruptions in Paris. I construct a unique data set by linking metro interruptions announced in Twitter communication by the Parisian metro operator to usage data on the Vélib’ PBS. I find that, as a direct consequence of a metro interruption, the consumption of bicycles within 100 m of metro stations increases by 0.72 bicycles per hour per docking station on average, and with 1.54 bicycles per hour per docking station during the first 20 min; an increase of approximately 11% and 22% respectively. Due to their effects on demand, metro interruptions increase the probability of empty stocks at docking stations with 15%. The findings highlight that cycling is a local net substitute for metro service, and that public rental bicycles can alleviate time losses stemming from interruptions in public transport.",0965-8564,Not found

However, these user benefits could be undervalued using traditional economic appraisal, in which speed increases or travel time savings are highly valued. This paper explores the use of the logsum measure of consumer surplus for valuing the user benefits of new active transport infrastructure, using new separated cycleways in Sydney (Australia) as a case study. The results suggest the value of user benefits can be significant – of a similar order of magnitude to the estimated value of the public health benefits – and it becomes more pronounced as cycleways are integrated into a connected network. The method could be used to inform transportation investment policy decisions in other jurisdictions, where suitable travel survey data are available.",0965-8564,Not found

Motivations to cycle to work refer to well-being (both physical and mental), independence and civic engagement. Four types of cyclist are identified according to their motivations: active, civic, independent and enthusiast. Barriers relate to weather conditions, safety, logistical constraints and comfort. A cycling policy could integrate these results and focus on movement (a network of direct and well-maintained routes), experience (safe and pleasant routes designed for all types of cyclist) and meanings (by promoting cycling to various audiences and assessing the legitimacy of cycling as a fully-fledged means of transportation).",0965-8564,Not found
Psychosocial and environmental correlates of cycling for transportation in Brussels,10.1016/j.tra.2018.09.005,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"This study examines which psychosocial and environmental factors are associated with cycling in the Brussels Capital Region (BCR) and whether these associations differ between those who never cycle for transport purposes (Non-cyclists) and those who used the bicycle at least once a week in the previous 6 months (Cyclists). Adults (18–65 year; N = 503; 47% women) living and/or working in the BCR completed an online questionnaire assessing socio-demographic, general transport, psychosocial and environmental variables. Psychosocial factors were significantly different (p < 0.001) between Cyclists and Non-cyclists, with Cyclists having a higher score for Modelling, Social support and perceiving more Benefits. The physical environmental factors were not significantly different between the Cyclists and Non-cyclists. Cyclists indicate more often that cycling is unpleasant because of the exhaust fumes and pressure from motorized traffic. The likelihood of a woman being a Cyclist is 1.61 times smaller compared to a man being a Cyclist. The influence of individual and social factors seems to be more predictive in distinguishing between Cyclists and Non-cyclists.",0965-8564,Not found

The aim of this study is to understand how social factors and the physical environment influence adolescent active travel in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). A survey in HCMC targeting adolescents aged 11–16 (n = 525) across nine districts around the city centre was conducted. We adapted a comprehensive conceptual framework of active travel behaviour in the context of data availability and the study area. We also included variables pertaining weather, traffic safety, street vendors and road accident experiences, which are more relevant in powered two-wheeler (PTW) traffic saturated, tropical cities in a South East Asian setting. The results show positive association between favourable built environments (obstruction free pathways, food attractions and tree cover), social interactions (peer groups, parents and neighbourhoods) and negative association with traffic, air pollution and prior accident experiences.

Assessing the potential for carbon emissions savings from replacing short car trips with walking and cycling using a mixed GPS-travel diary approach,10.1016/j.tra.2018.08.022,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"There is a growing recognition of the role that walking and cycling can make in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by substituting motorized travel, particularly on short trips. However, there is a lack of evidence at the micro level on the realistic, empirically derived potential of walking and cycling to displace motorized travel and thus reduce GHG emissions. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential for GHG emissions savings from replacing short car trips with walking and cycling and the extent to which high quality infrastructure for walking and cycling may influence day-to-day travel decisions, change the spatial and temporal nature of local journeys and impact on overall GHG emissions from motorised travel. To achieve this aim this study conducted an in-depth observational study of a purposively selected cohort of 50 residents in Cardiff, Wales. Using a mixed-method approach detailed quantitative and qualitative data were collected for each participant using personal Global Position System (GPS) devices, 7-day travel diaries and contextual interviews over two seasonally matching 7-day time periods in 2011 and 2012. GHG emissions for motorized travel modes were derived using journey distance, vehicle technology details and average speeds obtained from the GPS data. The spatial and contextual data provided new insights into the complexities of walking behaviour and factors influencing cycling for everyday travel or recreation, including route choice decisions, activity destinations and the role of the new infrastructure to enable change. We found significant potential of active travel to substitute short car trips, with sizeable impacts on carbon emissions from personal travel. Half of all car trips were less than 3 miles long. Taking into account individual travel patterns and constraints, walking or cycling could realistically substitute for 41% of short car trips, saving nearly 5% of CO2e emissions from car travel. This was on top of 5% of ‘avoided’ emissions from cars due to existing walking and cycling. The evolving high quality walking and cycling infrastructure in the case study area was unlikely to promote a significant reduction in carbon emissions from (displaced) car journeys on its own. The study contributes to the debate on how to achieve stringent low carbon targets in urban transport. The combination of methods for data collection developed and employed in this study also helps to inform future research on the wider environmental impacts of active travel, including ‘co-benefits’ of improved air quality, reduced noise and reduced fossil fuel use.",0965-8564,Not found
Cycling or walking? Determinants of mode choice in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.tra.2018.08.023,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Interest into active modes (i.e. walking and cycling) has increased significantly over the past decades, with governments worldwide ultimately aiming for a modal shift towards active modes. To devise policies that promote this goal, understanding the determinants that influence the choice for an active mode is essential. The Netherlands is country with a large and demographically diverse active mode user population, mature and complete active mode infrastructure, and safe environment. Mode choice research from the Netherlands enables a comparison on relevant determinants with countries that have a low active mode share. Furthermore, it can provide quantitative input for policies aiming at an active mode shift. This paper estimates a mode choice model focusing on active modes, while including a more comprehensive set of modes (i.e. walking, cycling, public transport and car). Based on data from the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN) in combination with an additional survey focused on active modes (coined PAW-AM), this study estimates which determinants influence mode choice. The determinants can be categorized as individual characteristics, household characteristics, season and weather characteristics, trip characteristics, built environment, and work conditions. The results show that all categories of determinants influence both walking and cycling. However, the choice for cycling or walking is affected by different determinants and to a different extent. In addition, no active mode nest was found in the model estimation. Cycling and walking should thus be regarded as two distinguished alternatives. Furthermore, the results show that active mode use is most sensitive to changes in the trip characteristics and the built environment.",0965-8564,Not found

Bicycle skills training programs have been implemented in several countries, cities, and schools, but few evaluations measure changes in bicycling. We conducted a scoping review to identify and describe evidence of changes in bicycling frequency associated with bicycle skills training. We also describe and compare the theoretical basis, context, and training content of bicycle skills trainings that might be associated with changes in bicycling. Methods We searched six electronic databases, grey literature websites, Google Scholar, and citations in relevant articles for pre- and post-test studies of bicycle skill training interventions which measured bicycling frequency in children or adults. We assessed the theory, context, and content of the bicycle skills training interventions using pre-defined concepts and a behaviour change technique taxonomy. Results We found 12 studies. Six studies assessed programs for adult populations, of which five reported increases in overall bicycling and three reported increases in bicycling to work. Six studies assessed programs for children, of which five reported increases in overall bicycling and three reported increases in bicycling to school. Information about the statistical significance of these results was sometimes missing. Studies described intervention content adequately, but poorly reported details about intervention theory and context. No associations were found between intervention content and changes in bicycling frequency. Conclusions Bicycle skills training increases participants’ bicycling, but evidence is heterogeneous among a small number of studies. Sparse reporting limited our ability to detect associations between changes in bicycling frequency and the training theory, context, or content. Future studies should strive to report details on theory, context, and content to help assess effectiveness and generalizability.",0965-8564,Not found

Understanding the determinants of teen active travel to school is important given that teenage travel may have implications for the formation of habits that carry over to adulthood. We present evidence linking travel to school with bicycling attitudes and with road environments on plausible paths to school using data from a large cross-sectional survey of students at three high schools in Northern California. Results suggest that the relationship between attitudes and bicycling are stronger than the relationship between road environments and bicycling. Students’ perceived social pressure to bicycle has a particularly strong association with bicycling. Hypothetical intervention scenarios suggest that students would walk and bicycle to school at substantially greater rates if they had better road environments for walking and bicycling, shorter distances to school, and more positive bicycling attitudes.",0965-8564,Not found
Impacts of an active travel intervention with a cycling focus in a suburban context: One-year findings from an evaluation of London's in-progress mini-Hollands programme,10.1016/j.tra.2018.05.018,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Background More evidence is needed on the impacts of building infrastructure for walking and cycling. A knowledge gap and an implementation gap have been mutually reinforcing. This paper reports on a longitudinal study examining the impacts of the still in progress ‘mini-Hollands programme’, which seeks to transform local environments for walking and cycling, in three Outer London boroughs. Compared to Inner London, Outer London has low levels of cycling and low levels of walking, and is relatively car dependent. Methods We conducted a longitudinal study of 1712 individuals sampled from households in mini-Holland boroughs (intervention sample) and from non mini-Holland Outer London boroughs (control sample). The intervention sample was further divided, a priori, into those living in “high-dose neighbourhoods”, where substantial changes to the local walking and cycling infrastructure had been implemented, versus “low-dose neighbourhoods” where such improvements had not (yet) been made. At both baseline (2016) and one-year follow-up (2017), we administered an online survey of travel behaviour and attitudes to transport and the local environment. Results One year’s worth of interventions was associated with an increase in active travel among those living in areas defined as ‘high-dose’ neighbourhoods. Specifically, those in high-dose areas were 24% more likely to have done any past-week cycling at follow-up, compared to those living in non mini-Holland areas (95% CI, 2% to 52%). The mid-point estimate for increase in active travel (walking plus cycling) time for the same group was an additional 41.0 min (95% CI 7.0, 75.0 min). Positive changes in views about local environments were recorded in intervention areas, driven by a perceived improvement in cycling-related items. Controversy related to the interventions is expressed in a growth in perceptions that ‘too much’ money is spent on cycling in intervention areas. However, intervention areas also saw a reduction in perceptions that ‘too little’ money is spent (the latter view being common both at baseline and Wave 1 in control areas). Conclusion Overall, the findings here suggest that programme interventions, while controversial, are having a measurable and early impact on active travel behaviour and perceptions of the local cycling environment.",0965-8564,https://github.com/browndw/corpus-tagger
Do bicycling experiences and exposure influence bicycling skills and attitudes? Evidence from a bicycle-friendly university,10.1016/j.tra.2018.05.017,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Life changes are often associated with changes in travel behavior, due to a break in habitual travel cues and the introduction of a novel travel context. Universities provide a particularly appropriate setting to examine how these life changes can bring about changes in travel attitudes, norms, and skills – which together form a psychological construct called “motility” that describes the capability for travel. In this study, I pool data from seven years of the University of California, Davis’ annual campus travel survey to create a longitudinal panel, and use a retrospective survey to collect the bicycling behaviors, attitudes, and skills of undergraduates every year since they graduated from high school. I find that, on average, UCD undergraduates’ pro-bicycling attitudes decrease slightly over time while bicycling skills increase substantially throughout college. I then use the retrospective panel data to estimate a statistical model to analyze the influence of bicycling exposure and experiences on skills and attitudes. I find that riding a bicycle at any point during college increases both pro-bicycling attitudes and bicycling skills, while exposure to high levels of bicycling appears not to influence attitudes or skills. This study provides confirmatory evidence for the motility approach and suggests possible policy avenues, such as incentivizing short-term bicycle use in order to shift perceptions and attitudes about bicycling, with the intent of fostering a positive feedback cycle between greater bicycling attitudes and skills and increased bicycle use.",0965-8564,Not found
An examination of children's school travel: A focus on active travel and parental effects,10.1016/j.tra.2018.05.023,123,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Concerns regarding children’s health and physical activity levels have prompted a growing interest in understanding the school mode choice decision. Walking and biking to school can help school-age children achieve recommended daily physical activity levels. The growing literature in this area has provided valuable insights but has often failed to adequately consider the influence of parents on children’s decision making. This study aims to provide additional insights by examining the school mode choice with a focus on active travel and the role of parental effects. A multinomial logit model was estimated for children’s school mode choice using the 2009 National Household Travel Survey with the add-on sample for Texas. A comprehensive set of variables, including individual and household characteristics, built and travel environment measures, and parental characteristics and attitudes, were found to be influential on the decision of active travel to school. Although the focus of this study is on children’s school mode, a model examining parent’s active travel was also estimated to provide a picture of parents and their own active travel decisions through a Poisson count regression model for the parents’ non-motorized travel frequency (weekly). Findings strongly suggested that mothers’ concerns regarding traffic conditions in the neighborhood can discourage children’s active mode use. In contrast, fathers’ work flexibility seemed to facilitate more non-motorized school travel. Similarly, many factors were important in determining non-motorized trip frequency. A flexible work environment, particularly for the mothers, was observed to increase the overall trip frequency of parents. The results from this study corroborate the findings from several earlier studies while also indicating new factors not previously identified. The work done in this study can be extended in several directions. One particularly interesting avenue of future research is to model the two decisions in a joint model to identify the causal direction while accounting for unobserved factors.",0965-8564,Not found

The present analysis is based on panel data covering the period from 2011 to 2017 in Spain, where several schemes were intermittently implemented. Using duration models, we specify the scrappage rate as a function of car age and other factors related to business cycle and transportation sector. On the base of this specification, we control for tax incentives. Our results confirm the relevant impact of car age and scrappage schemes on the scrappage rate and, consequently, on fleet age distribution. Therefore, cash for clunkers schemes may be of interest to policymakers as part of a strategy to reduce pollution and road accidents, regardless of the stage of the business cycle.",0965-8564,Not found
Exploring parental perceptions about school travel and walking school buses: A thematic analysis approach,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.011,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Establishing a less car-oriented mobility ethos through initiatives targeting, among others, children’s travel to school could be a key for unlocking the potential for a more sustainable future. A Walking School Bus (WSB) is a relatively new and scarcely evaluated commuting mechanism that in theory provides a creative scheme capable of inspiring voluntary travel behaviour change for children and parents. Through a series of in-depth focus group sessions that were conducted in Bradford, UK this article explores the perceptions of parents that are ultimately the decision-makers about how their children go to school. This work improves the understanding of the different challenges and opportunities underpinning travel to school, in general, and WSBs, in particular, by identifying and discussing six thematic areas of critical importance that explain the decision-making behind potential WSB uptake. These are namely: logistics, safety, trust, health and wellbeing, emotional needs and educational opportunities. Finally, the paper provides policy recommendations about how WSB initiatives can become more effective and attractive mobility tools for local communities.",0965-8564,https://github.com/browndw/corpus-tagger
A longitudinal analysis of the effectiveness of California's ban on cellphone use while driving,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.016,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Cellphone use while driving is an increasingly serious threat for traffic safety and is prohibited in many jurisdictions. In California, the use of handheld cellphones while driving has been prohibited since July 1, 2008. Using interrupted time series analysis, this study explores the effectiveness of the ban by specifically analyzing the crashes caused by cellphone usage in California from 2002 to 2014. These crashes were thought to be able to reflect the role of the ban more accurately than total crashes. The ban was found effective in reducing the cellphone usage-caused crashes in terms of both crash frequency and crash proportion. The study also confirms that crashes caused by cellphone use produce more severe outcomes than other crashes. These findings show that the ban on handheld cellphone use while driving plays an important role for improving traffic safety in California. In addition, it is found that the ban motivates drivers to switch from handheld cellphones to hands-free cellphones, but in terms of crash severity, hands-free cellphone usage and handheld cellphone usage do not show significant differences. These findings support a complete ban on cellphone use while driving--not just a prohibition of handheld cellphone use. The study results are expected to provide new insights for future policy-making related to cellphone use while driving.",0965-8564,Not found
Pure versus hybrid competitive strategies in the airport industry,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.015,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"The advent of low-cost carriers has dramatically changed the competitive landscape of the airport industry and diminished the monopoly power that airports once enjoyed. Today, major airports compete directly with periphery airports, which are becoming the apparent choice of low-cost carriers. In fact, contracting with low-cost airlines has become a determinant factor in airport strategies, and airports now face a strategic decision to position themselves towards either low-cost or full-service (legacy) airline, or both. This paper examines the impact of these competitive strategies on airport financial performance. Building on the strategic purity premise, we hypothesise that being either a low-cost-oriented or legacy-oriented airport (pursuing a pure strategy) is associated with superior financial performance, in comparison with combining the two (a hybrid strategy). Moreover, the benefit of pure strategies increases with the intensity of competition among nearby airports. The paper supports these hypotheses with findings drawn from the U.S. airport industry.",0965-8564,Not found
Understanding bike sharing use over time by employing extended technology continuance theory,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.013,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"The wide acceptance of bike sharing services depends on the consumers’ continuing use of bike sharing services. Facilitating users’ continuance intentions and retaining consumers are important to bike sharing service providers and governments. Following extended technology continuance theory and incorporating perceived risk, we aim to identify factors that affect bike sharing services’ continuance intentions in this study. We use a questionnaire survey involving 559 respondents to conduct data analysis with structural equation modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the extended technology continuance theory could provide a strong rationale in the investigation of continuance intention to adopt bike sharing services. Perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and attitude are positively associated with continuance intention. Perceived usefulness also positively impacts satisfaction and attitude. Perceived risk tends to be negatively related to satisfaction. Additionally, confirmation can positively impact perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Perceived ease of use is positively associated with perceived usefulness and attitude.",0965-8564,Not found
"Organisation and performance of public transport: A systematic cross-case comparison of metropolitan areas in Europe, Australia, and Canada",10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.008,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"The paper investigates how the interplay between six organisational elements of public transport systems (conditions) – i.e. integration of planning responsibilities within an authority at the regional/metropolitan level; land-use and transport integration; long-term metropolitan public transport planning; agency over funding; fare integration, and allocation of risks between government and operators - influence two key performance indicators (outcomes) – modal split and cost-recovery. The study focuses on selected metropolitan areas in Europe, Australia, and Canada, and employs Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). QCA can handle multiple explanatory conditions in combination, framing the relationship between conditions and studied outcomes in terms of necessity and sufficiency. The paper reveals three alternative combinations of organisational elements that are sufficient for achieving each outcome, underscoring that modal split and cost-recovery depend on the combined effects of multiple conditions (conjunctural causality), and that different paths can lead to similar results (equifinality). Furthermore, even though both outcomes are linked to higher usage of public transport, findings suggest that each of them might require decision-makers to give attention to different elements. Higher modal split is closely linked to both integration between land-use and transport, and the integration of planning responsibilities within an authority at the regional/metropolitan level. Higher cost-recovery, in turn, requires focus on the way agency over funding and risk allocation strategies shape incentives for savings and/or revenue generation.",0965-8564,Not found
Alternative-fuel-vehicle policy interactions increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.003,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"The transportation sector is currently the largest contributor of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States, and light-duty vehicles produce the majority of transportation emissions. Federal standards for fleet-averaged vehicle GHG emission rates and their corresponding corporate average fuel economy standards cap GHG emissions of the US light-duty vehicle fleet. In addition, two key policies aim to encourage a future fleet transition to alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) technologies: (1) incentives that treat AFVs favorably in the federal GHG standard, and (2) state zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) policy, which mandates AFV sales in some states. While each of these AFV policies can encourage AFV adoption, we show that net GHG emissions increase when both policies are present simultaneously. Specifically, we estimate changes in life cycle GHG emissions and gasoline consumption, relative to a pure federal fleet GHG standard (without AFV incentives or mandates), resulting from the introduction of (1) AFV incentives in federal fleet GHG policy, (2) state ZEV mandates, and (3) the combination of the two. We find that under fairly general conditions the combined AFV policies produce higher GHG emissions than either policy alone. This result is a consequence of state mandates increasing AFV sales in the presence of federal incentives that relax the fleet GHG standard when AFVs are sold. Using AFV sales projections from the Energy Information Administration and the California Air Resources Board, we estimate that the combined policies produce an increase on the order of 100 million tons of CO2 emissions cumulatively for new passenger cars sold from 2012 through 2025 relative to a pure GHG standard. AFV incentives in the GHG standard conflate policy goals by encouraging AFV adoption at the cost of higher fleet GHG emissions, and they permit even higher fleet GHG emissions when other policies, such as the ZEV mandate, increase AFV adoption.",0965-8564,Not found
Alternative pair in the airport network,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.010,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"This paper reveals the existence of “alternative pair” in the airport network. The alternative pair is defined as a pair of airports that, if one of them is closed, the other one can take over part of its traffic load. We find these pairs of airports important as the network performance will not be affected largely if only one airport is disrupted, while simultaneous closure of both airports in an alternative pair will worsen the network performance significantly, as no other airports can accommodate their load. A method is provided to identify the alternative pairs in an airport network and quantify the “alternative strength” between them. The alternative relations between different airport pairs are visualized using the “alternative graph”. By setting different thresholds of alternative strength, the alternative graph exhibits various patterns. The proposed method is applied to two domestic airport networks to obtain some managerial insights. It is found that airport networks are usually robust to the disruption of a single airport, but vulnerable to the simultaneous disruption of an alternative pair; furthermore, the two airports in an alternative pair may not be geographically close to each other in some airport networks.",0965-8564,Not found
Allocation of e-car charging: Assessing the utilization of charging infrastructures by location,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.009,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"The availability of charging infrastructure forms the basis for the enforced market penetration of electric cars. This paper aims to examine the distribution of the allocation of future charges to the various types of charging stations in order to provide a starting point for the evaluation of the need for charging infrastructure, i.e. its number, design and cost-effectiveness. For the case study of Austria, a new approach to derive the allocation of charging processes is applied by using demographic variables and decision rules. As a result, it is found that 88% of the charges are conducted when the user is at home, which is in line with literature. Significantly, fewer charges, approx. 8.8%, are carried out at the workplace. It is a relevant finding of this work relativizing the importance of workplace charging. Only 1.7% are conducted at ‘public charging infrastructure’ (e.g. public car parks, supermarkets, etc.; note that also charging at assigned and freely selectable parking lots when the owner is at home is considered home charging) and 1.5% are conducted at ‘fast charging infrastructure’ (i.e. motorways). It is observed that ‘public charging infrastructure’ is only used for a small proportion of the charges. In conclusion, it can be deduced that some ‘public’ or fast charging stations are unable to recover their costs through charging processes but are subject to other business models.",0965-8564,Not found
Perceived comfort and values of travel time savings in the Rhône-Alpes Region,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.006,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Based on choice experiments conducted in the Rhône-Alpes Region (France), we estimate an Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model that addresses heterogeneity in values of interurban travel time. We evaluate how sensitivity to travel time by public transport is distributed according to the level of comfort. Comfort is modeled as a function of objective attributes and individual perceptions about it: whether a seat is guaranteed, quality of trip experience (feelings experienced), (perceived) use of travel time during the trip, and overall ease of using public transport (perceived behavioral control). The results show that the last two play a significant role in the choice of a public transport mode and that the value of time function is downward sloping with higher levels of objective and perceived comfort. We discuss public policy implications and show that the most effective measure, in terms of economic benefits, would be to optimize and target investments in seat capacity supply.",0965-8564,Not found
Effect of a major network reform on bus transit satisfaction,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.002,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Before enduring a substantial network reform in a system, it is of utmost importance to understand if, how, and why the users’ perception of the system will be affected. In the PT literature, we find evidence about what drives users’ satisfaction. Still, past studies have utilised data that has been mostly retrieved from user surveys during periods where the network and its services were quite stable, or during an economic downturn, in contrast to facing a structural network transformation. Barcelona public bus company (TMB) reformed into a transfer based-network, the NXB (Nova Xarxa de Bus) since 2012. This reform allows discerning which operative, travel, and sociodemographic characteristics affect the users’ satisfaction and their priorities, during a major network reform. We use a three-year customer satisfaction survey (n = 12,511), for our study. Employing a structural equation (SEM) approach, with both numeric and ordinal Probit models, we assess whether critical variables from the bus network reform affect users’ satisfaction significantly. Following a two step-approach, initially an SEM-MIMIC model for the whole population, then a Multi-Group Analysis (MGA), we appraise for different satisfaction models across subpopulations. We propose a reflective latent variable to measure the socioeconomic status (SES), which resulted in significant and negative estimates towards satisfaction, as expected, in all models. Our most important result confirms that users value reliability over other latent satisfaction constructs. Besides the satisfaction constructs, users give an additional relevance to the NXB lines, indicating that intrinsically the users perceive added-value from these lines. Most of the transfers between buses and other transport modes do not affect bus-users satisfaction. Our results imply that efficiently designed transfer-based networks may be a suitable solution from users’ perspective.",0965-8564,Not found
Car pride and its bidirectional relations with car ownership: Case studies in New York City and Houston,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.005,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"The car fulfills not only instrumental transportation functions, but also holds important symbolic and affective meaning for its owners and users. In particular, owning and using a car can be a symbol of an individual’s social status or personal image (‘car pride’). This paper introduces and validates a standard measure of car pride estimated from 12 survey statements using a cross-sectional sample of 1236 commuters in New York City and Houston metropolitan statistical areas. We find that car pride is higher in Houston than in New York City. We then empirically examine the bidirectional relation between car pride (attitude) and household car ownership (behavior) using structural equation modeling. To identify the bidirectional relationship we use an individual’s general pride as the instrumental variable (IV) for that same individual’s car pride; in the opposite direction, we use the average household vehicle ownership in the respondent’s census block group as the IV for the respondent’s household car ownership. We find that positive and statistically significant relations exist from car pride to car ownership, while the relation in the reverse direction is not statistically significant. On average and in both city subsamples, the relation from car pride to household car ownership (attitude-to-behavior) is much stronger than the reverse (behavior-to-attitude). In fact, in our models car pride is more predictive of car ownership than most individual and household socio-demographics included in traditional ownership forecasting models, including income. Empowered with a well-validated, standard measure for car pride and a robust approach for exploring reciprocal attitude-behavior relations in cross-sectional data, future research can extend the current understanding presented in this paper to explore car pride’s relation with other travel behaviors, the dynamics of these attitude-behavior relations over time, and their implications for policies to promote sustainable travel behavior.",0965-8564,Not found
Road tests of self-driving vehicles: Affective and cognitive pathways in acceptance formation,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.004,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"We focus on the pathways (affective vs. cognitive) that guide people’s acceptance of road tests (ART) for self-driving vehicles (SDVs) and behavioral intention (BI) to use SDVs, and propose and test a psychological model to explain these two behavioral responses (i.e., ART and BI) based on the trust heuristic and affect heuristic. These heuristics suggest that affective factors (social trust, positive affect, and negative affect) can directly determine ART and BI following the affective pathway or indirectly influence them through two cognitive responses (perceived benefit and risk) following the cognitive pathway. We conducted a field study involving a Level 3 automated vehicle (AV), invited 300 participants to experience how an AV works in the self-driving mode, and collected their affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses related to SDVs before and after the AV experience. The AV experience increased the psychological model’s explanatory power for perceived benefit, perceived risk, and ART. The affective pathway (vs. cognitive pathway) played a more important role in forming BI and ART. BI was predicted by perceived benefit, social trust, and positive affect, while ART was predicted by social trust and positive affect. The predictive ability of the model for BI and ART was validated. We discuss implications of the results for theory and practice.",0965-8564,Not found
"Modeling passengers’ loyalty to public transit in a two-dimensional framework: A case study in Xiamen, China",10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.007,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Sustaining and improving passengers’ loyalty has become an effective strategy for the development of bus priority. Passengers’ loyalty towards public transportation could be generally assessed in both attitudinal and behavioral levels. Thus, in this context, spuriously loyal passengers could be characterized by attaching a relatively low level of attitude to public transit users who have high behavioral patronage. Due to the lack of attitudinal preference, these passengers have the potential to turn to alternative transportation modes. Therefore, their loyalty should be better assessed, and targeted approaches should be provided to maintain the market share. This paper adopted a cross-classification framework to divide bus riders by considering different levels of loyalty in both attitudinal and behavioral dimensions. The framework led to four specific segments of passengers, and spurious-loyalty users were identified by using clustering analysis methods in a case study in Xiamen, China. Then, Structural Equation Modeling approach was employed, and hypotheses accounting for public transit loyalty were examined and analyzed in a baseline model. Moreover, key factors leading to spurious loyalty were identified, and index score of corresponding variables was calculated. Surprisingly, the results indicated that over half of users who highly adhered to public transit were not attitudinally loyal. However, although these passengers were dissatisfied with the current level of public transit service in specific regions as expected, their willingness of continuing-to-use public transit maintained at a high level. It implied that the cost of shifting to private motorization in Xiamen might still be high, so most spuriously loyal passengers had to continue choosing public transit in the near future. Nevertheless, the key to successfully sustain the long-term development of public transit should still focus on delivering passenger-value-oriented quality services. Therefore, with regards to the improvement of bus service to maintain the market share, targeted measures should be taken in terms of “crowdedness in the bus during peak hours”, “driving stability and comfort”, “bus speed”, “waiting time at stations” and “convenience of route transfers”.",0965-8564,Not found

Considering only those respondents who have used car and PT in the observation period (and thus are familiar with both modes), we find that four user characteristics are able to decompose this substantial difference in median VTTS between car and PT (i.e. the total mode effect) of about 4.9 Euro/h: Posterior means of individual and mode-specific VTTS distributions reveal a reduced mode effect for high income (4.6 Euro/h), female (4.5 Euro/h), low educated (4.3 Euro/h) and urban (3.0 Euro/h) user groups.

Modeling individuals’ willingness to share trips with strangers in an autonomous vehicle future,10.1016/j.tra.2019.03.009,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"With the era of fully automated vehicles (AVs) quickly approaching, ridesharing services could have an important role in increasing vehicle occupancy, reducing vehicle miles traveled, and improving traffic conditions. However, the extent to which these potentials can be achieved depends on consumers’ disposition to sharing rides. From a travel behavior perspective, two essential elements to the adoption of shared rides are individuals’ acceptance of increased travel times associated with pick-up/drop-off of other passengers and their approval of strangers sharing the same vehicle. The current study develops the notion of willingness to share (WTS), which represents the money value attributed by an individual to traveling alone compared to riding with strangers, to investigate the adoption of shared rides. Using a multivariate integrated choice and latent variable approach, we examine current choices and future intentions regarding the use of shared rides and estimate individuals’ WTS as well as their values of travel time for two distinct trip purposes. Results show that users are less sensitive to the presence of strangers when in a commute trip compared to a leisure-activity trip. We also observe that the travel time added to the trip to serve other passengers may be a greater barrier to the use of shared services compared to the presence of a stranger. However, the potential to use travel time productively may help overcome this barrier especially for high-income individuals.",0965-8564,Not found
Analysis of traffic flow with micro-cars with respect to safety and environmental impact,10.1016/j.tra.2019.03.013,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"This study analyzes the characteristics of traffic flow in the presence of micro-cars in a vehicle mix. A two-lane multi-cell traffic cellular automaton (TCA) model is formulated to simulate mixed traffic flow comprising conventional passenger cars and micro-cars. The segments of an urban highway and arterial road, both with two lanes and measuring 700 m in length, are simulated; the latter includes an intersection delay with a signal cycle at the midpoint. Traffic flows with different proportions of micro-cars are investigated in the simulation. Four aspects of traffic conditions are calculated: the number of lane changes, the number of decelerations, the coefficient of speed variation (which may be indicative of safety performance), and the HC, CO, and NOx emissions (as a measure of environmental impact). The simulation results suggest that mixed flow with micro-cars leads to higher frequencies of lane-changing on both highways and arterial roads, although the incremental change on the latter is smaller. With the introduction of micro-cars on the highway, the frequency of decelerations increases in free flow and decreases in congested flow; however, on the arterial road, it decreases the frequency of decelerations and has an insignificant impact on free flow. The introduction of micro-cars has a similar impact on the coefficient of speed variation. Under free flow conditions on highways, the introduction of micro-cars has a negative influence on the three aforementioned parameters related to safety. However, for free flow on arterial roads or congested flow on highways and arterial roads, the results are inconclusive because the effect of micro-cars is contradictory in terms of the three parameters. Vehicle emissions, such as HC, CO, and NOx, increase during free flow on highways, but are always lower on arterial roads.",0965-8564,Not found

The real-time traffic control systems that have been developed during the three last decades include CRONOS-2 which has several advantages under congested situations, in particular, its capacity to control several intersections in a centralized way. A real-site trial has been performed on a zone consisting of five adjacent intersections.

The period is interesting from a research perspective as it offers substantial variation in income, is characterised by structural changes due to increased urbanisation and congestion and at the same time represents a phasing-in period for mobile broadband solutions from almost no coverage to full national coverage. Several things are revealed from the analysis. It is shown that the financial crisis impacts VTTS and that the impact differs across income groups. It is also found that, over the period, VTTS increases by approximately 10%. Although this largely correspond to the growth in the disposable income, it is not possible to point to precise confounders and their relative importance. Rather the paper suggest that the increase in VTTS is caused by a mix of different cofounders, which include (but is not limited to) increasing travel distances, increasing congestion and increasing income.",0965-8564,Not found
Suppressed child pedestrian and bicycle trips as an indicator of safety: Adopting a proactive safety approach,10.1016/j.tra.2019.03.010,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Traditional pedestrian and bicyclist safety analyses typically examine crashes, injuries, or fatalities. However, this reactive approach only accounts for the places where people are currently walking or biking and those that are doing so. Would a proactive approach – examining areas where pedestrian and bicyclist activity is being suppressed because of safety concerns – illuminate other previously neglected safety issues? The goal of this work is to compare results from reactive and proactive pedestrian and bicyclist safety analyses. To accomplish this, we focus on child pedestrians and bicyclists in Denver, Colorado because of the structured characteristics of their travel behavior regarding trips to school. We complete a reactive crash cluster analysis and a proactive safety analysis that is based on trip suppression due to traffic safety concerns. A parental perception survey informs the mode choice model we create for the proactive safety analysis. Findings suggest that reactive approaches identify downtown Denver and major corridors as unsafe, while the proactive analysis also identifies neighborhoods in west, east, and northeast Denver. Due to an absence of crashes, the majority of these areas would not normally be considered unsafe for pedestrians and bicyclists based on conventional reactive approaches. The fact that they are perceived as unsafe may be limiting usage and thereby limiting the number of crashes. In order to improve safety where children are currently walking and bicycling – as well as where they want to walk or bike – traditional analyses would benefit from augmentation by such a proactive safety approach.",0965-8564,Not found
Exploring effects of environment density on heterogeneous populations’ level of service perceptions,10.1016/j.tra.2019.03.007,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"It is necessary to design and evaluate the effectiveness of walking facilities to accommodate the needs of all pedestrian groups, including individuals with disabilities. The Americans with Disability Act (ADA) standard requires that each facility or part of a facility constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall be designed and constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the facility is readily usable by individuals with disabilities. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) defines walking facility performance using a qualitative measure describing operational conditions, or level of service (LOS). However, how closely pedestrian LOS thresholds correspond to pedestrian groups’ perceptions is questionable.

Individuals were tracked using the camera system, and trajectory data extraction was accomplished using a software platform suite. During each experimental session, some participants were randomly selected and asked to complete a questionnaire assessing their walking experience. Using both trajectory and survey data sources, this study explored how a heterogeneous mix of pedestrians perceive and evaluate the operational performance of walking facilities. Specifically, an ordered statistical approach was applied to investigate the effects of environmental density on pedestrians’ perceptions. The results indicated that individuals with disabilities were less tolerant of extremely congested environments. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated that the LOS criteria provided in HCM is inadequate in quantifying the service performance of walking facilities based on the actual perceptions of individuals who participated in the controlled experiment. The findings are expected to improve operational guidelines employed to assess walking facility performance.",0965-8564,Not found
How do activities conducted while commuting influence mode choice? Using revealed preference models to inform public transportation advantage and autonomous vehicle scenarios,10.1016/j.tra.2018.12.015,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"From early studies of time allocation onward, it has been acknowledged that the “productive” nature of travel could affect its utility. Currently, at the margin an individual may choose transit over a shorter automobile trip, if thereby she is able to use the travel time more productively. On the other hand, recent advancements toward partly/fully automated vehicles are poised to revolutionize the perception and utilization of travel time in cars, and are further blurring the role of travel as a crisp transition between location-based activities. To quantify these effects, we created and administered a survey to measure travel multitasking attitudes and behaviors, together with general attitudes, mode-specific perceptions, and standard socioeconomic traits (N = 2229 Northern California commuters). In this paper, we present a revealed preference mode choice model that accounts for the impact of multitasking attitudes and behavior on the utility of various alternatives. We find that the propensity to engage in productive activities on the commute, operationalized as using a laptop/tablet, significantly influences utility and accounts for a small but non-trivial portion of the current mode shares. For example, the model estimates that commuter rail, transit, and car/vanpool shares would respectively be 0.11, 0.23, and 1.18 percentage points lower, and the drive-alone share 1.49 percentage points higher, if the option to use a laptop or tablet while commuting were not available. Conversely, in a hypothetical autonomous vehicles scenario, where the car would allow a high level of engagement in productive activities, the drive-alone share would increase by 1.48 percentage points. The results empirically demonstrate the potential of a multitasking propensity to reduce the disutility of travel time. Further, the methodology can be generalized to account for other properties of autonomous vehicles, among other applications.",0965-8564,Not found
Aggregate road passenger travel demand in New Zealand: A seemingly unrelated regression approach,10.1016/j.tra.2019.03.005,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Road passenger transportation, which includes private vehicles, public transport, and motorcycles, is regarded a vital link that connects people and economic activities across New Zealand. Given the fact that road passenger transport modes are considered substitutes/complements to one another, there is a strong possibility that an interrelationship exists between the travel demand functions, primarily due to the correlation between their disturbances. This research gap is addressed in this study using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) method. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, the study examines whether the error terms of the demands for the four main road passenger transport choices: petrol cars, diesel cars, buses and motorcycles, respectively, are correlated. Second, the study identifies factors that have significant impact on the demand for each available road passenger transport choice. Empirical result from the Breusch-Pagan test of independence confirms the existence of correlated error terms in the demand equations. Moreover, estimated results from the SUR model also highlight various policy implications, including: implementing a fuel tax in the short-run to reduce the travel demand by both petrol and diesel car users, subsidising public transport providers, and several opportunities to alleviate the first-/last-mile problem associated with public transit. Recommendations for further research include developing regional analysis to compare the dynamics of different cities and constructing a forecasting model for private and public transport, and motorcycles, given detailed assumptions about energy and economic conditions.",0965-8564,Not found
Transport poverty and subjective wellbeing,10.1016/j.tra.2019.03.004,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Using 12 waves of longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, we examine the relationship between transport poverty and subjective wellbeing. To measure transport poverty, we use indicators that reflect transport affordability and accessibility. Our preferred two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimates, which instrument for transport poverty using NYSE Arca Oil Stock Prices and OPEC oil supply (in millions of barrels), suggest that a standard deviation increase in transport poverty is associated with a decline in subjective wellbeing between 0.318 and 0.544 standard deviations. This general finding is robust to alternative ways of measuring transport poverty, alternative estimation approaches, alternative approaches to addressing endogeneity of transport poverty, and holds irrespective of whether subjective wellbeing is measured using the single-item overall life satisfaction scale or composite scales such as the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) scale or the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10).",0965-8564,https://github.com/soukhova/Transportation-lit-review
Pleasure or profit? Surveying the purchasing intentions of potential electric vehicle adopters in China,10.1016/j.tra.2019.03.002,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"China is a leading global market for electric mobility, inclusive of e-bikes (motorcycles and scooters) as well as electric vehicles (EVs). This paper provides a novel contribution to the field by examining the factors related to willingness of potential Chinese consumers to further adopt EVs. Much of the research to date has focused primarily on consumer perceptions in European countries, or within particular cities or urban provinces of China. Given that China also is the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, and that transportation is growing in its contribution to China’s national carbon footprint, the potential for larger scale uptake of EVs by Chinese consumers is an important area of research. We therefore utilize a survey instrument among a fairly large national sample (805 respondents across all Chinese provinces) to solicit perceptions of Chinese consumers about their willingness to adopt EVs, and the importance of different types of motivations, controlling for socio-demographic variables. Using descriptive statistics as well as multivariate analysis and principal component analysis, we find that willingness to adopt EVs is associated with performance features of electric vehicles, the perceived benefits of driving an electric vehicle and policy support for the promotion of electric vehicles. We conclude by elaborating on the implications of our findings, namely insights for car dealerships and sales personnel, automotive manufacturers, local and national planners, and users and adopters.",0965-8564,Not found
Measuring immediate impacts of a new mass transit system on an existing bike-share system in China,10.1016/j.tra.2019.03.003,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Mass transit systems as metros thrive nowadays in China – the largest bike-share market all over the world. Hence, it is meaningful to study how a new metro system impact on an existing bike-share system (BS) and understand how they interact to ensure they inter-enhance rather than inter-replace each other. By using trip-pattern and land use to create control and treatment groups based on trip data from Suzhou Public Bicycle System (SPBS), a ‘‘before-and-after’’ study is initiated to measure changes of an existing BS during a period when a new metro system (Here, Metro line 4: M4) opened. Normalized bike flow data (NF) is introduced to cluster and indicate trip-pattern in this study. The result indicates that most SPBS ridership and users within the metro’s catchment (the treatment group) have largely increased since the introduction of the M4, while non-commuting cycling increased more than commuting cycling. The exception happens in metros’ hub, where SPBS ridership slightly decreased after M4. As for SPBS trip-pattern, before M4 was introduced, trip-pattern in CBD areas in Gusu District is found to be partially imbalanced (high returning in the morning and high renting in the evening), while balanced pattern (similar returning and renting in morning and evening) is more often seen in other areas. After M4 was introduced, a general trip-pattern change from the balanced to the imbalanced is observed regardless of land use, except for educational land use existing in Wuzhong District. This further indicates that after new metros was introduced, SPBS tends to serve “first-mile” interchange (origins to metros) rather than “last-mile” interchange (metros to destinations) in the morning and vice versa in the evening regardless of land use type. This unique pattern could lead to different policy and management in enhancing interchanging service between BS and mass transit.",0965-8564,Not found
Assessing and ranking the potential of a street to be redesigned as a Complete Street: A multi-criteria decision aiding approach,10.1016/j.tra.2019.02.006,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"In order to increase the sustainability of transportation in cities, streets must provide infrastructures that favor active and public transportation modes. However, the current decision-making processes in transportation projects do not always explicitly take into account sustainable transportation requirements and often ignore concerns that may arise in other fields such as environmental protection, health, or urban design. The proposed framework in this paper aims at integrating sustainability in a decision-making process by creating better collaboration and communication between professionals of such disparate fields. The framework is based on group workshops, problem structuring, multi-criteria decision aiding and geographic information systems. It was applied in Quebec City, Canada. The objective of the workshops was to identify higher priority streets that should be redesigned as Complete Streets, a popular movement that advocates “streets for everyone” in North America. To facilitate communication and use for future decisions, the results of the analysis were integrated and presented in a geographic information system. As a result, this user-friendly tool is currently used to support decision-making by Quebec City officials who must choose the streets to be redesigned as Complete Streets while ensuring transparency and traceability. Such an approach may better support policies to make the transport system more sustainable by integrating various considerations, being transparent and improving communication of the outcome.",0965-8564,Not found
Connected and autonomous vehicles: A cyber-risk classification framework,10.1016/j.tra.2018.06.033,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"The proliferation of technologies embedded in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) increases the potential of cyber-attacks. The communication systems between vehicles and infrastructure present remote attack access for malicious hackers to exploit system vulnerabilities. Increased connectivity combined with autonomous driving functions pose a considerable threat to the vast socioeconomic benefits promised by CAVs. However, the absence of historical information on cyber-attacks mean that traditional risk assessment methods are rendered ineffective. This paper proposes a proactive CAV cyber-risk classification model which overcomes this issue by incorporating known software vulnerabilities contained within the US National Vulnerability Database into model building and testing phases. This method uses a Bayesian Network (BN) model, premised on the variables and causal relationships derived from the Common Vulnerability Scoring Scheme (CVSS), to represent the probabilistic structure and parameterisation of CAV cyber-risk. The resulting BN model is validated with an out-of-sample test demonstrating nearly 100% prediction accuracy of the quantitative risk score and qualitative risk level. The model is then applied to the use-case of GPS systems of a CAV with and without cryptographic authentication. In the use case, we demonstrate how the model can be used to predict the effect of risk reduction measures.",0965-8564,Not found

Insurance companies thus play an important role as influential stakeholders in the negotiation and implementation processes around this new technology. They can either push the technology (e.g. by offering beneficial, promotional insurance models for semi-autonomous car owners) or constrain it (e.g. by providing restrictive insurance models or no insurance cover at all). Insurers face questions concerning ethical or societal consequences on various levels: not only when it comes to promoting the technology – whose impact is not yet certain and may range from saving to endangering lives – but also with respect to insurance models such as “pay as you drive”, which may involve discriminatory elements. The concept of responsible research and innovation (RRI) is well suited to accompanying and guiding insurers, policy makers and other stakeholders in this field through a responsible negotiation process that may prove beneficial for everyone. Part of the RRI approach is to make stakeholders aware of “soft” factors such as the ethical, societal or historical factors which influence innovation and of the need to include these aspects in their activities responsibly.",0965-8564,Not found

The purpose is to examine how the system and driver are responsible for different stages in the transition timeline, i.e., first alert, handover phase, and return to automated control (handback). This is examined from the perspective of SAE levels in comparison to aspects drawn from situational awareness. The work is complemented by analysis drawn from current practice within the insurance industry and interviews with insurers. The result is a closer examination of system and driver responsibility which is independent of but includes SAE levels with respect to specific handover situations. It also identifies gaps between the current legal liability for accidents when compared to aspects such as the situational awareness requirements placed on driver under different driving conditions.",0965-8564,Not found
"Policy formulation for highly automated vehicles: Emerging importance, research frontiers and insights",10.1016/j.tra.2018.05.010,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Highly automated vehicles (HAVs) generate the optimistic prospect of future smart mobility together with the disruptive influence of traditional policies. Formulating appropriate policies based on applicable methods are necessary to cope with the potential uncertainties of HAVs. By reviewing the literature in a structural manner, this paper analyzes the emerging importance and research frontiers in formulating HAV policies and presents insights gained from three major methods of dealing with uncertain, dynamic, and evolving transport problems. First, the formulation of HAV policy is important for at least three reasons: it may accelerate the development and control of potential uncertainties of HAV, balance technology innovations with traffic security, and provide a steady and efficient migration from human drivers to automated driving systems. Second, current research focuses mainly on the role of government, licensing and testing standards, certification, reliability, policy interventions, public health, legal challenges, and restrictive or supportive policies. A common research framework and methodology of HAV systems has not yet been established to deal with the uncertainties of technology security. Finally, three potential methods of formulating HAV policy are identified herein, namely (1) the backcasting method, which could determine the future of HAV objectives and pathways; (2) the dynamic adaptive method, which makes the policy transition to HAV systems more organic and dynamic; and (3) the policy transfer and migration method, which provides a clear vision of the adaptation procedure. These methods are used in different circumstances to formulate HAV policies. Each method has its pros and cons. The present review provides insights into formulating future HAV policies using these methods.",0965-8564,Not found
Psychophysical assessment of a driver's mental state in autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2018.05.003,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the development of autonomous vehicles. However, some of the challenges that are associated with autonomous vehicles are yet to be resolved. Here, we investigate the user dependence on autonomous control in autopilot vehicles. Further, we verify whether drivers can control the vehicles in an appropriate manner after a system failure based on the range of biometric data. The participants in this study experienced three scenarios in a driving simulator: manual-driving, autonomous-driving, and system-failure scenarios, which forced the participants to resume manual control. The data obtained from salivary amylase depict that drivers tend to be anxious while performing the transition from the manual-driving scenario to the autonomous-driving scenario; however, all drivers have to be accustomed with the system in order to drive using a driving simulator. Thus, the difference of anxiety between various drivers is observed to be suppressed. The seat pressure data illustrate that an area having a value equal to 95% of the probability-deviation ellipse during the second day of the manual-driving and autonomous-driving scenarios is observed to have the largest value from among each driving scenario, which seems to be caused due to the driver’s concentration or fatigue. Further, the systolic blood pressures of all the drivers increased with time. However, in the autonomous-driving scenario, the average relative systolic blood pressure is, on the whole, higher than that in the manual-driving scenario. It is suggested that the drivers had never previously used an autonomous-driving system and that he/she may be uncomfortable or uneasy to autonomously control the brake, accelerator, and steering wheel. Additionally, after a system failure during the manual-driving scenario, the behavior is observed to be similar to that in the initial manual-driving scenario, and the totally average relative systolic blood pressure is higher than that during the initial manual-driving scenario. This indicates that the drivers’ mental workload is relatively low during the autonomous-driving scenario because they do not experience any stress from driving. However, the drivers’ systolic blood pressure increased because of the transition from autonomous driving to manual control and because of the mental workload to control the vehicle on their own just after using an autonomous-driving system. From the viewpoint of the brain activity in the left frontal lobe, the data indicates that the drivers’ cognition level during autonomous driving is lower than that during manual driving and that the declining tendency of the average relative hemoglobin concentration is remarkable during the manual-driving scenario after encountering a system failure. This is because the driver feels that he/she may commit mistakes during manual driving. Additionally, if he/she is driving an autonomous vehicle and if the autonomous-driving system failed, he/she does not need to pay attention to the surrounding subjects and control the vehicle. The eye-gaze data indicate that “mind distraction” occurred in the participants while resuming control after a system failure because their brain activity at this instance was relatively low. Our results indicate that drivers who depend on autonomous control systems experience stress upon switching to manual control after a system failure.",0965-8564,Not found
Spatial prediction of traffic accidents with critical driving events – Insights from a nationwide field study,10.1016/j.tra.2018.05.007,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Despite the fact that semi-autonomous vehicles will become more and more prevalent in the coming decades, recent studies have highlighted that traffic accidents will persist as a core issue for road users, insurers, and policy makers alike. Researchers and industry players see potential in the technology embedded in semi-autonomous vehicles to combat this challenge by reliably predicting locations with a high likelihood of traffic accidents. This technology can be leveraged to detect accidents and ‘near miss incidents’, such as heavy braking and evasive manoeuvres, otherwise known as Critical Driving Events (CDEs). The locations of CDEs could identify areas of high accident exposure, offering automotive insurers a unique opportunity to reduce traffic accidents through the adoption of active loss prevention business models, such as providing safe-routing services and in-vehicle warnings. To date, there is limited empirical evidence on whether the Crash Frequency and Crash Rate of locations can be accurately identified through CDEs. To address this research gap, an 18-week naturalistic driving field study of 72 vehicles was conducted in Switzerland, covering over 690,000 km. Data collected from the CAN Bus of these vehicles indicate that there is a proportional relationship between the CDEs of the fleet, and the Crash Frequency and Crash Rate of a location. Furthermore, a nationwide spatial regression analysis was applied to determine Crash Frequency across the majority of the Swiss road network. We identify the relationship between Crash Frequency, and the CDEs and Trip Frequency of the fleet, along with additional explanatory variables for urban and highway locations. These insights provide first evidence that insurance companies and other industry players with access to a nationwide semi-autonomous fleet can determine existing and emerging locations of high accident probability, enabling more proactive business models and safety focused services.",0965-8564,Not found
Which battery-charging technology and insurance contract is preferred in the electric vehicle sharing business?,10.1016/j.tra.2018.04.010,124,2019-06-01,2019,6,"The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is emerging in the car-sharing business due to the high potential of reducing operational costs as well as greenhouse gas emissions. In this early stage of the EV-sharing business, it is still unclear which battery-charging technology and insurance contract would be more competitive for EV-sharing operators in the context of future business. We have developed a stylized model with which to analyze the impact of different charging technologies, insurance contracts and other related factors on the EV-sharing operator’s profit. The operator’s demand is derived from customers’ utility of driving under a membership scheme. Various operational costs such as electricity and parking place costs are considered. Different battery-charging technologies and insurance contracts are incorporated into the model and then compared. The results show that membership and driving time are strategic complements, and that the operator’s profit is sensitive to policy interventions. Fixed-premium insurance leads to lower prices for the EV-sharing service than per-hour-premium insurance. The per-hour premium fees decrease more significantly than the fixed premium fees as autonomous vehicles reduce accident costs. The conditions for different battery-charging technologies to be price competitive are identified and meaningful policy implications are derived.",0965-8564,Not found

Another novelty of this work is that we provide estimates of quasi- scope economies for the airport industry, defined as the cost advantage for a diversified firm of jointly providing a set of outputs/services with respect to the costs of their provision through a set of firms quasi-specialized in a single production. Our main results suggest the existence of quasi-scope economies that tend to decline with the size of the airport. This finding, coupled with the results of a set of cost complementarity tests, suggest that cost savings mainly arise from the joint provision of services for national and international passengers and, to a lesser extent, to the addition of cargo transport activities. In turn, pairs of outputs that include (a proxy of) commercial revenues seem to be characterized by anti-cost complementarities. Finally, global economies of scale seem to be exhausted at about five million passengers.",0965-8564,Not found

Here, we present three studies (N = 1258) that examine the impact of the environmental benefits (EB) of SDVs on individuals’ acceptance of their risks, and their willingness to ride (WTR) in them. Two types of SDVs were presented: SDVs with a clear mention of positive EB information (“EB-enhanced SDVs”) and SDVs without the mention of positive EB information (“normal SDVs”). Study 1 and Study 2 found that participants expressed higher risk acceptance and WTR regarding EB-enhanced SDVs. Further, Study 2 reported that higher trust in EB-enhanced SDVs, rather than lower negative affect associated with EB-enhanced SDVs, accounted for the participants’ higher risk acceptance and WTR. Study 3 observed that the participants’ acceptable risk of EB-enhanced SDVs was greater than that of normal SDVs in magnitude, although not significant. If SDVs can achieve the purported EB, the public may be willing to tolerate their risks more.

We implement the CO2 emission standards on truck manufacturers as CO2 emission constraints on the new vehicle choice module. The proposed method is formulated as a mixed complementarity problem. The analysis reveals a reduction in road transport CO2 emissions and diesel consumption as a result of an uptake of more efficient truck technologies. In particular, LNG trucks are favored because of the lower emission factor of natural gas relative to that of diesel. Implementing progressively ambitious CO2 standards renders diesel trucks more expensive as their energy efficiency potential reaches its technical limit.",0965-8564,Not found

Findings also reveal that weather’s influence on ridership varies across the course of a day. During morning and evening peak hours, weather is shown to exert a weaker effect than other periods throughout the day.

Road infrastructure and public bus transport service provision under different funding schemes: A simulation analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2019.05.001,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"There is a large and still growing literature on road pricing; there is also a large literature on public transport pricing and provision. However, the integration of these subtopics with the subtopic of road capacity provision as a unified topic is very small (Lindsey, 2012). Therefore, we seek to gain a better understanding of the interplay of transport pricing, transport service provision, cost recovery, together with an explicit consideration of equity in a unified fashion. To do so, we carry out a simulation analysis, as theoretical results in second-best contexts are not clean and depend on assumptions on relevant parameters. Under the assumptions of parameters typical of a city like Santiago de Chile, the most relevant conclusions of this research are the following. First, if road infrastructure provision and its pricing are jointly determined, road infrastructure provision is lower when adequately priced through user charges, with car speeds in the peak period increasing very close to free-flow speeds. Second, if user charges are designed to achieve cost recovery of road investments, public bus transport ridership will increase, taking full advantage of social economies of scale. Third, welfare redistribution through transport market interventions is limited. Fourth, if car use is subsidised, most of the benefits, if not all, of subsidising public transport are undone. Fifth, if road pricing were to be implemented in actual urban contexts, reallocation of road space away from private vehicles (even road closure) could become a reality, especially in denser parts of cities.",0965-8564,Not found

To address the complex impacts of these strategies on automobile travelers, a stage-based model framework is developed to analyze their mode shift decision-making process (whether they will shift from using automobile to public transit, biking or walking or continue using automobile) under these strategies. Four multilevel structural equation models are created for participants using automobile (personal vehicle and/or taxi) as the most common mode of transportation (hereafter referred to as “more habitual automobile travelers”) and those using automobile as second most common mode (hereafter referred to as “less habitual automobile travelers”) under each strategy. Model estimation results show that the impacts of latent psychological factors on mode shift decisions under congestion pricing and reward strategies are significantly different between more and less habitual automobile travelers. The results also show that congestion pricing strategies are more effective than reward strategies in promoting mode shifts among more habitual automobile travelers, while the opposite is observed for less habitual automobile travelers. This study provides insights for designing congestion pricing and reward strategies and illustrates the importance of developing complementary modules that target numerous factors in different stages of the mode shift decision-making process to effectively promote mode shifts from automobile to sustainable travel modes in China.",0965-8564,Not found

We are particularly interested in the mediating role that attitudes towards the environment have on the relationship between early age Internet use and sustainable travel in young adults. The use of rich, longitudinal datasets, the 2004 British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Understanding Society Survey (Wave 4, 2012/14), allow an investigation of these attitudes and relationships for the same people from childhood to adulthood. We use structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the complex interrelationships between young adults’ Internet use over time, their travel modes and attitudes towards the environment, and other related behaviors. Our key finding is that consistently high levels of Internet use between adolescence and young adulthood is associated with the formation of environmental attitudes. While other factors not considered in this study might also have an effect, we find that these attitudes are indirectly but significantly associated with young adults’ sustainable travel patterns and behaviors.",0965-8564,Not found
Multimodal divide: Reproduction of transport poverty in smart mobility trends,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.018,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This paper makes a critical contribution to the discussion about the transition from an automobile society to a multimodal society in Western transport and mobility research, which is characterised by a flexible use of different transport options. This discussion is fuelled, in particular, by the emergence of smart mobility, in which information and communication technologies (ICTs) – e.g., the smartphone – are used to switch flexibly between new interconnected mobility services (such as carsharing, ridesharing, bikesharing, bus or train). The starting point for the scepticism towards this transition is the research on transport poverty, which problematizes social exclusions from participation in mobility due to the unequal distribution of mode options. This paper suggests a change of perspective from the real mode choice to potential/optional mode choice in order to account for this scepticism in the research on multimodal behaviours. Multioptionality is conceptualised as a necessary precondition for multimodal behaviours to achieve this change of perspective. Based on this conceptualisation, three theses result from a quantitative analysis of a data set from an area in the Rhine-Main region in Germany. The theses challenge the often-postulated potential ubiquity of multimodal behaviours: (i) Transport poverty – represented by a lack of mode options – inhibits the potential production of multimodal behaviours, particularly by socially marginalised people (low income, low education, precarious job situation, etc.). (ii) A multimodal divide describes the reproduction of transport poverty in the guise of modernisation, as the transport poor – with few mode options – also lack certain ICTs that provide central access media to smart mobility. (iii) Another (perfidious) form of social exclusion from participation in smart mobility concerns critical thinkers who avoid installing mobility applications to protect their privacy. This exclusion occurs because these apps do not have an alternative as access software to smart mobility.",0965-8564,Not found
Incentive game of investor speculation in PPP highway projects based on the government minimum revenue guarantee,10.1016/j.tra.2019.05.006,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Mechanisms for risk sharing are critical in infrastructure project financing. In public-private partnerships (PPP) for highway projects, provision of guarantees by the government to the investors is an important risk-sharing scheme. Because the government does not have the same information that private investors have, information asymmetry leads to speculation. In this paper, investors grab minimum revenue guarantee by deliberately reducing in earnings is identified as a moral hazard. To solve this problem, a game theory model for studying mechanisms that encourage/incentivize investors to adopt a positive attitude toward cooperation with the government is established. In particular, we design incentive mechanisms that engage private investors based on their profitability outlook. The results show that blindly increasing the amount of a reward or a penalty is not an effective way to guide an investor’s behavior. Adopting flexible incentive mechanisms during different stages of a project proves effective in influencing investors’ willingness to cooperate with the government as well as in maximizing the benefits they realize from the project.",0965-8564,Not found
Energy audits in shipping companies,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.017,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"An energy audit is a method for determining the most cost-effective measures that improve energy efficiency in an organisation. This article describes a longitudinal action-research case study of an energy audit performed in 2012 on a short-sea ship owner and operator and a follow-up study conducted three years later. The study showed that following the suggestions made in the audit would have had a significant economic impact but that few of the audit recommendations had been successfully implemented. An analysis of the qualitative and quantitative material collected during these two studies pointed in particular to the need to understand energy efficiency measures in their organisational context; many of the measures concerned redesigning organisational routines. It became obvious that more studies of practice are needed in order to evaluate policies and programmes aimed at achieving a transition to low carbon emissions in the maritime sector. Despite the failure of this particular audit, energy audits in shipping companies should be paid more attention because of their relative success in other sectors.",0965-8564,Not found
Availability of private charging infrastructure influences readiness to buy electric cars,10.1016/j.tra.2019.05.004,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"If countries are to fulfil their pledges to the Paris Agreement, then EVs will almost certainly have to diffuse rapidly, dominating the market within 20 years. The results of a randomized controlled survey that we administered suggest that access to private charging infrastructure may become a factor influencing people’s willingness to purchase EVs in the coming years, potentially an important factor. People who own their parking space, and for whom private charging access is unproblematic, were almost twice as likely to indicate a high willingness to purchase an EV as those who park their car on the street, and 50% more likely than those who park their car in a shared lot or garage. For those parking on the street, suggesting that chargers would be installed free of charge resulted in these people being equally likely as parking space owners to indicate a high willingness to purchase an EV. For those people parking in a shared lot or garage, this suggestion had a more moderate effect.",0965-8564,Not found

The objective of this paper is to analyze which type of public transport service best fit the periphery and compare alternative services based on a set of quantities and qualitative measures with emphasize on equity considerations. We applied for the first time the Potential Mobility Index (PMI) developed by Martens (2016) to analyze the equity implications of the alternatives. We applied it in a new and unique way with two measures of travel time: in-vehicle travel time and door to door travel time. The research applies the methodology to a case study of Israel’s peripheral cities. Two different alternative services were analyzed: high-speed rail to the Northern and Southern peripheral cities, and a fix schedule regional BRT shuttle service with a timed transfer to rail hubs near the periphery. The accessibility measures show that the rail service to the periphery provides high accessibility, however, the demand analysis suggests that the demand would be low to justify high-speed rail service. The analysis of the in-vehicle time PMI shows an advantage to the high-speed rail alternative, however, the door to door calculation of PMI shows that the BRT service gives better PMI scores to all the peripheral cities that we examined and can be effective in providing a high quality of service to the periphery. The results provide some insights for research and service planning in rural areas and found some generalization to equity aspects in the periphery dilemma.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of accessibility by public transport on real estate values: A comparison between the cities of Rome and Santander,10.1016/j.tra.2018.07.015,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that greater accessibility to opportunities can have a positive impact on real estate values. However, this capitalisation of the benefits of accessibility could vary between different study areas. This research estimates hedonic and spatial hedonic models in two urban areas to compare if differences can be found in the impact accessibility using public transport has on residential property values. The two study areas chosen for comparison are a medium sized city without any major mobility problems (Santander, Spain) and a very large city with major congestion problems (Rome, Italy). The estimated hedonic models have considered the possible presence of spatial effects, a common occurrence with real estate data which may generate dependency in the residuals of hedonic models. Accessibility has been measured using two types of indicators: relative and gravity based. The results confirm that accessibility was a positive factor on property prices in both cities, although in Santander this was only true using the relative indicator to the city centre. These results are relevant for supporting the introduction of value capture policies which provide finance for new projects to extend and encourage greater use of public transport.",0965-8564,Not found

However, the potential of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve access to opportunities has been rarely explored. In a scenario where disparities exist in both physical proximity and access to ICT, this study aims to analyse the interrelationships between three key areas viz. ICT, social disadvantage, and activity participation behaviour. A time use survey representative of Mumbai’s housing disparity was conducted for 1205 individuals. The data showcased the differences in household socio-economic characteristics, individual personal characteristics, ICT use patterns, activity participation, and time allocation patterns. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate exclusionary factors and their interconnectedness. It was found out that ‘social advantage’ had a significant positive relationship with ‘access to ICT’ and ‘farness to services’. The effects of exclusionary factors, along with activity and individual specific variables were tested on activity participation and time allocation behaviour using type II Tobit models. Finally, marginal effects of ‘access to ICT’ and ‘farness to services’ on activity participation and time allocation behaviour were estimated. The findings suggested that an increase in access to ICT increased in-home leisure participation and travel time allocation. However, no significant positive relationship was established between access to ICT and in-home mandatory activities. Policy implications of the findings were discussed highlighting the importance of an integrated framework to improve both physical access and the access to ICT to tackle the issue of social exclusion.",0965-8564,Not found

Discussing the groups of regional people most likely to be at risk of social exclusion, because of poor mobility opportunities, the paper notes pre-school children as a new focus for policy and research attention. It then highlights the importance of trip making and building bridging social capital to reduce the risk of social exclusion in a regional setting, showing that, while regional people at high risk of social exclusion may achieve relatively high trip making (mobility, often via active travel), they may still have problems taking trips that build their bridging social capital.

A conceptual framework to formulate transportation network design problem considering social equity criteria,10.1016/j.tra.2018.04.005,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"In recent years, researchers have developed new methods to measure how transport decisions affect different groups of society. An example is the distribution of impacts (benefits and costs) from roadway investments, and the degree that the results are considered equitable (also called fair or just). Such decisions affect people’s ability to access services and activities, and therefore their economic opportunities and development. This study suggests ways of incorporating social equity measures in transportation network planning. It describes various equity impacts that can result from transportation planning decisions, discusses various social equity concepts and theories, reviews previous attempts to incorporate equity considerations into transport networks modeling, and suggests a framework for simultaneously optimizing network design and achieving social equity objectives. According to this framework, network design can be formulated using bi-level integer programming models corresponding to seven major social equity approaches along with the classical approach of “Total Travel Time Minimization.” An accessibility variable is used as the distributable benefit. This approach is more comprehensive and flexible than previous equity impact models. The proposed framework can be used to evaluate and optimize the equity impacts of various infrastructure investment decisions.",0965-8564,Not found
Modeling horizontal and vertical equity in the public transport design problem: A case study,10.1016/j.tra.2018.04.006,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"In the transportation literature, equity has been and is still used with a variety of meanings and purposes. Traditionally, equity has been considered in strategic transport planning but very few works have been addressing it in a quantitative way, detailing how to explicitly consider it at a transportation design level (tactical and/or operational) focusing on the consequent social role of transportation. This paper deals with how to quantitatively incorporate spatial and social equity principles in the Transit Network Design Problem. With respect to our previous preliminary study, this paper goes a step further in the definition of the solution to the problem, proposing a starting candidate route set generation procedure as a preliminary step to solve before the main optimization. The objective function considers at the same time the cost of users, operators and unsatisfied demand, and a comprehensive horizontal and vertical equity indicator is also specified among the constraints of the problem. An extensive sensitivity analysis investigates how the costs of the system vary with respect to the achieved level of equity. Then, an application to a real case of study is presented to validate the proposed methodology and highlight its usefulness and performances.",0965-8564,Not found
Long-term differential effects of transport infrastructure investment in rural areas,10.1016/j.tra.2018.01.026,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"European and national transport policies identify territorial cohesion as their main goal. However, the lack of attention to intra-regional relationships has complicated the understanding of the diverse repercussions of these policies on the economic and social equity of rural areas over time. Long-term assessments of transport effects in these less studied areas, which cover more than two thirds of the European territory, are essential to identify common problems associated with transport investments and to detect potential strategies to confront their future challenges. This paper, analyses the effects of transport policy development in the Spanish Northwest Area over the last 20 years, where about 95% of municipalities are considered rural. The assessment focuses on the spatial effects of transport development, using a Geographical Information System (GIS), and inequality and correlation analyses of accessibility, demographic and economic indicators. Results show that while the accessibility gap between urban and rural areas was reinforced by the construction of high-capacity infrastructures during the first half of the study period, the completion of the network during the second decade balanced this situation, enabling a more equitable access to basic services, goods and opportunities. However, these improvements have not been enough to reverse the initial lagging inertia of the rural areas and to reduce their socioeconomic disadvantages against urban ones.",0965-8564,Not found
Elevating access: Comparing accessibility to jobs by public transport for individuals with and without a physical disability,10.1016/j.tra.2018.02.017,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Equal access to opportunities has emerged in public transport planning as a social objective that many transport agencies are trying to achieve. Yet in practice, not all public transport agencies are currently providing urban residents with comparable levels of service due to physical barriers in the public transport network that can significantly hinder the ability of individuals with physical disabilities to access opportunities. In countries without a strong federal accessibility act and/or with major financial constraints, some public transport agencies fall behind in applying universal access design principles, making it even harder for people with a physical disability to access opportunities. The objective of this study is to develop a methodology that can be used by public transport agencies or disability advocates to clearly highlight and quantify the performance of the public transport network in a region, in terms of providing transit services to people in a wheelchair and compare that to the service offered to an individual not in a wheelchair. In this study we use accessibility, the ease of reaching destinations, by public transport as the key performance measure in two major Canadian Cities (Montreal and Toronto). Furthermore, we focus on job accessibility in the most socially vulnerable census tracts in both cities, to evaluate levels of job accessibility for wheelchair users residing in socially vulnerable areas. The findings from our study show striking contrasts between the numbers of accessible jobs by public transport for wheelchair users compared to the general population. On average, wheelchair users in Toronto have access to 75% of jobs that are accessible to users that are not in a wheelchair, whilst their counterparts in Montreal have access to only 46% of the jobs accessible to other users. This research is expected to highlight for public transport engineers, planners, policy makers and advocates for those with disabilities, the importance of universal access in a region, especially along public transport networks, using a widely used land use and transport performance measure.",0965-8564,Not found
Exploring the potential of mobile phone records and online route planners for dynamic accessibility analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2018.02.008,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Big Data sources offer new possibilities for urban mobility and accessibility studies. As people carry out their activities in a city, they leave behind a digital fingerprint that can be used to analyze the population’s daily mobility patterns and determine the exact times of travel between points of origin and destination at different times of the day. These data present high spatial and temporal resolution, and enable accurate and dynamic analysis of accessibility. The objective of this study was to conduct a dynamic analysis of urban accessibility considering its two main components: travel times and the attractiveness of destinations. To this end, we calculated travel times between transport zones using the Google Maps API and constructed origin and destination (OD) travel matrices from mobile phone records. Several scenarios were generated to analyze dynamic accessibility and the separate influence of its two components. We also conducted a cluster analysis to characterize transport zones according to their accessibility in each of the scenarios and times of day considered. Our results indicate that these new sources of geolocated data show considerable potential for use in time-sensitive accessibility studies, since they yield more accurate and realistic information than static or partially dynamic analyses. Such information could help politicians take better decisions concerning transport and land use.",0965-8564,Not found

"The relationship between transport disadvantage and employability: Predicting long-term unemployment based on job seekers’ access to suitable job openings in Flanders, Belgium",10.1016/j.tra.2018.01.023,125,2019-07-01,2019,7,"In no research domain has the application of accessibility been so vital as in the area of linking disadvantaged individuals to job opportunities. The inability to reach locations of employment and, therefore, partake in paid labor is considered to have severe consequences on an individual’s economic security and quality of life as well as society’s general level of welfare. Unfortunately, existing studies on job accessibility primarily apply aggregate measures that aim to link the population group of active, employed workers to pre-existing job locations. As a result, they fail to capture the person-specific labor-market opportunities for those individuals who are actually unemployed as well as the degree to which accessibility to opportunities is related to actual employment rates. The proposed paper answers this limitation by constructing a predictive model for long-term unemployment for job seekers in Flanders, Belgium, dependent on their access by private and public transport to job openings that correspond to their individual preferences and competences. In addition to accessibility, the predictive capacity was determined for various socio-demographics such as age, gender, migration background, educational background and preferred job type. The proposed regression model shows that job accessibility is negatively related to long-term unemployment. In addition, various inequities in long-term unemployment exist for the selected case study. Especially job seekers with a migration background and with higher age (55 years or older) have significantly higher probabilities of remaining unemployed. A conditional inference regression tree indicates that the most disadvantaged groups have a two to three times higher probability of being long-term unemployed. Moreover, higher accessibility levels prove to only benefit those who already are in a more advantaged position. These findings have important ramifications for policies focusing on improving employment rates, as they allow to specifically address those areas of research where major gains can be made.",0965-8564,Not found

In this paper, we investigate the impact Germany’s aviation tax has had on passenger numbers using the synthetic control method to generate counterfactual passenger numbers for German airports, and for airports outside Germany but near the German border. The results are consistent with passengers engaging in cross-border substitution in response to the aviation tax. Most tax exempt airports near German borders have made sizeable gains in passenger numbers since Germany introduced its aviation tax. Within Germany there appears to be a clear distinction in the impact on small/regional airports and that on larger hubs. From a policy perspective, the finding of a cross-border substitution effect implies that the aviation tax might not be effective in curbing overall emissions from air travel, whilst also leading to lost tax revenues through the displacement of passengers to neighbouring countries.",0965-8564,Not found
Estimating the long-run metro demand elasticities for Lisbon: A time-varying approach,10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.019,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"This paper provides the first estimation of long-run demand elasticities for Lisbon’s metro, covering the lifetime of the metro’s operation from 1960 until 2017. The findings indicate that the metro patronage is relatively more responsive to changes in the fare than to changes in service level, with long-run elasticity values ranging between −0.45 to −0.84 for metro travel card and between 0.45 and 0.50 for service level. This implies that fare policies are likely to be more effective at influencing patronage than supply policies. We also find a substitution effect between the metro and private motorized transport, but not between the metro and the urban bus/tram system. There is also evidence of a strong relation between wage and metro demand for poorer individuals, which we interpret as an indication of greater mobility constrains faced by these individuals for whom an increase in income level only permits more mobility by public transport. Finally, we also implement a recursive time-varying method to investigate the presence of structural breaks resulting from the very large increase in metro prices and the strong reduction in service level during the period of economic crisis and public finance imbalances that followed the financial and economic crisis of 2008. During this period, metro demand elasticities changed, especially for the metro fare, suggesting it became more elastic.",0965-8564,Not found
Recommendation of feeder bus routes using neural network embedding-based optimization,10.1016/j.tra.2019.05.005,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Despite the existence of vast bus and subway networks, the demand for taxis in the morning commute hours is substantial in metropolitan areas. This kind of morning traffic can be resolved by means of feeder buses connecting residential areas with popular transit points. To assist the design of feeder bus routes, this study proposes an optimization approach based on road2vec, which is applied to real-time taxi GPS data. Road2vec is a neural network-based embedding methodology that extracts road name vectors considering the movement patterns of vehicles. Subsequently, the k-means clustering analysis is applied to those vectors to identify the major taxi transit clusters during the commute hours. For each cluster, we suggest a feeder bus route that can best reflect the taxi trajectory patterns. To find intermediate stops between the departure and origin of a feeder bus route, we solve an integer programming to maximize the cosine similarity between the origin road vector and the departure road vector subtracted by the road vectors of intermediate stops. The suggested routes based on our method differ from the existing routes in that they have a tendency to pass through residential areas, transit stations, and schools. In addition, the result suggests that the model developed in this study finds bus routes that could be suitable for feeder buses by accommodating areas where the demand for taxis is high in the morning. Our road2vec approach is expected to contribute to a reduction in traffic during rush hours.",0965-8564,Not found

The model is empirically evaluated using data from the 2010–12 California Household Travel Survey. The model identifies six household-level classes that differ in terms of their preferences for different neighbourhood attributes when deciding where to live and their household characteristics. Coincidentally, the model also identifies six individual-level classes that differ in terms of the travel modes that they consider when deciding how to travel, their sensitivity to different level-of-service attributes, and their individual characteristics. Household preferences for neighbourhood types and individual preferences for travel modes show expected patterns of correlation. In general, households that prefer to live in suburban neighbourhoods are more likely to consist of individuals that are car-dependent, and households that prefer to live in inner-city neighbourhoods are more likely to consist of individuals that are multimodal. However, our analysis also reveals interesting patterns of deviation. For example, high-income migrant households and median-income white households display strong preferences for suburban neighbourhoods, but individuals belonging to these households also have a high likelihood of being multimodal, with a strong preference for bicycling. We discuss how these patterns of correlation can be used to inform transport and land use policy in novel ways.",0965-8564,Not found
Employer perceptions of the business benefits of sustainable transport: A case study of peri-urban employment areas in South West England,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.012,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"There is considerable interest in the contribution that workplace-based mobility management interventions can make to achieving more sustainable mobility patterns. A number of studies have evaluated the impacts of workplace-based interventions on the commuting behaviour of staff, but the broader potential of such initiatives depends on the willingness of employers to support them. Little research has been carried out examining the perspectives of senior managers. The research which has been conducted has focused on employers located in urban or rural areas. This paper reports on in-depth interviews with senior managers of employers located in two peri-urban areas on the edge of the city of Bristol, south-west England. The research was carried out during a period when public funding was available to support the introduction of sustainable transport measures. The interviews aimed to find out whether senior managers perceived the promotion of sustainable transport as relevant to their business concerns, and how this varied between different types of organisation. The results showed that all managers believed that measures to increase the use of alternative modes for commuting and local business travel could be beneficial for their business, even if these benefits were indirect and difficult to quantify. The perceived benefits of sustainable transport included: helping to ease traffic congestion on the road network, thereby reducing associated delays and stress; helping employers manage excessive demand for car parking; improving staff wellbeing; and widening the recruitment opportunities among workers lacking access to a private car. Employers who perceived the greatest benefits were also the most willing to engage with public authorities in introducing new workplace-based mobility measures. The findings on employer support for mobility management are relevant not only to peri-urban areas but also to employment sites within other areas (in particular suburban areas and the rural hinterland) where the same challenges may apply of encouraging alternatives to single occupancy car use without the means to invest in comprehensive public transport.",0965-8564,Not found
Analysis of alternative treatments for left turn bicycles at tandem intersections,10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.020,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"To improve the practical capacity of the tandem intersections and eliminate the conflicts between left-turn bicycles and left-turn vehicles at the main signal, four alternative designs are proposed from the aspects of time separation and spatial separation. In terms of time separation, left-turn bicycles and left-turn vehicles are separated by the two-step crossing for left-turn bicycles design and the exclusive phase for pedestrian and bicycles design. In terms of spatial separation, exclusive passing space for left-turn bicycles is provided by using partial left-turn design in the sorting area and moving the stop line backward. A linear programming model, which combining four optimization designs into one unified optimization framework, is established with the objective of maximizing the practical capacity of vehicles. A case study and extensive numerical analysis are used to validate the effectiveness and identify the application domain of these alternative designs. The results demonstrate the promising effect of the two-step crossing for left-turn bicycles design and the moving the stop line backward design in avoiding conflicts between left-turn bicycles and vehicles while improving the vehicular capacity. The two-step crossing for left-turn bicycles design can improve 10–20% vehicular capacity under almost all analysis conditions, but it increases the delay of left-turn bicycles. The benefit of the moving stop line backward design is sensitive to cycle length and the proportion of left-turn vehicles. It performs well when the cycle time exceeds 90 s, and the proportion of left-turn vehicles exceeds 30%.",0965-8564,Not found

Shadow input costs are estimated using Class I railroad cost information from 1983 to 2015 to examine the change in input usage over time. Using labor as the benchmark of comparison, we find that the use of all inputs aligns in a more allocatively efficient way with labor now than in 1983. This comports well with the notion that significant easing of work rule restrictions facilitates a more efficient use of labor relative to non-labor inputs.",0965-8564,Not found

This study thus examines cultural affective meanings of a broad range of conventional and novel transport mode options in a nationally representative German sample. Cluster analysis of affective meanings of travel modes identified six unique traveller segments. These consumer groups differ significantly in their intention to adopt low-emission travel modes and are characterized by specific psychographic, socio-demographic and behavioural profiles. The results demonstrate that affective meanings of choice options are predictive regarding the attitudes and (intended) behaviour of traveller segments. Moreover, the invariant positive meanings of conventional cars across segments indicate the strong cultural embeddedness of this mode in society. We discuss the implications of our approach for the development of government strategies for sustainable transport.",0965-8564,Not found
Public transit cost efficiency studies: The impact of non-contracting regulations,10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.010,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"This paper studies the effects of non-contracting regulations on the efficiency of U.S. public transit systems. First, it estimates a system of cost and input demand equations and second, a frontier equation with technical inefficiency a function of regulation and heterogeneity variables. It finds that bus useful-life regulation makes transit systems overuse capital relative to labor, contracting out entire service is 7.2% cheaper than direct operation, and a mixed operation that combines direct operations with contracting-out has no statistically significant effect on cost. Also, according to the study’s results, the U.S. labor protection regulation (Section 13c) and contracting out entire service make transit systems overuse capital and non-labor inputs relative to labor respectively. Overall the study finds that the regulations increase technical change by a small amount and make transit systems perceive their costs as low, which in turn makes them produce more output. Other findings are, the average transit system is 73% technically efficient, 68% allocative efficient and 50% cost efficient. Finally, incentive regulation increases technical inefficiency, bus useful-life regulation reduces technical inefficiency, and transit systems that contract-out their entire services have high levels of technical inefficiency.",0965-8564,Not found
A mixture-amount stated preference study on the mobility budget,10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.009,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The mobility budget is considered a promising new tool in remuneration and transport policy in Belgium, especially due to its potential of shrinking the company car fleet and lowering car use. Because revealed preference data were scarce in the context of the mobility budget, we conducted a stated preference study to examine the potential outcomes of the introduction of the mobility budget. A challenge in our study is that it required the respondents to choose between mixtures of remunerations for different total budget amounts. In other words, the study was a mixture-amount stated preference study, which involved modeling challenges as well as experimental design challenges. In this paper, we therefore introduce advanced mixture-amount regression models in the choice modeling literature and present a generic method to set up mixture-amount stated preference studies to collect suitable data. Our case-study data comes from an online questionnaire administered to employees at 12 large companies in Belgium (n = 817). For our choice data, a second-order polynomial mixture model in combination with a quadratic effect for the amount led to the most suitable utility function. Our results indicate that current company car users prefer additional days off, income or a car. The bicycle, pedelec and public transport options are disregarded by most employees. Based on our results, we call for a critical reflection on the current system of company cars and reimbursements in Belgium.",0965-8564,Not found
Data monitoring for the assessment of on-street parking demand in CBD areas of developing countries,10.1016/j.tra.2019.05.009,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"On-street parking is considered as one of the essential and critical components of the urban transportation system. Despite urban sprawl, central business district (CBD) areas continue to attract significant number of trips, especially for shopping, trade and commerce purposes. Most of the cities in developing countries lack the mechanisms to monitor on-street parking demand. Further, the absence of unambiguous on-street parking policy has led to the phenomenon of largely disorganized on-street parking, especially in these cities. Therefore, to formulate parking management measures, it becomes imperative to assess existing on-street parking demand in a rational manner. To comprehend the objective, on-street parking survey using the license plate method was carried out for three days covering a normal working day, weekend and an event day at data monitoring interval of 10 min during peak parking hours for two diverse land-use types namely commercial and hospital in four metropolitan cities of Gujarat, India. Investigations revealed that the data monitoring interval significantly affected recorded parking demand. Recorded parking demand was observed to be insignificant after 30 min and 50 min data monitoring interval for commercial and hospital land-use respectively. The behaviour of parkers was probed by extracting percentage unique of parked vehicles (PUPV). PUPV revealed uniform parking behaviour in different cities, with progressively increasing trend as the data monitoring interval increased. Turnover (E2W/hr/bay) was evaluated for different data monitoring intervals and revealed a decaying trend with an increase in data monitoring interval. The consistency of PUPV (in form of the coefficient of variation (CV)) was observed at 30 min and 50 min data monitoring interval for commercial and hospital land-use respectively. Therefore, to capture all possible variation in on-street parking demand, the study proposes to perform on-street parking inventory and on-street parking evaluation at 30 min and 50 min data monitoring interval for commercial and hospital land-use respectively. The study provides a fundamental insight into the assessment of on-street parking demand using different data monitoring intervals and can accordingly facilitate planners and policymakers to formulate on-street parking demand management measures in developing countries.",0965-8564,Not found
Effects of traffic control regulation on Network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram: A statistical analysis of real data,10.1016/j.tra.2019.05.012,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"This research aims to verify the influence of traffic control strategies using signal plans at junctions on observed Network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (NMFD), as a variable to describe the aggregate traffic conditions of an urban road network. After establishing the theoretical basis of its existence, the research on NMFDs has been finalized for applications connected to traffic congestion control and management. The degree NMFD depends on traffic control strategies has not been fully demonstrated, nor has its relationship with different congestion levels. In the opinion of the authors, experimental NMFDs based on observed traffic data in the presence of different control strategies are key elements in supporting the understanding of this relationship. The paper has been structured into two parts. The first part presents the formulation of an optimization model for the design of signal plans at junctions which incorporates NMFD variables. The more extensive second part examines the effects of traffic control strategies on observed NMFDs, built with real traffic data. The investigation follows a procedure where observed traffic data are analysed to find variables, functions and diagrams at link and network levels (NMFD). The procedure is applied in two adjacent urban zones located in the central area of Santander (Spain). These zones were identified according to traffic characteristics and land uses. The junctions on the road sub-networks in the two zones have different control regulations, but they are used by the same road users (with the same behavioural strategy). Observed traffic data (flows, densities) from loop sensors have been collected and correlated with the signal control plans at different periods of a working day. What emerges from the analysis is that junction regulation affects traffic flow variables at a link and network level. The NMFDs are statistically different when comparing junction regulations at two homogenous adjacent zones. The results apply only to the studied area and should be confirmed in other real transport systems.",0965-8564,Not found
Risk preference and adoption of autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.007,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Despite an increasingly large body of research that focuses on the potential demand for autonomous vehicles (AVs), risk preference is an understudied factor. Given that AV technology and how it will interact with the evolving mobility system are highly risky, this lack of research on risk preference is a critical gap in current understanding. By using a stated preference survey of 1142 individuals from Singapore, this study achieves three objectives. First, it develops one measure of psychometric risk preference and operationalizes prospect theory to create two economic risk preference parameters. Second, it examines how these psychometric and economic risk preferences are associated with socioeconomic variables. Third, it analyzes how risk preference influences the mode choice of AVs. The study finds that risk preference parameters are significantly associated with socioeconomic variables: the elderly, poor, females, and unemployed Singaporeans appear more risk-averse and tend to overestimate small probabilities of losses. Furthermore, all three risk preference parameters contribute to the prediction of AV adoption. These modeling results have policy implications at both the aggregate and disaggregate levels. At the aggregate level, people misperceive probabilities, are overall risk-averse, and hence under-consume AVs relative to the social optimum. At the disaggregate level, the elderly, poor, female, and unemployed are more risk-averse and thus are less likely to adopt AVs. These results suggest that it might be valuable for governments to implement policies to encourage technology adoption, particularly for disadvantaged social groups, although caution remains due to uncertainty in the long-term effects of AVs. Individualized risk preference parameters could also inform how to design regulations, safety standards, and liability allocations of AVs since many regulations are essentially mechanisms for risk allocation. One limitation of the paper is that risk preference is measured and modeled only as individual-specific but not alternative-specific variables. Future studies should examine the relationship between the multiple components of risk preference and the multiple risky aspects of AVs.",0965-8564,Not found
Forecasting transportation demand for the U.S. market,10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.008,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"In this paper we forecast air, road and train transportation demand for the U.S. domestic market based on econometric and machine learning methodologies. More specifically, we forecast transportation demand for various horizons up to 18 months ahead, for the period 2000:1–2015:03, employing, from the domain of machine learning, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) and from econometrics, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and the Ordinary Least Squares regression. In doing so, we follow the relevant literature and consider the contribution of selected variables as potential regressors in forecasting. Our empirical findings suggest that while all models outperform the Random Walk benchmark, the machine learning applications adhere more closely to the data generating process, producing more accurate out-of-sample forecasts than the classical econometric models. In most cases, we find that the transportation demand is driven by fuel costs, except for road transportation where macroeconomic conditions affect transportation volumes only for specific forecasting horizons. This finding deviates from the existing literature, given the support of previous studies to macroeconomic conditions are driving factors of transportation demand. Our work relates directly to decisions on transport infrastructure improvement, while it can also be used as a forecasting tool in shaping transportation-oriented policies.",0965-8564,Not found
Modelling intra-household interactions in time-use and activity patterns of retired and dual-earner couples,10.1016/j.tra.2019.05.007,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The ageing population has become a global problem in which enhanced understanding on their activity-travel patterns is needed. In this paper, an analysis of retired and dual-earner couples is conducted to investigate how retirement would change their activity time use and patterns. In particular, intra-household interactions are considered, to explore the interdependencies among household members’ choices, social-demographics and travel behaviours. Household survey data from Hong Kong are employed. Results show that retirement would substantially increase joint participations and durations in various out-of-home activities. In addition, the importance of walkability is emphasised for retired couples in a mixed-land-use and transit-dependent city, and a potential social exclusion issue is identified for the low-income retired population. Scenarios analyses including changes of built environment and lifestyles (e.g., telecommuting, online shopping and food delivery) are conducted, to investigate how couples would reallocate the saved travel time. In summary, this paper highlights the importance of considering the group decision mechanism in a household for activity generation and travel demand forecasting.

The underlying effect of public transport reliability on users’ satisfaction,10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.004,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Service reliability has an important impact on the satisfaction stated by public transport users with the service they receive. The main source of unreliability is found in headway variance, which also affects waiting times and distributes passengers unevenly across vehicles. However, it is still unclear how headway irregularity, with its impact in waiting, crowdedness and reliability, affect travellers’ service satisfaction. Different stated preference studies have identified non-linear impacts produced by overcrowding. However, none of these studies is directly related to users’ satisfaction evaluation. In this study, we investigate the existence of this non-linearity in users’ satisfaction caused by both the crowding level and the number of denied boardings through a post-service satisfaction survey of bus and metro users. An Ordered Logit Model was estimated, accounting for sample heteroscedasticity and preference heterogeneity. Overall, there is a significant and negative perception of the bus mode, keeping all other attributes equal. For users under 35 years old, comfort experienced almost always plays an important role in service satisfaction, while for those over 35 years old women are significantly more sensitive to this attribute. Most important, crowding has a negative and non-linear impact on how passengers evaluate their travel satisfaction. Using a Likert-type scale, this curve is convex. This relationship between crowding and satisfaction might bias service planning and delivery if performance indicators associated to service are not properly weighted by the number of passengers served. Improving level of service indicators in this direction might provide public transport agencies a clearer and more accurate perception of the actual users’ experience.",0965-8564,Not found
A link criticality index embedded in the convex combinations solution of user equilibrium traffic assignment,10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.005,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Identification of critical components in transportation networks is an essential part of designing robust and resilient systems. Topological criticality measures are based on graph theory and are applicable in multiple domains including communication and socialnetworks. However, the non-linearity of link performance functions in transportation systems does not allow a perfect domain transfer of topological measures. Hence, transportation researchers take traffic flow characteristics into account while developing criticality measures. In such approaches, typically, a network performance measure is selected, then links are removed one-by-one, and traffic demand is reassigned to the updated network to calculate the impacts of each link failure. This consecutive link removal procedure requires multiple assignments which create a computational burden, especially for large networks. Overall objectives of this paper are (1) to compare and contrast selected criticality measures, and (2) to develop a new measure to identify critical components of transportation network, considering both traffic characteristics and network topology. For this purpose, the user equilibrium traffic assignment formulation is utilized, and the convex combinations solution algorithm is exploited for identification of link criticality ranking within a single traffic assignment. The developed measure is named Link Criticality Index (LCI). The LCI is compared with the existing measures in the literature through three numerical examples. Pros and cons of the LCI and selected measures are discussed in detail. The results indicate the proposed link criticality measure provides a balanced ranking with respect to connectivity/redundancy as well as the traffic conditions in the network.",0965-8564,Not found
Introducing autonomous buses and taxis: Quantifying the potential benefits in Japanese transportation systems,10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.003,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The introduction of autonomous buses and taxis is expected to generate such benefits as cost reductions—and particularly for regional bus operations with a substantial deficit—as well as enhancing public transit accessibility through decreased trip costs. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the impacts of introducing autonomous buses and taxis on metropolitan transportation systems by quantifying the costs of travel in Japan, and to discuss the potential benefits. First, this study sets the assumptions on autonomous driving technology, including its impacts on vehicle costs, the decreased labor costs for driving and safety monitoring in buses and taxis, and decreased driving stress for private car users. Next, operating costs are computed for autonomous buses and taxis in Japanese metropolitan areas. The costs of travel, or the sum of monetary and time costs, are then computed with and without vehicle automation for different trip types in high- and low-density metropolitan areas. The results highlight that the costs of public transit trips that currently have a smaller share of time costs in overall trip costs could decrease considerably due to vehicle automation. For instance, costs for 10–20-km trip lengths could decrease by 44–61% for taxi trips and 13–37% for rail/bus trips with taxi access, followed by a decrease of 6–11% for bus trips and 1–11% for rail trips with bus access. Further, private car trip costs could decrease by 11–16%. More substantial cost reductions in rail/bus trips with taxi access could occur in the case of smaller trip distances and/or in residential areas far from stations; larger reductions in rail trips with bus access could occur in low-density metropolitan areas. Finally, it is expected that vehicle automation in more fixed modes of public road transit could primarily benefit the transit industry and government, with such effects as improved labor productivity and reduced subsidies, while vehicle automation in more flexible modes could benefit metropolitan residents as well as the transit industry. This further suggests that a deficit of regional bus operations could be recovered during the transition to the full performance of autonomous buses.",0965-8564,Not found
"Use intention of mobility-management travel apps: The role of users goals, technophile attitude and community trust",10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.001,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"In recent years, persuasive interventions delivered through mobility-management tools have received attention as a means to motivate change for sustainable urban mobility. This paper aims to pinpoint and understand the drivers that influence individuals’ travel decisions when using travel apps including both travel information and persuasive features. The analytical framework relies on Lindenberg’s goal-framing theory in which individuals’ motives for using travel apps are grouped into three overarching goals, namely (1) gain, (2) hedonic and (3) normative goal-frames. Furthermore, technophile attitude, community trust and place attachment are incorporated into the framework in order to better explain user-sided heterogeneity. The case-study focuses on the travel information system under development in Copenhagen (Denmark). It questions 822 Danish travelers by distributing a technology-use preference survey. Structural equation models revealed that the choice motivators are specific to individual users and depend on wide ranging factors that go beyond traditional economic and socio-demographic methods. The study reveals: (i) trip efficiency improvement, enjoyment, social interaction and environmentally-friendly travel promotion are important motives for using the new app; (ii) individuals have different intentions according to the perceived value of the new information system as well as travel purposes; (iii) technophile attitude exerts a positive influence on both user motives and use intention; (iv) social and institutional trust in addition to an affective bond to the city influence the use intention of the travel app.",0965-8564,Not found

This study investigates the key drivers of satisfaction with public transport and their relationship with travel frequency and willingness to recommend public transport to others, hence contributing specifically by analysing the influence of social norms in travel use. A large-scale passenger satisfaction survey collected in six European cities and structural equation modelling validates the framework across different travel cultures. The study found that travel satisfaction is positively related to (i) accessibility measures, e.g. extent of network coverage, travel speed and service frequency, (ii) perceived costs, e.g. reasonable ticket prices, and (iii) norms, i.e. perceived societal and environmental importance of public transport. These findings were consistent across all six cities and across different user types based on use frequency of public transport and private car. Specifically, the willingness to recommend public transport to others was significantly related to public transport use at a similar level as overall satisfaction. Finally, the study found significant differences in satisfaction across respondents’ socio-economic characteristics as young respondents and students were less satisfied with service quality than middle-aged and elderly respondents despite more frequent use. This suggests structural problems in public transport because travel habits formed in early life shape travel behaviour throughout life. Hence, it is important to address the needs of these user groups to ensure public transport ridership in the future. The results bear important policy implications for planners in not only focusing on traditional measures for optimising operations, but also branding public transport as an environmentally and socially important transport mode in metropolitan areas.",0965-8564,Not found

Objective vs. subjective measures of street environments in pedestrian route choice behaviour: Discrepancy and correlates of non-concordance,10.1016/j.tra.2019.05.011,126,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Difficulties in obtaining detailed street environment data is identified as a major obstacle in pedestrian route choice studies. Scholars have used either objectively or subjectively measured street environment data without testing their suitability as a substitute for each other in the route choice literature. This study aims to overcome these gaps by investigating the relevance of subjective data as a less-expensive proxy for objective data—together with identifying the factors affecting the degree of disconcordance between them. Subjective street environment data was collected from 178 pedestrians in Brisbane, Australia. Participants were intercepted and requested to draw their walking routes. They were asked to rate the importance of different street environment attributes influencing the chosen route. A range of objective attributes of these routes was derived through virtual audit and spatial analyses. The concordance of 13 seemingly related street environment variables was tested using ‘Kappa coefficient’ and ‘% agreement’ methods. Additionally, 13 multinomial logistic regression models were estimated, one for each variable, to identify different factors affecting the level of disconcordance. Results indicate a relatively poor agreement between objective and subjective attributes. However, an objective provisioning of some attributes can improve the perception of pedestrians about these attributes. Estimated regression models show that all groups are to some extent at-risk of being mismatched, suggesting the need for population-based policy interventions to improve perceptions. Findings highlight that subjective measures capture different construct of the street environment than those measured objectively, hence, using these two measures are not comparable.",0965-8564,Not found

The results showed that high-speed rail had a negative effect on long-term population migration and significantly promoted short-term population mobility, leading to a negative effect on the population urbanisation; from the perspective of industrial structure, high-speed rail increased the proportion of the added value of the tertiary industry, promoted the upgrading of industrial structure, and consequently improved the quality of urbanisation.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact of high-speed rail network development on airport traffic and traffic distribution: Evidence from China and Japan,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.015,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"We explore the impacts of high-speed rail (HSR) development on airport-level traffic by considering not only the availability of air-HSR intermodal linkage between the airport and HSR station but also the position of the airport’s city in the HSR network. The latter is measured by both the degree centrality (to reflect connectivity) and the harmonic centrality (to reflect accessibility). Using a sample of 46 airports in China and a sample of 16 airports in Japan over the period of 2007–2015, we conduct regression analysis and compare the effects of HSR network development on airports in these two Northeast Asian countries. We find that as HSR connectivity or accessibility increases, there is, on average, a decline in airports’ domestic and total traffic in China but little change in Japan. Meanwhile, we observe a strong complementary effect of HSR to feed international flights with the presence of air-HSR intermodal linkage. As a result, some airports may experience a total traffic increase. In China, hub airports tend to gain traffic regardless the availability of air-HSR linkage, while non-hub airports are likely to lose. In Japan, on the other hand, airports with air-HSR linkage tend to gain traffic regardless the hub status. Our analysis also reveals some differentiated impacts of HSR connectivity and accessibility in China. An important policy implication is that the investment in air-HSR intermodal linkage at busy airports may not help with realizing the benefit of congestion mitigation and emission reduction. Rather, policy makers may invest air-HSR linkage at regional airports which have the potential to be converted into international gateway hubs.",0965-8564,Not found
Structured expert judgement to understand the intrinsic vulnerability of traffic networks,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.006,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"The concept of intrinsic vulnerability of a traffic network is defined for the first time in this paper. Intrinsic vulnerability is the susceptibility to incidents characterised by a probability of occurrence in space and time of difficult estimation, which can result in considerable reduction or loss of the system functionality. Given the nature of this type of vulnerability, its assessment might arise as a major problem. Therefore, this paper investigates the assessment of the intrinsic vulnerability of a traffic network through a set of quantifiable indicators, i.e., accessibility and reliability. Moreover, it is of interest to determine whether the selected indicators are sufficient to assess the intrinsic vulnerability or if there is any significant missing aspect to be considered. A new methodology based on structured elicitation of multivariate uncertainty from experts is presented to address these issues, allowing the estimation of the intrinsic vulnerability and its probabilistic relationship with the indicators accessibility and reliability. Although applied to the case of the metric intrinsic vulnerability, the proposed methodology emerges as an effective tool to understand other traffic descriptors of difficult evaluation such as resilience.",0965-8564,Not found
Analyzing the heterogeneous impacts of high-speed rail entry on air travel in China: A hierarchical panel regression approach,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.004,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"It has been widely recognized that the entry of high-speed rail (HSR) has significant impacts on air travel. Most, if not all, studies quantify such impacts using HSR entry dummy variables, namely, dummy variables that indicate the entry of HSR, in various econometric models. Although existing studies have attempted to explain the heterogeneity of the impacts of HSR entry, their approaches are often based on simple segmentation rules based on the distance between the origin and destination cities or whether the city pair involves a hub city. In this research, we use a systematic approach to analyze the heterogeneous impacts of HSR entry on air travel, which is new to the literature. Specifically, we take a hierarchical panel regression approach to analyze the Chinese domestic air travel data, which records, for each city pair, its monthly passenger volume and flight frequency from January 2011 to December 2017. We conduct data filtering and aggregation in the data preprocessing. At the lower level of our hierarchical model, we explore the heterogeneity of the coefficients for the HSR entry dummy variables and allow them to vary across city pairs; while at the upper level, we explain this heterogeneity using a structural equation that considers the difference of in-vehicle travel time between HSR and air travel, and the geo-economical characteristics of the origin and destination cities. Our main results include: (1) Consistent with existing literature, the entry of HSR reduces air passenger volumes and flight frequencies by 17.88% and 15.80%, respectively; (2) Strong heterogeneity exists in the impacts of HSR entry on both passenger volumes and flight frequencies; (3) For air passenger volumes, the impact of HSR entry intensifies at an accelerated rate when the difference of in-vehicle travel time between HSR and air decreases; (4) For air passenger volumes, the impact of HSR entry is stronger for city pairs that contain a hub city; (5) For air passenger volumes, the impact of HSR entry is smaller among city pairs that contain a western region city; (6) For flight frequencies, we find similar results, except that the factor of whether the city pair contains a hub city is non-significant; and (7) The determinants explain about 70% of heterogeneity of impacts of HSR entry on both the passenger volumes and flight frequencies.",0965-8564,Not found
Improving slot allocation at Level 3 airports,10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.014,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Most of the busiest airports outside the United States, including the major connecting hubs, are classified as Level 3.

Slot allocation is driven by a set of rules and priorities specified in the Worldwide Slot Guidelines (WSG) published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The process and rules for slot allocation at Level 3 airports carry enormous economic and regulatory implications for the global air transport sector. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the ongoing quest for improvements to the process that can be realistically implemented in practice. For that purpose, we have developed an optimization model, fully compliant with the WSG, for allocating airport slots to airlines and applied it at a few airports of varying sizes in Portugal, in order to compare the slot allocations performed by the coordinators with the best possible slot allocations under a variety of objectives and constraints, as well as to assess the impacts of potential changes to the WSG. The results obtained show that some even limited changes to the WSG can, on their own, bring considerable benefits in the short term to the slot allocation process.

Vulnerability analysis and critical area identification of public transport system: A case of high-speed rail and air transport coupling system in China,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.008,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"The public transport system (PTS) consists of different types of transport subsystems, such as high-speed rail (HSR), air transport (AT), conventional railway, expressway and waterway in a state, which exerts significant impacts on distribution of demographic and economic activities. And its interruption or failure may cause severe social and economic disruption. So the vulnerability analysis of the system attracts an increasing attention. However, most of previous researches mainly concentrate on the vulnerability modeling and analyzing of a single subsystem, neglecting the simultaneous interruption of components, and less considering the complementary effects of other subsystems from systematic perspective and the geographic interdependency among components. For trying to fill these gaps, this paper proposes a method to analyze the vulnerability of PTS composed of two or more transport subsystems and identity the critical area within the system based on the data of running timetable and position coordinates. Finally, taking HSR and AT coupling system in mainland China as a case study, we investigate the differences of vulnerability and critical areas between individual subsystem and overall system. Results reveal that the vulnerability variations and the critical areas distribution of the system are different from these of the subsystems. The research also finds that whether a component is critical depends not only on the system’s feature, but also on the component’s feature, whether an area is critical depends on economic development and population density of the area. These findings are beneficial to prioritize the plan, budget and maintenance of PTS, and prepare emergency response plans.",0965-8564,Not found
Applying a deep learning approach for transportation safety planning by using high-resolution transportation and land use data,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.010,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Analytical Transportation Safety Planning (TSP) is an important concept for integrating and improving both planning and safety and achieving better policies and decision making. In the recent decade, considerable efforts have been devoted to providing better prediction results with the consideration of zonal systems, mathematical methods, input variables, etc. In previous studies, transportation and land use data have been widely used as input to predict crashes. Meanwhile, the previous studies required all input variables to be aggregated at the zonal level. With the aggregation process, the collected data fell into low resolution and lost details, which may introduce low accuracy and even biases. The primary objective of this study is to validate the viability of applying a deep learning approach to predict crashes for TSP with the high-resolution data. A framework of collecting high-resolution data is first introduced. Then, a deep learning architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN) is adopted to predict traffic crashes. To validate the proposed method, an empirical study is conducted and the proposed method is compared with three counterparts: two statistical models (i.e., negative binomial model and spatial Poisson lognormal model) and a traditional machine learning model (i.e., artificial neural network) using low-resolution data (i.e., data that are aggregated based on zones). The results indicate that the proposed deep learning method with high-resolution data could provide significantly higher prediction accuracy than the three conventional models using low-resolution data, which validates the concept of using the deep learning approach with detailed data for traffic crash prediction. It is expected that the deep learning approach for traffic crash prediction in this study could provide new and valuable insights into the future directions of transportation safety planning.",0965-8564,Not found
Development and application of an iterative heuristic for roadway snow and ice control,10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.021,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Many states in the U.S. have experienced increased demand for roadway snow and ice control (RSIC) operations due to an increase in extreme winter weather. As the number and severity of extreme weather events increases, the costs associated with winter roadway maintenance materials, plow operator time, equipment maintenance and replacement, and fuel use will also increase. In this paper, we introduce a unique heuristic procedure which we combine with real-world operational constraints to advance both the modeling and practical application of RSIC operations by incorporating a continuous measure of priority into a sequenced, iterative heuristic for network clustering, vehicle allocation, and capacitated vehicle routing. The heuristic balances the competing objectives of minimizing the total vehicle hours traveled for the fleet and minimizing the total time required to service the most critical links in the roadway network, while ensuring that the entire fleet is put to use. We also introduce a new measure of route-system performance, which is based on an effective link length (adjusted for how critical the link is to the performance of the entire system) and the time it takes to service the most critical links. We demonstrate the approach in practice by running five different applications of the heuristic on the statewide roadway network in Vermont. We demonstrate conclusively that our heuristic is effective for servicing the most critical links in the network in the least amount of time. We show that our more advanced vehicle allocation methods result in more effective RSIC service operations than adding vehicles to the fleet.",0965-8564,Not found
Attitudes towards autonomous vehicles among people with physical disabilities,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.002,127,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a technological revolution in the transportation sphere. The efficient and orderly introduction of AVs will require their acceptance by the public. Although the perspectives of members of the general public concerning AVs have been surveyed, no academic research has to date been completed on the views of AVs held by people with disabilities. The present study employs a mixed methods research methodology to assess attitudes towards AVs among a UK sample of individuals with physical disabilities that affected their mobility. Participants were asked open-endedly to express their thoughts about AVs and their responses were analysed using a structural topic modelling (STM) procedure. Outputs to the STM analysis were then employed in a structural equation model (SEM) constructed to predict the sample members’ willingness to travel in driverless vehicles. The results were compared against those obtained from a control group of people without physical disabilities. The attitudes towards AVs of people with disabilities differed significantly from the attitudes of the respondents without disabilities. Attitudes towards AVs among people with disabilities were significantly influenced by their levels of interest in new technology, generalised anxiety, intensity of a person’s disability, prior knowledge of AVs, locus of control and action orientation. A latent class analysis confirmed the relevance of these variables as determinants of the views of people with disabilities regarding AVs.",0965-8564,Not found

A distinguishing novelty of the proposed approach is that it can inherently be applied both at local and coordinated levels. The proposed strategy is based on a recently developed nonlinear adaptive control scheme, consisting of a nominal feedback law in conjunction with a nonlinear observer, which aims to estimate some unknown system variables. The present study provides insights into and demonstrates the properties and the performance of the proposed methodology, which is tested for realistic traffic scenarios using a macroscopic traffic flow simulator as a surrogate for potential field application.

The effect of paid parking and bicycle subsidies on employees’ parking demand,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.007,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Employers usually offer free parking to employees, which may lead to welfare losses. Using exogenous variation in daily peak-hour parking tariffs, monthly subscription fees and bicycle subsidies faced by hospital employees, we demonstrate that employees’ parking demand is reduced by about 5 percent for every euro per-day tariff increase, and that it is reduced by about 2 percent for every euro subscription fee increase. The introduction of higher parking prices particularly reduced demand during peak hours. We offer compelling evidence that bicycle subsidies reduce parking demand. Hospitals that offer free parking to employees, but then introduce a parking tariff equal to marginal parking costs, induce modest yearly welfare gains of € 60 per parking space, about 8 percent of parking resource costs. This is slightly less than previously found in the literature.",0965-8564,Not found

The technique proposed in this study was applied to the proposed surface rapid transit network for the Metropolitan Area of Tel Aviv. For this research a bi-modal model of the spatial structure, which includes the street network as well as the planned rapid transit routes, was analyzed. The results show that that a substantial share of the network’s alignment can be described solely by measuring through-movement potentials. This finding demonstrates the significant role of spatial accessibility analysis in transit planning. Consequently, this study provides a reproducible methodology for identifying the routes which hold the highest potential to serve as strategic movement corridors at a metropolitan scale, thus improving current RTS (Rapid Transit System) planning practice.",0965-8564,Not found
Steering towards happiness: An experience sampling study on the determinants of happiness of truck drivers,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.017,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"The relatively low levels of employee well-being reported among truck drivers directly relate to some of the key challenges faced in the transportation industry, including high turnover of staff and difficulties attracting people to the profession. Drawing on the job demands-resources model, this study addresses this problem by examining how various state-like and trait-like job demands and resources relate to truck drivers’ momentary happiness at work. Using an experience sampling study comprising 82 Dutch truck drivers, truck drivers were found to be happier during off-job activities and non-work-related job activities, such as breaks, than during work-related job activities. Furthermore, this study shows that road congestion aggravates the inverse relationship between work-related job activities and momentary happiness. Social support of colleagues and flexible work hours alleviate this relationship.

"Effect of built environment on shared bicycle reallocation: A case study on Nanjing, China",10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.018,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Shared bicycles provide a convenient mobility option to commuters especially for short-distance trips. Nevertheless, it also presents a challenge to bicycle-sharing operators as they have to deal with reallocation issues, i.e. removing bicycles from parking facilities which are at or near capacity and refilling parking facilities that are in need of bicycles. Few studies in the literature have actually tried understanding why certain docking stations are prone to excessive demand or suffer from a lack of parking supply. This paper attempts to identify the demographic, built-environment and transport-infrastructure indicators that can potentially aid policy-makers and operators in identifying parking facilities prone to bicycle reallocation. In particular, we have adopted the bicycle sharing operations in Nanjing, China as a case study to understand how such indicators can be identified for appropriate parking infrastructural enhancements. To achieve this goal, this study has established zero-inflated negative binomial models using multi-source data including point-of-interest (POI), daily weather, transit stop location, demographic data and bike-share smart card data. The model results obtained from this study suggest that built environment correlates significantly to shared bicycle reallocation count. In general, bicycle docking stations with large reallocation counts are more likely to be found near residences, bus stops, metro stations, employment areas, restaurants, amenities, parks, sports facilities, and clinics/hospitals; while stations near entertainment facilities, places of attraction, hotels, shopping malls, and educational institution tend to have balanced demand and supply. Analysis on the elasticity values revealed that mean temperature and station capacity are the most influential factors in bicycle reallocation. Among all POIs, presence of restaurants and areas with high employment tend to exhibit strongly a need for morning bicycle removal and evening bicycle refilling at docked stations. Policy makers can provide actual guidelines in the planning of shared bicycle parking facilities using the findings and methodologies presented in this study.",0965-8564,Not found
Increasing cycling for transportation through mentorship programs,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.014,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Policy statements and planning documents of many North American municipalities recognize the benefits of increased cycling, however, rates of bicycling for transport remain low and programming interventions have been limited and rarely rigorously evaluated. We investigate the impact of four cycling mentorship interventions based in non-cycling partner organizations on: cycling behaviour, attitudes towards cycling, and willingness to spend on bicycles and accessories. Residents, mostly newcomers to Canada, participated in 12–16 week cycling mentorship programs, involving personal support from an experienced cyclist. They were provided with safety training, bicycles, locks and helmets and publicly committed to participate in the program. 146 of the 197 participants completed entry and exit surveys. At program exit each participant cycled on average an additional 1.8 days per week to shopping (p ≤ 0.001) and an additional 1.35 days per week to work and school (p ≤ 0.001) compared to program entry. At program exit, participants were willing to spend 23% more on a bicycle and 32% more (p < 0.01) on accessories like carriers, helmets and locks. They were more confident about the rules of the road and were aware of safe streets for riding in their neighbourhood. They were less confident of finding a safe route and more aware of the relative rarity of women cyclists. The programs were effective in increasing cycling for transport regardless of the distance people lived from their respective central business district. These results are promising and suggest that with sufficient support people will bicycle in neighbourhoods throughout the region. Increased availability of cycling infrastructure would likely increase confidence in finding a safe route and improve these results.",0965-8564,Not found
A fast reaction-based port vulnerability assessment: Case of Tianjin Port explosion,10.1016/j.tra.2019.05.019,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"There has been a growing international attention on port catastrophes after the 2015 Tianjin Port explosion, which calls for a realistic yet effective method to assess seaports’ vulnerability. However, quantitative vulnerability analysis of ports during the initial post-disaster stage by traditional methods reveals challenges due to the scarcity of data and the inoperability in treating diverse data formations in a utility vulnerability inference mechanism. Thus, this study proposes a fast reaction-based port vulnerability assessment framework (FRPVA) which allows the quantification of ex-post port vulnerability. The fuzzy evidential reasoning (ER) approach and the fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are embedded in the proposed framework. The FRPVA framework is applied to the case of the 2015 Tianjin Port explosion in two assessment periods – one day and four months after the explosion. Our results show that (1) the collection and distribution system as well as the storage system are bottlenecks of the Tianjin Port; (2) the storage system is the most vulnerable among the four assessment units in both assessment periods; (3) after four months’ recovery, the vulnerability condition of the loading and unloading system improves the most comparing to other three assessment units. Outputs of this framework can be useful references for various port stakeholders in prioritizing protected targets, planning routes, as well as for (re)insurance companies as a part of the catastrophe modeling.",0965-8564,Not found
Spatial interaction effects on inland distribution of maritime flows,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.012,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"The relationship between the regional economy and the infrastructure endowment has long been discussed in the literature. In this context, it can be said that ports play an important role for regions, as they affect their competitiveness, while the regional economic activity has an effect on port traffic. Both circumstances influence the inland distribution of maritime traffic and are interconnected by the configuration of the hinterland of ports. The hypothesis of this paper is that spatial interaction effects, both exogenous and endogenous, shape the inter-port distribution of maritime traffic. The endogenous interaction effect arises when the inter-port distribution of the flows is influenced by those of nearby regions, whereas the exogenous interaction effect appears when the circumstances of these neighbours affect the flows generated by the region considered. The inter-port distribution of Spanish maritime flows of foreign trade for the period 1995–2015 was analysed in order to confirm the validity of this hypothesis. To that end, the Spatial Econometric Interaction Modelling (SEIM) framework was followed, and a Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) to origin-destination flows was applied. The results confirm that endogenous and exogenous interaction effects impact the inland distribution of the Spanish container flows and reveal the existence of direct and network effects regarding the variables analysed.",0965-8564,Not found
Characterizing and measuring transportation infrastructure diversity through linkages with ecological stability theory,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.013,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Transportation infrastructure is critical to any community. Disturbances such as natural hazards can hinder transportation infrastructure performance impacting a community’s quality of life through disruptions in service and effects on interdependent systems. Ecological systems are robust and resilient and have similarities with infrastructure systems. Diversity is a fundamental element of ecological resilience and is recognized as an important factor in transportation resilience. However, measures of transportation diversity are not well-developed. Accordingly, this paper adapts the ecological diversity concepts of richness and evenness to develop an approach to characterize transportation system diversity and distinguishes the approach from existing methods. Measures of transportation functional richness and evenness are derived and applied to New York City at the zip code level. The results facilitate identification of zip codes in New York City with varying levels of transportation diversity. Those zip codes with low diversity generally have limited availability (low richness) and disproportionate distribution (low evenness) of alternative transportation modes. Further, these zip codes are potentially susceptible to system disturbances as a consequence of routine disruptions or natural hazards. For instance, many low diversity zip codes are in hurricane evacuation zones. Limited complementarity in the transportation system of these zip codes will likely impact evacuations during hurricanes and recovery to pre-disturbance performance levels. Ultimately, the transportation diversity approach presented should lead to better understanding of transportation system characteristics such as inherent and augmented complementarity, which will enhance transportation system performance in urban communities.",0965-8564,Not found
Barriers to investing in cycling: Stakeholder views from England,10.1016/j.tra.2017.11.003,128,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Background Planners and politicians in many countries seek to increase the proportion of trips made by cycling. However, this is often challenging. In England, a national target to double cycling by 2025 is likely to be missed: between 2001 and 2011 the proportion of commutes made by cycling barely grew. One important contributory factor is continued low investment in cycling infrastructure, by comparison to European leaders. Methods This paper examines barriers to cycling investment, considering that these need to be better understood to understand failures to increase cycling level. It is based on qualitative data from an online survey of over 400 stakeholders, alongside seven in-depth interviews. Results Many respondents reported that change continues to be blocked by chronic barriers including a lack of funding and leadership. Participants provided insights into how challenges develop along the life of a scheme. In authorities with little consideration given to cycling provision, media and public opposition were not reported as a major issue.

"Urban form, travel behavior, and travel satisfaction",10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.002,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The relationship between the built environment and travel satisfaction has not been adequately explored in previous research. This study examines how urban form affects travel satisfaction using survey and interview data from Oslo metropolitan area, which is a good case for such a study since compact and sprawled urban forms are found to a large extent in the same city region. Results suggest that commute satisfaction as well as leisure travel satisfaction are significantly higher for residents of compact urban neighborhoods than those of sprawled suburbs. The article further focuses on commute satisfaction and finds that this difference is mainly due to differences in (a) trip duration and (b) travel modal split between the two urban form types. (a) Shorter distances to the city center and higher neighborhood densities are associated with significantly lower trip duration to work or education. This lower trip duration experienced by compact-city residents significantly contributes to their higher travel satisfaction. (b) Significant differences in the impact of travel mode on travel satisfaction, controlling for trip duration, are found. From most to least pleasant, travel modes are evaluated as follows: (1) walk, (2) bike and train, (3) bus, tram and metro, and (4) car. These differences contribute to the higher travel satisfaction found in compact neighborhoods, since residents of compact neighborhoods use active travel modes (walking and cycling) to a high extent and the car to a low extent, while suburban residents walk and cycle significantly less and use the car significantly more. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that compact-city policies and car restrictions that are currently applied or planned to be applied in several cities worldwide can have a positive impact on travel satisfaction as they lead to shorter trip durations and more active travel compared with urban sprawl policies.",0965-8564,Not found
Evaluating challenges to implementing eco-innovation for freight logistics sustainability in Nigeria,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.001,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Globally, even as environmental protection and sustainability are becoming increasingly important, freight transportation firms are faced with the enormous need to reduce the significant environmental burdens that accrue from transport vehicles. Eco-innovation can aid freight transport firms through fostering sustainable transportation alternatives at best possible costs to ensure effective decision- making for freight logistics sustainability. Yet, freight logistics companies are faced with numerous difficulties when attempting to implement eco-innovation practices along their supply chains. This paper therefore identifies the challenges to implementing eco-innovation practices for freight logistics sustainability to aid management to take informed decisions to overcome these challenges before the environmental burdens become critical. The Best- Worst method is adopted to evaluate and rank these challenges in terms of their relative importance in Nigeria, an emerging economy, which is characterized by increased consumption due to huge population size coupled with government green requirements. The results depict that unavailable funds, lack of clarity on the financial benefits of eco-innovation practices, poor technology infrastructure and reluctant attitude towards eco-innovation practices are the most pressing challenges amongst the challenges faced by Nigeria freight logistics companies.

The effectiveness of managed lane strategies for the near-term deployment of cooperative adaptive cruise control,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.015,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Traffic simulation is a cost-effective way to test the deployment of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) vehicles in a large-scale transportation network. By using a previously developed microscopic simulation testbed, this paper examines the impacts of four managed lane strategies for the near-term deployment of CACC vehicles under mixed traffic conditions. Network-wide performance measures are investigated from the perspectives of mobility, safety, equity, and environmental impacts. In addition, the platoon formation performance of CACC vehicles is evaluated with platoon-orientated measures, such as the percentage of platooned CACC vehicles, average platoon depth, and vehicle-hour-platooned that is proposed in this paper under the imperfect DSRC communication environment. Moreover, managed lane score matrices are developed to incorporate heterogeneous categories of performance measures, aiming to provide a more comprehensive picture for stakeholders. The results show that mixing CACC traffic along with non-CACC traffic across all travel lanes is an acceptable option when the market penetration (MP) is lower than 30% for roadways where a managed lane is absent. Providing CACC with priority access to an existing managed lane, if available, is also a good strategy for improving the overall traffic performance when the MP is lower than 40%. When the MP reaches above 40%, a dedicated lane for CACC vehicles is recommended, as it provides greater opportunity for CACC vehicles to form platoons. The facilitation of homogeneous CACC traffic flow could make further improvements possible in the future.",0965-8564,Not found

We use a latent class model to identify heterogenous classes of autopilot users, then we use a multinomial logistic regression model to understand the relationship between each latent class and several independent variables, including socio-demographics and vehicle miles travelled (VMT). The latent class model revealed four latent classes: very frequent users, who use it most frequently; frequent users, who use automation frequently in clear weather and on freeways; semi-frequent users who use it for less than half their trips and only on freeways, in clear weather, when there is no traffic; and infrequent users, who use it the least often and only in clear weather, on freeways, when there is no traffic.

We evaluate the value of the geographical switching option for three cases: the upper bound based on having perfect foresight, the baseline set by a random strategy, and the case of perfect foresight but only for a limited time horizon. By combining a neural network with optimization, we can assess the impact of varying foresight horizons on economic performance. In a simple but realistic two-region case, we evaluate empirically that the upper bound for large vessels can be as high as 25% cumulative outperformance, and that a significant portion of this theoretical value can be captured with limited foresight of a few weeks.

Two model specifications, in which consideration for the slower alternatives is measured using both sets of supplementary questions, are proposed and contrasted against a model which assumes all alternatives are considered. Our results suggests that some of the unobserved preference heterogeneity could potentially be due to consideration effects.

What does Tesla mean to car buyers? Exploring the role of automotive brand in perceptions of battery electric vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.006,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Among the broad literature on consumer research of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), the role of brand perceptions is neglected. Consumers may gravitate towards automotive brands that they are accustomed to (“brand loyalty”), or they might prefer a new brand (i.e., Tesla) for being new and innovative (“pioneer brand advantage”). Further, BEV-supportive policies may indirectly favor or disfavor the BEVs produced by a given brand. We explore consumer perceptions of automotive brand perceptions in general, and for the specific case of Tesla, using survey data from a representative sample of 2123 Canadian new vehicle-buyers collected in 2017. Respondents most frequently associate BEVs with Tesla (27%), Toyota (27%), and Chevrolet (26%). Over two-thirds of respondents are familiar with Tesla, and 40% select Tesla as a brand representing the “future of BEVs”. In contrast, when asked which brand they would prefer to buy a BEV from, responses are more evenly spread across several brands, with 30% of respondents selecting a brand they already own. Of Tesla-familiar respondents, most indicate that Tesla has influenced them to perceive BEVs as more innovative, stylish, and environmentally-beneficial. Respondents have stronger image associations with Tesla, relative to BEVs more generally, and such perceptions are statistically associated with stated interest in purchasing a BEV. These exploratory findings indicate the potential importance of brand in shaping consumer perceptions of BEVs. Tesla in particular may have played a role in developing positive perceptions of BEVs, suggesting that it might be desirable for policy to support such a brand.",0965-8564,Not found
Assessing the effect of autonomous driving on value of travel time savings: A comparison between current and future preferences,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.011,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Due to digitalization trends and rapid technological development, cars are becoming more technologically advanced with an on-going trend towards fully automated vehicles. Understanding possible changes in user preferences and the impact on mobility of autonomous driving is of great importance for policy and transport planning authorities in light of urbanization trends, demographic change, and environmental challenges. Despite the relevance of the topic, there are limited empirical insights on user preferences, once autonomous driving becomes available. To close this gap and analyze the potential changes in the value of travel time savings (VTTS) resulting from the availability of autonomous driving, an online survey using revealed and stated preference methods was conducted. In the survey user preferences toward currently available and future available modes of transportation were assessed using two discrete choice experiments. VTTS calculations are based on an estimated joint mixed logit model. The results of the study show an average VTTS reduction of 41% for autonomous driving compared to driving a conventional car, however, only for commuting trips. For leisure or shopping trips, no significant changes in the VTTS were found. Considering shared autonomous vehicles (SAV), the results indicate that using SAV is perceived as a less attractive option than using a privately owned autonomous vehicle. Translating the results into policy implications, a potential conflict between individual benefits of autonomous driving and societal goals is identified. Finally, policy recommendations are discussed.",0965-8564,Not found
Mode choice modelling for hailable rides: An investigation of the competition of Uber with other modes by using an integrated non-compensatory choice model with probabilistic choice set formation,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.014,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"This paper presents an empirical investigation on demand for TNC services (e.g., Uber) in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Areas (GTHA) through the application of an innovative discrete choice model. The proposed model combines Independent Availability Logit (IAL) and Constrained Multinomial Logit (CMNL) model formulation to reap the unique features of both. The proposed model is thus a Semi Compensatory Independent Availability Logit (SCIAL) model. For the empirical investigation, it uses a dataset of trip mode choices that suitable to represent ride-hailing service (e.g., Uber). Such trips are named as hailable trips in the dataset, which is drawn from a large scale household travel survey conducted in the region in 2016. To have a clear understanding of behavioural processes involved in the choice of travel mode of hailable trips, the proposed SCIAL model jointly models probabilistic choice set formation and conditional semi-compensatory choice. The empirical model does not reveal any evident competition between Uber and the private car, public transit, or non-motorized modes. It indicates that urban taxi is its main competitor, but there are notable differences in socio-demographic profiles of taxi and Uber users. For example, a taxi is preferred by older people, but younger people prefer uber, and there is no gender difference in such a pattern. In terms of the relationship between considering Uber as a feasible mode and choosing it for a trip, Uber has similarities to the car passenger mode. Merely accepting it as a feasible option has a significant influence on the final choice to use it.

The case of Milan,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.005,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Milan is one of the few cities in Europe where a congestion charge is in place. It was experimentally introduced at the beginning of 2008 as a pollution charge to enter the central area of Milan. During 2011, to confirm it and also to extend its scope, a city-wide referendum took place. Referendum results largely supported the extension. While we know well the economic rationale and the potential effects of such policies, the issue of acceptability is still quite unexplored and usually studied with limited interview campaigns, focus groups or theoretical assumptions. This referendum is an interesting occasion to study the real motivations of the acceptability of road pricing experiences in a consolidated context. This paper studies the determinants of the highly positive vote in favour of the extension of the former pollution charge into a congestion charge scheme. The scale of analysis is the aggregate result of the referendum at the neighbourhood level. The variables studied are the ideological orientation, some socio-economic variables, and the distance from the city centre. In contrast to the majority of existing literature, we also include in the analysis the effect of transport supply and previous mobility patterns, in order to verify if they were crucial to the voters’ acceptance of a road charge.",0965-8564,Not found
Train path congestion management: Using hybrid auctions for decentralized railway capacity allocation,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.013,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Despite the entry of new competitors into the railway market in European countries, the capacity allocation mechanism still relies on the same service priority criteria as before the adoption of 91/440/EEC Directive. Without the implementation of a market-based mechanism or criteria, the current administrative approach of network capacity allocation inhibits further development of competition and especially freight railway transport. In this paper, the application of auctions is limited to a part of railway infrastructure. In view of the specificities of the railway sector and the nature of infrastructure capacity, the following question can be raised: Are there auction mechanisms that reduce the likelihood of collusion and at the same time achieve a high degree of efficiency of capacity allocation? In such a context, this article considers the implementation of hybrid auctions for the purpose of train path allocation. In order to facilitate the implementation of various types of auctions in allocation procedure on railways, this paper develops and models an algorithm for iterative train paths allocation. With the proposed algorithm, the auction outcomes have been determined in a simulation with the objective of comparing the performances of hybrid (two-phase) auctions: Anglo-Dutch and second-price Amsterdam auction with some well-known standard-type auctions: English and sealed-bid first-price auction. The results indicate that hybrid auctions are a better choice in European conditions when railway undertakers are asymmetric, especially if there is a threat of collusion. These results could help an IMs to decide which type of auction mechanism to choose for the railway capacity allocation.",0965-8564,Not found
Cycling comfort evaluation with instrumented probe bicycle,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.009,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The cycling comfort level of different cycling infrastructure can strongly influence the comfort perception of cyclists and their route choices. In this paper, the cycling comfort index (CCI) is used to measure the cycling comfort level on cycling infrastructure and describe different cycle track characteristics. An Instrumented Probe Bicycle (IPB), which is equipped with a video camera and a set of sensors including GPS receiver, accelerometer, etc., is employed to collect data while being ridden by cyclist in Singapore. An automatic video processing technique using convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied, such that no direct field measurement is required and the data collection process is less time-consuming. Video-based survey is carried out to capture the correlation between CCI and the comfort perception of cyclists. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) method is employed to build the CCI model dependent on various explanatory variables and survey participants’ ratings. The results show that the overall accuracy of the XGBoost method is 11% higher than the ordered Probit model commonly used in literature.",0965-8564,Not found
Efficiency measure on the truck restriction policy in China: A non-radial data envelopment model,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.010,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The paper reports results from a use of non-radial DEA i.e., range adjusted measure (RAM) which belongs to data envelopment analysis to evaluate the performances of the truck restriction policy in China. We try to explore what is inside the “black box” on the restriction policy by empirical study. Using the non-radial DEA model, we work with an approach that allows a flexible designation of three input variables and two output variables based on varying perspectives in China. The multipurpose approach reveals whether one policy is truly beneficial instead of officials’ arguments, captured in the form of DEA scores. The modified model can better reflect macro-transportation process while earlier relevant models ignored truckers. This paper contributes to increasing traffic volumes and decreasing traffic accidents from the point of technical efficiency. The results of our paper reveal that: (a) China's truck restriction policies have achieved a significant “level effect” on efficiency improvement. (b) There are remarkable provincial differences in the effectiveness of the restriction policy. (c) Slack decomposition shows that excessive investment is the main source of inefficiency. Moreover, we delivery policy implications that: (a) the restriction policies greatly contribute to the efficiencies, and stringent policies are still needed in the following days; (b) the policy-making should suit local conditions, according to our classification of 30 provinces; (c) based on the worst performance of capital stock variable, the authorities should focus more on regulation of investment in transportation sector at a latter stage.",0965-8564,Not found
Has the relationship between urban and suburban automobile travel changed across generations?

At the age of 16–28 years old, Millennials have lower daily personal vehicle miles traveled and car trips than Gen Xers in urban (higher-density) and suburban (lower-density) neighborhoods. Such differences remain unchanged after adjusting for the socio-economic, vehicle ownership, life cycle, year-specific and regional-specific factors. In addition, the associations between residential density and automobile travel for the 16–28-year-old Millennials are flatter than that for Gen Xers, controlling for the aforementioned covariates. These generational differences remain for the 24–36-year-old Millennials, during the period when the U.S. economy was recovering from the recession. These findings show that, in both urban and suburban neighborhoods, Millennials in the U.S. are less auto-centric than the previous generation during early life stages, regardless of economic conditions.

Welfare effects of open access competition on railway markets,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.005,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"In recent years, several countries have deregulated passenger railway markets to allow open access. The aim is for competition to lower fares and increase quality of service, thereby increasing demand, economic efficiency and overall social welfare. We use a stylised simulation model to study how open access competition affects fares, demand, supply, consumer surplus and operator profits compared to a profit maximising monopoly and to a welfare maximising benchmark situation. We conclude that aggregate social welfare increases substantially when going from profit maximising monopoly to duopoly competition, as consumers make large gains while operators’ profits fall. It matters how the infrastructure manager sets the timetable based on operators’ capacity requests: the infrastructure manager should strive to increase competition by mixing competing operators’ departures as much as possible. According to simulations, there generally exists a stable competitive Nash equilibrium with two or more profitable operators. Although operators are identical in the model setup, the Nash equilibrium outcome is asymmetric: one operator has more departures and higher average fares than the other does. If operators are allowed to cooperate, however, for example by trading or selling departure slots, the equilibrium situation tends to revert to monopoly. The regulatory framework must therefore prevent collusion and facilitate market entry. Even the potential for competitive entry tends to increase social welfare, as the monopolist has incentives to increase supply as an entry deterrence strategy.",0965-8564,Not found
Bikeway prioritization to increase bicycle network connectivity and bicycle-transit connection: A multi-criteria decision analysis approach,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.003,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Due to limited resources such as budget and land space, it remains challenging to identify key prior corridors on which investments on bikeways (e.g., traditional and protected bike lanes) are most valuable to increasing low-stress bike network connectivity and bicycle-transit connection. In built-up urban areas, it’s usually difficult to find the extra space for building bikeways, and vehicle delays could be worse off if there is no road widening. Facing these challenges, the paper introduces a systematic planning analytics aiming to increase bicycle connectivity and bicycle-transit connection with minimized impacts on motor vehicles and cost. The stakeholders concerned include bicyclists, transit users, motor vehicle drivers, and investors. To reduce conflict potentials due to multiple factors involved in decision making choices between stakeholders, a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) technique is applied to compare alternatives based on a set of performance evaluation criteria. Performance criteria include bicycling connectivity between origins and destinations, bike share connectivity to destinations, bicycle-transit service coverage population, bike share connectivity to transit, automobile traffic delay, and capital costs. Criteria weights are determined by pair-wise comparisons in which the conflicts between stakeholders and trade-offs among criteria are considered in a quantity-based method. A final preference score calculated in the sum of the weighted and normalized performance measurements is used to rank alternatives. The approach is applied through a case study in the Uptown Cincinnati, Ohio to determine the priorities of the proposed new bikeways in the area. The results indicate that the protected bike lanes exhibit a more significant advantage over bike lanes in terms of the benefits for bicyclists and transit users. At the same time, however, higher construction cost and countermeasures to reduce the potential of consequent traffic congestion need to be need carefully considered.",0965-8564,Not found
Modelling preferences towards activities and their effect on departure time choices,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.004,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"A great challenge that comes with cities’ growth and urbanization is how to transport their inhabitants efficiently. Since available urban space has been progressively reducing, the attention has shifted from capacity investment to transport demand management. As a result, policies aimed at changing departure time choices have arisen. To properly analyze such policies, it is necessary to understand how and when people prefer to travel, which is a result of the activities individuals perform. This paper studies preferences towards activities to be conducted and the impact of these preferences on departure time choices. For this purpose, a stated preference survey was developed to reproduce a daily activity pattern for all respondents. With the collected data it was possible to compare alternative approaches to model activities proposed in the literature. This comparison shows that traditional formulations to model activities preferences might not be the ideal in some cases. Instead, the use of more complex formulations, such as sigmoidal functions, is encouraged since they could adequately represent the preferences regarding activity's duration and time of day, as well as activity's flexibility. Results show that activities to be conducted before and after each trip affect the departure time choices and should be considered when modelling and forecasting travel demand. Therefore, a proper benefit estimation from travel time savings should include a direct and indirect component: one related to avoid travelling (which is an undesired activity by itself) and another one related to the increase of available time to perform activities instead of travelling. Our results show that if the latter effect is not included, the value of mean travel time would be underestimated by 38% and total benefits could be miscalculated.",0965-8564,Not found
Public opinion about automated vehicles in Australia: Results from a large-scale national survey,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.002,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Public acceptability, and ultimately acceptance, of automated vehicles (AVs) is critical in order to ensure that drivers utilise them and thus realise their predicted safety and other benefits. The aim of this study was to gauge public acceptability and opinions of AVs within an Australian context, for which there is currently a scarcity of empirical research. The study employed a national sample of 5089 respondents who responded to a large online survey (including 45 items specifically targeting aspects of AV acceptability). Survey items gauged demographic and other sample characteristics, and probed responses to questions on key issues including (a) the perceived benefits of AVs, (b) sources, and degree, of concerns regarding AV-related issues, and (c) willingness to pay for AV technology. Overall, it was found that, even though Australian respondents tended to agree with many of the potential benefits of AVs probed in the survey, they have considerable concerns regarding many AV-related issues. Furthermore, a majority of Australians are currently not willing to pay any more for a fully autonomous vehicle than for a manually operated vehicle. Results also showed that a number of sample demographic and characteristic variables (e.g., gender, self-classification as an early vs. late adopter of technology) have unique associations with aspects of AV acceptability. Important theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.",0965-8564,Not found
The structure of public-private sector collaboration in travel information markets: A game theoretic analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.001,129,2019-11-01,2019,11,"In recent years there has been substantial growth in the prevalence of ad-hoc data exchange arrangements between local traffic authorities and commercial traffic information service providers. Although these arrangements are widely regarded as mutually beneficial, in fact to date, no comprehensive analysis exists of the operation of this information market, nor of its consequences for the different market participants involved. To address this gap, this paper presents a new framework which enables the analysis of the long-term outcomes of various collaboration schemes for traffic information service providers, local traffic authorities and network users. The framework is based on a bi-level non-cooperative Nash game in which the upper level represents the data exchange arrangements between local traffic authorities and commercial traffic information service providers and the lower level represents the impact of the provided information services on network users. The framework is flexible and can accommodate a variety of different market structures and commercial behaviours. The game theoretic model is formulated and solved as an equivalent equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints. Numerical experiments are undertaken using this framework to explore the consequence of a number of commonly observed real-world data exchange arrangements. This analysis leads to three general conclusions. First, the results suggest that when a local traffic authority seeks only to minimise the total network travel time and offers free collaboration schemes, it should collaborate with all the cooperating service providers in the market. Second, if conversely, a local traffic authority seeks only to maximise its revenue from selling its data to service providers, it should be aware that its revenue does not always increase by selling the data to more service providers, since the willingness of service providers to pay for data declines as more providers are granted access. And finally, if a local traffic authority seeks to establish paid schemes that balance the benefit to network users and its own revenue benefits, then circumstances can easily arise in which these two objectives are in conflict with one another.",0965-8564,Not found
Optimizing decision-making of regional cold chain logistics system in view of low-carbon economy,10.1016/j.tra.2019.10.004,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"With the increasing demand for low-carbon cold chain logistics, corresponding subsidy policy and carbon emissions trading policy are needed to guide cold chain logistics enterprises in energy-saving and emission reduction transformation of cold storage. However, current research mainly focuses on energy-saving and emission reduction through improving the energy efficiency of equipment or optimizing the operation and management of cold chain logistics enterprises, rarely considering the government policy. This paper constructs a decision-making model of cold chain logistics system by using the method of bilevel programming. The upper level is the government's goal, pursuing the total cost minimization of the whole cold chain logistics system. The lower level is the goal of the cold chain logistics enterprise, pursuing the cost minimization of the enterprise. Chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) was developed to improve this model, and this method was applied to the decision-making of cold chain logistics system in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The study reveals: (1) The joint use of carbon emission reduction subsidies and carbon emission quota optimization measures is more effective in promoting energy-saving and emission reduction of enterprises than using them separately; (2) The carbon emission quota set by the government should not be too high or too low; (3) The government subsidy limits for carbon emission reduction have a significant impact on the carbon emission reduction of enterprises; (4) The subsidy rate per unit carbon emission reduction can adjust the total carbon emissions and total carbon emission reduction of enterprises. This study provides a scientific basis and inspires the government and enterprise in decision-making to improve the energy-saving and emission reduction of the whole society.",0965-8564,Not found
Scheduled block time setting and on-time performance of U.S. and Chinese airlines—A comparative analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.043,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Scheduled block time (SBT) is the duration between scheduled departure time and scheduled arrival time of a given flight. SBTs have a significant impact on airline operations and performance, and airlines consider various factors in setting them. Recent studies have proposed several models for understanding U.S. airlines’ SBT-setting behavior and have examined the contribution of SBT-setting to airline on-time performance (OTP). How airlines in different countries and regions set their SBTs and to what degree differences in SBT-setting behavior explain observed differences in OTP is still unknown. Here we develop econometric models of SBTs based on historical distributions of actual block time to reveal the differences in SBT-setting behavior between major airlines in China and the U.S. We find that Chinese airlines focus on the left tail of the distributions while the U.S. airlines consider the left tail, middle, and inner right tail. They also have different ways of accounting for taxi-out time in setting SBTs, with the U.S. focusing on historical time distributions while in China taxi-out time is based on airport category. We then perform counterfactual analysis by using one nation’s model to predict the other nation’s SBTs and the resulting difference in OTP. Results indicate that the OTP of Chinese airlines would match those of the U.S. if they followed U.S. practices in setting SBTs, while U.S. airlines would have slightly worse OTP than Chinese carriers if they set SBTs according to Chinese methods. Our findings highlight the difference in SBT-setting behavior of major airlines in China and U.S. and its contribution to OTP. The model and methods presented here may also be applied to study and compare SBT setting and its impact on OTP in other parts of the world.",0965-8564,Not found

This study takes a step further and analyses leisure activity participation, emotional well-being, and their mutual relationship by developing a recursive modelling framework. Official data from the well-being module associated to the American Time Use Survey is used for the empirical analysis. Complex mutual effects are found across the choice dimensions considered and the emotions experienced. Average treatment effects and marginal effects are also computed to evaluate how feelings are related to travel for leisure activities. It is found that on average, the participation in in-home leisure activity increases the level of happiness, while happiness levels are in turn negatively and strongly associated with in-home leisure activities. It is found that - in relation to out-of-home activity participation - involvement in leisure activity at home positively contributes to higher level of happiness, while individuals that experience positive emotions are less likely to be involved with in home leisure activities.

The success of implementing shared parking necessitates understanding the factors which affect people’s intention to use shared parking. In this study, we used the Combined Technology Acceptance Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior (C-TAM-TPB) as a theoretical framework to investigate the intention to use shared parking from the perspective of parking space suppliers and parking space demanders (drivers). Hypothesis testing using the partial least-square (PLS) method of structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed using an empirical assessment of the shared parking schemes in Taipei City. Our results indicate that perceived control and self-efficacy pertaining to participation in shared parking were the most influential factors for parking space demanders, whereas the influence of significant others was the most influential factor for parking suppliers. We also found that the attitude of potential users toward shared parking can strongly affect their intention to participate, whether as a demander or a supplier.

This paper aims to verify the possibility of replacing the traditional method with the more cost-effective best-worst case 1 method, using a customer survey recently conducted in Santander, Spain. The results show that the satisfaction level obtained from these alternative methods are remarkably similar.

Building on more recent travel behaviour research which has a socio-psychological approach and the mobility biography literature, this paper focusses on an individual’s public transport travel behaviour, as impacted by travel and residential location experiences in their childhood. The empirical analysis uses a bespoke retrospective survey with respondents from the Greater Metropolitan area of Sydney in New South Wales, Australia where understanding better the motivations underpinning travel behaviour are particularly acute, given the car dependent nature of Australian cities. A path model illustrates how residential neighbourhood perceptions and travel attitudes impact on travel behaviour and how these are influenced by background, including childhood residential and travel experiences. The results show the dominance of current travel attitudes on current travel behaviour but childhood experience is also significant and appearing to work by impacting current residential neighbourhood perceptions and travel attitudes, suggesting travel behaviour not only affected by personal attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics, but also influenced by context (spatial, social, cultural, etc.). When travel behaviour is seen as a social construct influenced by long standing and entrenched experiences influencing current perceptions and attitudes, policy that identifies which mobility practices are likely to be flexible and open to change is more likely to be successful in changing behaviour.",0965-8564,Not found

Spatiotemporal vulnerability analysis of railway systems with heterogeneous train flows,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.055,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to analyze the spatiotemporal vulnerability of a railway system with heterogeneous train flows. The spatiotemporal vulnerability is assessed by the passengers’ delay associated with the dynamic state of the railway system under a disruption, whose structure consists of a physical layer and a service layer. The physical layer is used to characterize the railway system’s post-disruption state, including damaged components and their damage occurrence time and duration; while the service layer is used to capture time-related attributes of trains and passengers to estimate the passengers’ delay. Based on these two layers, the spatiotemporal vulnerability of the railway system can be investigated for different disruptions. This study applies the proposed framework to Chinese Railway System and analyzes its spatiotemporal vulnerability under two types of disruptions: the individual station failure and the spatially localized failure.

Modeling social influence using sequential stated adaptation experiments: A study of city trip itinerary choice,10.1016/j.tra.2019.10.007,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This paper introduces a model that captures the effect of social influence on decision makers’ choice behavior in the context of sequential stated adaptation experiments, in which a decision maker first chooses the alternative he/she personally likes best from an experimentally varied choice set and then, after being informed about the choice of a certain social network member, chooses again from the same choice set. Social influence represents the effect of the choices of one or more social network members in the same choice situation on the choice behavior of a decision maker. It is assumed to depend on a decision maker’s socio-demographics and personality traits, and the strength of the relationship with the social network member. The concept of choice consistency is introduced to reflect a respondent’s tendency to stick with his/her original choice in completing the sequential stated choice tasks. By accounting for this effect, a less biased estimate of social influence is obtained. Similarly, the model accounts for the case that the first choice of the respondent and the social network member’s choice are identical by introducing a correction factor to further reduce the bias in the estimated social influence. To access the validity of the model, the choice of city trip itinerary was chosen as an example. Decision makers’ personality traits and their relationship with the social network member were treated as latent variables. Therefore, first, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was carried out to investigate the reliability and validity of the constructed scales. Then a sequential estimation approach was employed to avoid confounding between decision makers’ preferences towards attributes and the effects of social influence and choice consistency. In the first stage, the taste parameters were estimated and then in the second stage the composition of social influence effect and choice consistency effect were estimated simultaneously. Results show that the model reproduced the observed data well. Social influence has a modest but significant effect on decision makers’ choice behavior; decision makers’ socio-demographics and personality traits, social network type as well as the relationship with social network members all have significant effects on social influence. The effect of choice consistency is also significant.",0965-8564,Not found

Using hedonic methods and a sample of almost 60,000 house transactions in Ohio, I find that nearby establishments are an amenity capitalized into home prices only when there also exists access to adequate pedestrian pathing, and that walkability measures derived from computer vision methods contain information not found in other commonly used measures of walkability.

Inequalities in access to bike-and-ride opportunities: Findings for the city of Malmö,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.062,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Intermodality or combining more than one transport mode during a single trip has been put forward to facilitate a modal shift from private car to more environmentally friendly modes such as public transport, cycling or walking. Bike-and-ride – that is, integrating cycling and public transport in one trip – is an attractive combination, as cycling as an active and clean mode is faster than walking and more affordable and flexible than other alternative modes of transport. Using cycling as a feeder mode to public transport could potentially allow people to reach more opportunities and improve their mobility, and ultimately, their well-being. Therefore, it is relevant to investigate the inequalities in access to bike-and-ride options across population groups. In this context, we suggest assessing the inequalities in bicycle access to the main transport hubs of a city by developing a composite indicator based on accessibility measures and the Theil index of inequality. This indicator captures the role of both private and public bikes – part of a Bike Sharing System (BSS) – in accessing the existing public transport system. The novelty of our approach lies in bringing the distributional justice perspective in the accessibility evaluation of transport and analysing the inequalities within and between any arbitrarily defined population groups. Moreover, in addition to travel time by bike, this accessibility measure incorporates a series of bike-related features, such as the typology of bike lanes (separated from or shared with roads), the presence of a BSS in the network, and bike facilities (e.g., parking racks) in transport hubs. The proposed methodology is applied to a real case study of the city of Malmö, Sweden, to prove its efficacy and usefulness. In particular, we examine how the level of bicycle access to the major public transport destination (including train stations and regional bus hubs) varies across the population. While considering the contextual properties of the city of Malmö, the inequalities are analysed in relation to spatial dimension and social background of the population, it is possible to extend the proposed analysis by including further features of the population, such as income or gender, and apply the same approach to different contexts.",0965-8564,Not found
Influences of the built environment on travel: A household-based perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2019.10.003,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"The linkage between travel and the built environment has received extensive research attention over the past decades. However, the existing studies normally evaluate the built environment effect on travel from an individual-based perspective, neglecting the influence of intra-household interactions. We argue that individuals’ travel behavior is derived from the allocation of household tasks and resources (e.g., household vehicles) and the travel behaviors of household members are interdependent. This suggests that the built environment may impact one member’s travel behavior indirectly through its influence on others members’ travel choices. Thus, examining the travel impact of the built environment needs to consider intra-household interactions. This paper proposes to analyze the land use-travel relationship from a household perspective. We simultaneously examine the effects of the built environments of residential and work locations on married couples’ travel behaviors, considering the interrelations between their travels and controlling for both partners’ travel attitudes. The empirical study in Beijing, China indicates that the built environment effect on travel is different between partners. Two work environment factors influence the partners’ driving behaviors in opposite directions. Moreover, the wife’s travel behavior mediates the association between the built environment and the husband’s travel behavior. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the land use impact on travel behavior from the household perspective.",0965-8564,Not found
Effects of bundling policy on project cost under market uncertainty: A comparison across different highway project types,10.1016/j.tra.2019.10.001,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"As highway agencies seek project delivery strategies that can help minimize their overall costs, interest in the practice of project bundling, which refers to the combining of multiple projects of similar or different work types into a single contract, continues to increase. The past literature contains studies about the effects of bundling, particularly from a conceptual perspective, but with only minimal quantitative analysis of empirical data from past bundling projects. Past researchers hypothesized that the magnitude and direction of the effects of bundling policies on project cost differ not only across different market conditions but also across different highway project types. In seeking to test this hypothesis, this paper presents analysis that utilized past project cost data to verify the effects of these project-related and bundling-related factors on bundling outcomes. In the analysis that quantified the extent to which increasing the bundle size causes a reduction in the bidding competition, it was determined that this outcome varies across the different project types. In addition, using Monte Carlo simulation, the study established the bundle size threshold (the bundle size beyond which the project cost increases) and quantified the uncertainties associated with cost estimates that arise from varying bidding competition conditions; these were also found to vary across the different project types. The models introduced in this paper can be used by highway agencies at the early (planning) stages of development of a given project type, to predict the expected project award cost for different bundling alternatives and under different market uncertainties. Heightened awareness of the cost consequences across the different bundling policies, bidding market conditions, and project types can provide guidance to agencies that seek to establish or update project bundling policies.",0965-8564,Not found
"How large are the non-travel time effects of urban highway tunneling? Evidence from Maastricht, the Netherlands",10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.011,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Infrastructure projects increasing aim at to improve the quality of life and public space, in particular in urban areas. We analyse a Dutch case in which an existing highway in an urban area was moved underground in order to improve intercity traffic flows and to reduce the negative effects associated with an open urban highway. Travel times within the city hardly changed, which allows for a relatively clean identification of the other benefits via a hedonic pricing model. We find that the non-travel time benefits of such integrated infrastructure are substantial relative to the construction costs. A halving of distance to the tunneled segment is associated with a 3.4% appreciation in house prices since the start of the project. Taken together, the non-travel time effects add up to a quarter the construction costs.",0965-8564,Not found
On evasion behaviour in public transport: Dissatisfaction or contagion?,10.1016/j.tra.2019.10.005,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Fare evasion, in public transport (PT), is a major problem in certain countries and threatens the PT administrators’ funds directly. Hence, identifying the possible causes for this behaviour can be highly relevant. Governments and PT administrators aim to deliver first-class services to satisfy customers, who will then tend to reuse the services and recommend them to friends and family, attracting new users. Customer surveys help PT administrators determining which items are more relevant for users. We hypothesise that a direct link exists between overall and attribute-specific satisfaction and fare evading behaviour; we also test the notion that the evading behaviour of other users may directly impact the satisfaction of a given user. As such, we propose a general PT satisfaction-evasion behavioural model which considers (dis)satisfaction with other users’ fare evading behaviour, attribute-specific satisfaction, overall satisfaction, reuse intention, and self-reported fare evading behaviour. We base our analysis on a single intercept survey (n = 2,002), designed on the basis of focus groups conducted on users of two PT modes, Metro and bus, in Santiago de Chile. Using structural equation models (SEM) we are able to capture heterogeneous perceptions and behaviours among PT users. In particular, we found that evading behaviour increases when satisfaction with (i.e. attitude towards) other users’ fare evading behaviour increases (contagion effect), and when satisfaction with reliability decreases. We develop a behavioural fare evader profile, that could be useful in policy making. For overall satisfaction, we test a variety of models confirming that reliability is the most crucial satisfaction construct in our case. We provide policy recommendations for deterring fare evasion in Santiago based on our results, but our framework is clearly generalisable to other PT settings.",0965-8564,Not found
In search of the “Right Price” for air travel: First steps towards estimating granular price-demand elasticity,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.013,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Identifying price-demand elasticity for air travel using empirical data is fraught with issues. The largest of which is the problem of endogeneity. In this paper, we introduce instrumental variables derived from flow traffic passenger numbers to overcome endogeneity. When analyzing the price-demand relationship using flight date-point of sale and booking date-days to departure level data, flow traffic has the ideal property of influencing ticket prices via an airline’s inventory control function yet is uncorrelated with demand shocks in the origin and destination market of interest. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression models report that the demand of the given market is highly inelastic at −0.148. Implementing the 2-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) model with our proposed instruments, we find that demand is in fact elastic at −1.157 which is consistent with industry observations. The proposed model is the first to estimate price elasticity using granular level data combining revenue accounting coupons, booking and ticketing data. The elasticity estimates account for endogeneity and granular characteristics such as days to departure, booking and travel day of the week, point of sale, holidays and special events.",0965-8564,Not found
China railway industry reform evolution approach: Based on the Vertical Separation Model,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.049,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"In this paper a mathematical statistics and measurement approach called trans-logarithmic total cost function is used to give an objective calculation result to support Vertical Separation (VS) based reform of China railway industry. Three questions including whether the VS is suitable for the railway reform evolution in China, whether the VS can reduce the operation cost in China and the specific VS-based reform process are discussed and solved. Three total costs related parameters, two elasticity of marginal cost values, and three total income related parameters are applied to the decision-making. The results of case study show that: The passenger-freight transport combination is not helpful to reduce the total operation cost; Freight cost and network total cost, passenger cost and network total cost are replaceable; Passenger transport volume increases per 1%, the freight transport cost increases 2.154%, freight transport volume increases per 1%, the passenger transport cost increases 2.741%; It is inefficient when applied passenger-freight transport combination model; It is better to separate the passenger transport service, freight transport service and the railway network vertically. Finally, the detail China railway industry reform recommendations are presented with three steps: first, Railway Passenger Transport Corporation, Freight-Network Combination Corporation, Railway Freight Transport Corporation, Branch Railway Corporation and Public Interest Railway Corporation can be established and managed by China Railway Corporation, some powerful and related supporting policies should be formulated and carried out by State Railway Administration to ensure the reform enforcement; second, the investment approaches, railway industry incentives system etc. are the key reform elements; third, the passenger transport service, freight transport service and network service companies can be separated totally.",0965-8564,Not found

Exploring the equity performance of bike-sharing systems with disaggregated data: A story of southern Tampa,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.048,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"The rising adoption of bike-sharing systems brings significant benefits to individuals and society as a whole. However, whether these benefits are distributed throughout society in a fair manner is still an open question. This study presents a methodological framework for assessing the equity performance of bike-sharing systems, with Coast Bike Share system in southern Tampa as a case study. The framework integrates three different datasets: bike-sharing infrastructure, individual travel itineraries and individual sociodemographic attribute data. With these datasets, we model individual accessibility to activity locations using bike-sharing as the mode of transportation by analyzing the “walking-cycling-walking” process of a bike-sharing trip and the trip-chaining behavior in individuals’ travel itineraries. Further, a series of equity measures are used to analyze equity performance from the perspective of both horizontal and vertical equity. To assess horizontal equity, we apply the Lorenz curve, Gini index and mapped geographic differences. For vertical equity, we compare descriptive statistics by group, perform analysis of variance, and calculate the subgroup inequality index using disaggregated data. Results reveal that accessibility to bike-sharing is not evenly distributed among individuals in the population, within the geographic space, and among different sociodemographic groups of southern Tampa. Further, our results also highlight the need to incorporate high-resolution disaggregated data and tour-based analysis to address the equity performance of bike-sharing systems.",0965-8564,Not found
"The role of practical, cognitive and symbolic factors in the successful implementation of battery electric vehicles in Norway",10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.045,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Reducing emissions from privately-owned cars plays a central role in reaching targets for global greenhouse gas emissions. Electrification has been one strategy to meet this goal. Norway has been a forerunner and is today the country with the highest proportion of privately-owned battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in Europe. Thus, studying Norwegian experiences with electric mobility should be useful for those working with the electrification of person transport in other countries. In this paper, we analyze user experiences with different models of BEVs, symbolic dimensions of BEV ownership and use, and the significance of incentives promoting BEVs. We argue that the total package of incentives not only provides instrumental motives to buy BEVs but represents a highly visible, national policy in support of BEVs that has been important for adoption, giving BEVs a symbolic certification as an environmentally sound mobility choice. The paper also points to the way incentives for BEVs have different meaning to different drivers according to BEV model and driving experience. Hence, we stress the importance of not treating BEVs as a homogenous technology when developing policy. We argue that the combination of the economic and symbolic value of incentives, technical and practical dimensions of BEVs and not least growing environmental concerns have fostered the successful introduction of BEVs in Norway. The paper is based on in-depth interviews with different segments of BEV drivers in 2013 and 2015, as well as data from two surveys conducted by the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association in 2016 and 2017.",0965-8564,Not found
Uber and urban crime,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.044,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This paper investigates the association of Uber, a substantial transportation innovation, with crime counts in urban areas that have accepted the program. I find the introduction of Uber to be associated with a large and significant reduction of personal crimes by 5% in treated cities (about 43 personal crimes a month, roughly 41 assaults), and discuss several mechanisms through which Uber may be enacting this change. The detailed data set allows us to identify that this crime reduction is equally significant on the weekends, when Uber is expected to deliver the most rides to and from bars. Furthermore, the significant personal crime reduction is almost entirely composed of assaults, which are known to typically be alcohol-related, while no significant reduction occurs in the plausibly irrelevant crimes against property, society, or other personal crimes. These estimates suggests that such ride-sharing programs may have positive effects toward crime reduction that otherwise may not inherently be taken into account by policy makers.",0965-8564,Not found
Estimating and predicting the operational costs of road tolls: An econometric assessment using panel data,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.047,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"We develop an econometric procedure to estimate the operational costs of toll road projects. To show its usefulness for planning future tolls, we test its predictive power on out-of-the sample observations. Thus, the rationale for the paper is that previous studies have utilized less succinct econometric frameworks to derive factors that significantly explain the operational costs of toll roads and have provided little evidence regarding the predictive power of the models used. Panel data on 33 Norwegian toll road projects observed during the period 2011–2015 are used for the purpose, resulting in a total of 165 observations. The results reveal the following: (i) Toll operations are heterogeneous, so that individual characteristics matter; ceteris paribus, this should be accounted for when estimating operational costs. (ii) The average operational cost per vehicle (AVC) processed at tolls is approximately 4 NOK (≈ US$ 0.44). (iii) The volume of vehicle throughput reduces operational costs, demonstrating the existence of scale economies; the number of lanes served increases operational costs; the use of an Open Road Toll (ORT) charging system reduces operational costs; the tendering of toll collections reduces operational costs; and the share of vehicles that use On Board Units (OBU) reduces operational costs. It is shown that the econometric model developed here has high predictive power and can be used to predict the operational costs of future tolls. These results reaffirm the results of some earlier studies but serve to warn that one should not be indifferent to the framework of analysis used, as the results may not be statistically significant and robust. The econometric framework developed here is an advance due to its predictive power.",0965-8564,Not found
Parking prices and the decision to drive to work: Evidence from California,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.064,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This paper explores the impact of parking prices on the decision to drive to work using a California household travel survey dataset and a discrete choice model. The paper tackles estimation challenges posed by insufficient parking information. The first challenge is the estimation of parking prices for those who do not drive, which is addressed by using a sample selection model. The second challenge is to understand the effect of the extent of the prevalence of Employer-Paid parking coupled with incentive programs offered in-lieu of parking. To address this challenge, two extreme scenarios are examined, and a range for the marginal effects of parking prices is estimated; one scenario assumes everyone receives Employer-Paid parking coupled with in-lieu of parking incentives, and the second assumes that no one is offered such incentives. The results suggest that higher parking prices reduce driving, regardless of the followed approach. It is estimated that a 10% increase in parking prices leads to a 1–2 percentage point decline in the probability of driving to work. This range varies with initial parking prices, where the lower end of the range increases at a decreasing rate, and the higher end peaks at $2.5 and decreases with higher prices. Moreover, there seems to be no evidence of sample selection bias. The evidence confirms that parking pricing can indeed be an effective transportation demand management tool.",0965-8564,Not found
An analysis of the individual economics of ride-hailing drivers,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.056,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Ride-hailing companies are disrupting transportation at a large scale while also providing economic opportunities to millions of drivers. Companies such as Uber and Lyft constantly promote potential earnings on the order of $25–$35 per hour. Yet, the advertised earnings do not account for factors such as time spent without passengers, the need to travel back-and-forth between areas of low and high ridership, driver residential location, or driving expenses. By examining a unique and detailed dataset collected using ethnographic methods – primary data collected by one of the authors who became an independent contractor to drive for both Uber and Lyft in the Denver area – we examine actual earnings with three common expense scenarios to answer the question of how much ride-hailing drivers actually earn. This study first assesses the cost per mile to passengers – including fare, fees, tolls, and gratuity – and finds that the result follows a power law function (in relation to trip distance) with a median cost of $2.50 per mile (not including value of time). We then assess driver earnings and estimate gross wages averaging $15.57 per hour. Given three common expense scenarios, we estimate net hourly wages ranging between $5.72 and $10.46 per hour before taxes. This suggests that most ride-hailing drivers earn less than the state minimum wage in Colorado. Our results also suggest that drivers are better off parking and waiting for the next ride request rather than driving to a more active location unless doing so cuts at least 30% of ride request waiting time. We then identify cruising and deadheading as negative externalities of ride-hailing and suggest per-mile ride-hailing fees, which start at zero passengers and provide discounts, based on increasing vehicle occupancy, to help mitigate this issue. While our data collection focused on the Denver region, ride-hailing rates and cost of living adjustments to specific cities can be used for comparison, providing insight into the individual economics for ride-hailing drivers.",0965-8564,Not found

Although in-vehicle crowding has usually been studied as a tangible attribute, previous research has shown that the standing passenger density cannot fully explain the experience of crowding. In the present work, we used the hybrid discrete choice modeling approach in order to provide a richer explanation of in-vehicle crowding in a choice context between Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Metro, using Bogotá as a case of study. Modeling results showed that perceived discomfort, perceived insecurity, waiting time, fare, travel time, and its interaction with the positive attitude towards crowding, are the main variables in explaining the choice process. We found that the positive attitude towards crowding affects the perception of the standing passengers’ density level. We demonstrated that this attitude depends on non-transportation information since people who live in larger spaces, as well as people who live in apartments, have a greater positive attitude towards crowding. We obtained crowding multipliers in regarding the users’ attitude for different levels of overcrowding and analyze several policies related to latent variables.",0965-8564,Not found
Effects of dockless bike-sharing systems on the usage of the London Cycle Hire,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.050,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This paper evaluates the effects of dockless bike-sharing systems on the usage of the London Cycle Hire (LCH). A total number of 707 LCH docking stations are included for a period of 36 weeks. Covariates such as socio-demographic characteristics, traffic conditions, and the built environment are included in the data set. A difference in difference (DID) based propensity score matching (PSM) method is applied to select control docking stations and estimate the effects of the dockless bike-sharing systems on the LCH usage. The results suggest that a significant reduction of 22.42 (5.93%) in the average weekly usage of each LCH docking station is caused by the dockless bike-sharing system after its initial launch. We also investigate the effects of dockless bike-sharing systems on the characteristics of the LCH trips, including travel duration, travel distance, and departure time. The majority of trips replaced by the dockless bikes are short duration (0–15 min) and middle distance (1–3 km) trips. The reduction in the average weekly short duration trips of each station is 16.91 (7.16%), while the figure is 15.11 (6.74%) for middle distance trips. The average travel duration is increased by 0.25 min, but the travel distance shows no significant change due to data restriction. Furthermore, the LCH usage is significantly reduced by 6.85% during the weekday commuting peak, and 10.47% during the weekend leisure peak. As to weekday off-peak and other times, reductions are not statistically significant.",0965-8564,Not found
Modelling departure time choice using mobile phone data,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.054,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"The rapid growth in passive mobility tracking technologies has led to departure time choice studies based on GPS data in recent years (e.g. Peer et al., 2013). GPS data however typically has limited sample sizes and is affected by technical issues like signal losses and battery depletion leading to gaps in the data. On the other hand, the rapid growth in mobile phone penetration rates has led to the emergence of alternative passive mobility datasets such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) data. GSM data covers much wider proportions of the population and can be used to infer departure time information. This motivates this research where we investigate the potential use of GSM data for modelling departure time choice. We describe practical approaches to extract relevant information from GSM data and propose a modelling framework that accounts for the fact that the desired departure times are unobserved. We assume that the preferred departure times vary randomly across the users and apply the mixed logit framework to jointly estimate the distribution parameters of the preferred departure times and the sensitivities to schedule delay. Comparison of the model results and time valuation metrics derived from the GSM data with similar metrics derived from the GPS data of a subset of the users reveals that the fewer time gaps in the GSM data lead to reliable model outputs. The proposed framework can be used for mobile phone and other passive data sources with unobserved preferred departure times.",0965-8564,Not found

Findings showed that: (1) the NAM theory was associated with multimodal and monomodal green mode use in summertime, while this relation was not supported for wintertime, (2) most of the students in the current sample were green transport-oriented, and (3) situational factors such as accessibility to public transit and cycling time to university were more important for modality use during wintertime than summertime. Policymakers could implement measures so as to provide availability of all green transport modes and routes, such as reliable and safe bicycle and walking paths, for all days during wintertime even during days with heavy snowfall in order to activate individuals’ moral obligations towards reducing car use and modal shifts from car to green transport modes. Furthermore, encouraging students to be multimodal green transport users could be a feasible policy in order to reduce the probability of any shift from a green-oriented mode to the car, even in days with exceptional weather during the winter season.",0965-8564,Not found
Information adoption in commuters’ route choice in the context of social interactions,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.041,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"The rapid development of information technology has significantly promoted social interactions among people. Social interactions may have become an important channel for commuters to obtain traffic information. Although commuters’ own travel experience and Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS) are acknowledged as two common traffic information sources that can impact commuters’ route choice, the possible influence of social interactions has not yet been empirically confirmed. Therefore, an empirical study is conducted in this paper to explore whether and how social interactions affect commuters’ route choice. The presented study is divided into two phases. First, 1000 commuters are surveyed about their social interactions with other commuters. A total of 809 valid questionnaires are returned from the commuters. The survey confirms that social interactions among the commuters are very common and indeed influence commuters’ route choice. Second, because the essence of the influence of social interactions on commuters’ route choice is an information-adoption process, partial least squares (PLS) component-based structural equation modelling (SEM) is employed to study the key success factors that influence information adoption in commuters’ route choice in the context of social interactions. In the second phase, 236 valid questionnaires were returned. The obtained results demonstrate that information relevance, information accuracy, source expertise, source integrity, usefulness and extraversion are the factors that have significant influence on commuters’ information adoption in the context of social interactions; while the roles of responding, trust and field dependence are not significant. Finally, some discussion and inspirations are provided based on the data analysis results.

Since road transportation is the main mean of transportation in emerging countries, the aim of this paper is to present the analysis carried out to measure the travel time reliability thanks to different methodologies based on freight data collection using GPS (Global Positioning System), as a key element to assess freight fluidity in freight transportation corridors. The analysis measured items such as: (i) percentiles of travel time; (ii) planning time index; (iii) buffer time index; (iv) skew and range of travel. Different probability distributions were analysed and the distribution of travel time data was determined through statistical hypothesis test. The conclusion was that distributions with upper tails longer than usual fit better to the collected data. Evidences of mixture distributions in the travel time data were also found. Finally, the paper also presents useful conclusions to develop future research as well as to improve practices for decision makers.",0965-8564,Not found
Spatiotemporal evolution of ridesourcing markets under the new restriction policy: A case study in Shanghai,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.052,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Identifying and understanding factors that influence the demand of ridesourcing market is essential for online hailing systems to improve the quality of service. This paper proposes a two-level growth model (GM) to identify the potential multi-level factors that may affect online ride-hailing service demand. By using the massive datasets from Didi Chuxing, Inc., including both Didi Express and Didi Taxi services, the order number fluctuations at different urban circle zones after the implementation of restrictions on ridesourcing in Shanghai, 2016 were analyzed, to assess the competition and mutual complementarities between Express and Taxi, the two major services provided by Didi Chuxing. The relative market share of Express was estimated to reveal the possible related spatial and temporal factors, which further demonstrates significant positive associations between ridesourcing demand and built environment factors, such as commercial/residential land use, public transport accessibility, as well as weather conditions. Metro service availability and rainy weather were found correlated with a relatively higher market share of Express service. Additionally, compared to the regular road transit service, the metro system was found to have a stronger correlation with the ridesourcing demand. Findings of this study may provide guidelines for urban planning and traffic operations, which in turn assists to achieve high-quality ridesourcing service for travellers.",0965-8564,Not found
Access work: Experiences of parking at school for families living with childhood disability,10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.016,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"The proliferation of automobility has undeniably influenced school site designs and school transportation experiences. Using private vehicles, many parents now routinely enter and park on or near school sites to drop-off and pick-up their children. However, ableist designs and practices that discount much of the human condition’s bodily and physiological diversity can produce inequitable, work-intensive school parking experiences for families living with childhood disability. This article presents parking-related findings from an ethnographic study about how families living with childhood disability experience everyday school travel throughout the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area in Ontario, Canada. The findings indicate that the families sometimes encounter technically accessible, but functionally inaccessible school site parking options. Further, the families are frequently required and relied on by schools to perform various types of access work (i.e., physical, temporal, and social) to compensate for school site inaccessibility. To improve school site accessibility, and to make education access more equitable, we suggest deliberate engagement with the families’ unique experiences and viewpoints. We also suggest incorporating a critical ableist studies perspective into school site design processes, as it facilitates explicit recognition of ableist elements and the unsettling of normalized, exclusionary designs and practices.",0965-8564,Not found
Identifying latent mode-use propensity segments in an all-AV era,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.015,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This study offers an early glimpse of how individuals perceive the advantages/disadvantages of AVs, their mode-use intentions, and potential market segments with respect to mode use, should AVs eventually become the only way to travel by car. To do so, we implemented a statewide survey of Georgia residents (N = 2890) and using that data, we applied factor analyses to two blocks of AV-related statements. The first block measured 12 perceptions of AVs, and yielded two psychological constructs: AV pros (advantages/ benefits) and AV overuse cons (negative outcomes specifically associated with the excessive use of AVs). The second block of statements measured respondents’ inclinations between AV and non-AV options for 12 hypothetical transportation “needs”, and factor analysis identified four mode-use propensity constructs: AV(-inclined) over walk/bike, AV over flight, zero-occupant AV over occupied AV, and AV over transit. The main goal of the paper was to segment the sample on the basis of these four mode-use propensities, to identify clusters with similar propensity profiles or response vectors. We applied latent class cluster analysis to do so, and identified seven potential market segments: some preferring AV options in general, others preferring non-AV options or having unique propensity patterns based on certain contexts (e.g. long distance travel and vehicle occupancy). In the model, socio-demographics, geography, attitudes, and perceptions of AVs help characterize those market segments, and this provides a basis for deeper interpretation and consideration of policy implications.",0965-8564,Not found
The death and rebirth of bikesharing in Seattle: Implications for policy and system design,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.012,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"What factors determine the ridership of micro-mobility systems such as bikesharing or scooter sharing? This paper presents a case study on bikesharing in Seattle, USA, which has the distinction of being both one of the few cities in the world where a modern public bikesharing system (named Pronto in Seattle) has been shut down, and the first US city to permit dockless bikesharing operations. These dockless services produced more bikesharing trips in four months than Pronto did in its entire two-and-a-half-year run, and in their first year 11 times more rides than Pronto had in its first year. The contrast in performance between these two systems provides a unique opportunity to test alternative theories for why Pronto’s ridership struggled where others have succeeded, offering more general insights into how system designers and regulators can avoid repeating the pitfalls of Seattle’s original bikesharing launch. This case study triangulates qualitatively between popular press reports, interviews with key stakeholders, an original survey of bikesharing users, and ridership data from multiple bikesharing systems to evaluate the contributions of eleven factors to Pronto’s low ridership. It concludes that the most important reasons for Pronto’s struggles were inadequate system scale, station density, geographic coverage area, ease of use, and pricing structure. Critically, these factors all represent explicit choices made by system designers and policymakers, rather than local market or environmental factors beyond their control. The higher ridership of dockless bikesharing in Seattle appears primarily due to differences in these factors, which are not necessarily exclusive to dockless services. The paper closes with a discussion of how policymakers can avoid condemning emerging micro-mobility services to Pronto’s fate of low ridership.",0965-8564,Not found

The analysis focuses on the interactions between public transport systems and MaaS developments in Amsterdam, Birmingham, and Helsinki. Case comparison is informed by the multilevel perspective on socio-technical transitions and literature on meta-governance of networks. Drawing on these frameworks and empirical findings, the paper identifies six governance approaches to MaaS across cases: analyser, architect, convener, experimenter, lawmaker, and provider. These basic models encompass strategies ranging from hands-on strong intervention to information collection efforts. Consistent with the transitions literature, these six approaches indicate that public transport regimes seek to control the apparent disruptive potential of MaaS by incrementally absorbing innovations; to this end, regime actors adopt governance responses that tend to reproduce existing institutionalised ways of doing and prevailing logics. Furthermore, the six approaches reveal intense interaction between regime and niche, suggesting that a niche-regime space might have emerged in the cases; actors travel and operate across niche, regime, and niche-regimes, mainly driven by concerns with market share and revenue streams in the mobility system.",0965-8564,Not found

The influential factors studied are safety climate, stress, and inattention. This theoretical framework then was used to explore how it could help to prevent fatal accidents through reduction of aberrant driving behavior by occupational bus drivers. Measures adopted from a driver behavior questionnaire, driver behavior inventory, attention-related driving error scale, and safety climate questionnaire were used after screening. Data were collected from 1140 respondents in 30 bus companies in Taiwan. A ten-step procedure is developed for testing nine hypotheses. Results supported all the hypotheses within the proposed cross-sectional modeling framework showing that the direct effect of safety climate, stress and inattention on aberrant driving behavior in a bus company is critical. Further, mediation by safety-focused cognitive and emotional engagement by drivers to improve safety performance cannot be overlooked. A 2018 revision to Taiwan’s Labor Standards Act concerns the reduction of bus drivers’ aberrant driving behavior; the expected benefit thus produced in terms of traffic safety is discussed. To realize the potential benefit and also eliminate negative effects of the amendment upon the national economy and mitigate inconvenience thus incurred to people’s daily life, a follow-up study is required.",0965-8564,Not found

Causal effects between bus revenue vehicle-kilometers and bus ridership,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.019,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"To create a sustainable urban transportation environment, transportation authorities often implement incentive strategies to attract new public transportation users. Various studies have shown that increasing bus revenue vehicle-kilometers (BK) is a key factor for increasing bus ridership (BR). In this situation, BK affects BR. However, an increase in BR may lead to an increase in BK. Then, BR affects BK. The existence and directions of causal effects between BK and BR are the research questions addressed in this study. Since 2007, the Taichung City Government has been adding and adjusting bus routes to build a dense bus network. In 2011, it implemented a free fare bus policy. BR grew from ca. 2 million per month in 2007 to 10 million per month in 2015. Moreover, BK increased by ca. 3 times during that same period. This provides an opportunity to understand the causal effects between BK and BR. Extended convergent cross mapping (ECCM) can be used to assess the causal relationship between two variables without modelling. We adopted this method to distinguish the influences of BK and BR. According to the results, increasing BK attracted more public transit passengers during the period 2007 to 2010. However, there was no effect of BR on BK. After implementation of free fare bus policy in 2011, increases in BK led to increases in BR and increases in BR drove incremental growth of BK. The result was a virtuous cycle of mutual influence between BK and BR. In conclusion, increasing BK, such as route length or number of scheduled runs, can promote the usage of public transportation. Moreover, authorities can implement free fare bus policy to attract potential users and force incremental growth of BK.",0965-8564,Not found
"Laboratory experimentation and simulation of discrete direction choices: Investigating hypothetical bias, decision-rule effect and external validity based on aggregate prediction measures",10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.040,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Introduction Laboratory experiments have recently become popular methods for understanding decision-making behaviour of humans in evacuations. When designed for individual-level data extraction, these experiments can be analysed by econometric models. These models can subsequently be implemented as part of broader computational tools that simulate evacuation processes. In taking this approach, a modeller will face several major questions at both experiment design and estimation/implementation phases: (I) Can the behaviour be instead inferred, with adequate accuracy, from stated choice surveys (i.e. hypothetical bias)? (II) Given that these laboratory experiments are performed in specific geometric layouts, are their modelling outcomes transferable to geometric layouts other than that of their origin (i.e. external validity)? (III) At the modelling phase, how critical is to determine whether to set the decision rule as random regret minimisation as opposed to random utility maximisation (i.e. decision rule)? This study investigates how each of these three problems impact on prediction outcomes when these models are employed to simulate an evacuation system. Methods Using three sets of experimental observations of discrete direction choice (one stated-choice dataset and two revealed-choice datasets) and by integrating their associated choice models with the crowd motion simulation tool that we have developed, we examined these questions mainly based on aggregate simulation outputs, including evacuation times, exit utilisations and movement patterns. Findings Our findings showed that the effect of decision rule specification on the prediction of aggregate measures was less noticeable and of little practical importance compared to the effect of hypothetical bias. Counterpart regret and utility models resulted in very similar simulated movement patterns, evacuation times and exit utilisations. Changing the source of the model estimation, however, made relatively bigger differences in those predictions, although not to drastic levels. In general, however, models obtained from independent experiments showed great degrees of parameter similarity and prediction consistency, while the most noticable difference between them was related to their scales. Despite the scale difference, models estimated from one experiment well replicated independent observations of the other experiment. In other words, models dervied from all three data sources proved almost equally valid for accurately replicating macro-scale observations. Applications These questions are of practical importance in the design and analysis of laboratory evacuation experiments and in establishing their external validity/transferability and also in prioritising modelling issues. Future directions The question of decision rule could be revisited using more recent versions of the random regret model (than the 2010 variant, applied here). The question can also potentially be extended to comparisons between the econometric and machine-learning methods. The question of experimental validity needs further investigation in relation to the aspects of evacuation decision-making other than the direction choice.",0965-8564,Not found
Stochastic simulated rents in Portuguese public-private partnerships,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.005,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This paper aims to study the contracts of the Portuguese Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) of the motorway sector which represent an important part of the Annual Portuguese State Budget, as well as a crucial contribution to the Portuguese Public Debt. Once the formulae determining annual rents due to the private partners depend on stochastic variables, their simulation is binding. Otherwise, the Public Finances can suffer large losses. Our study is essential aiming to defend the Public interest and the political transparency as well as to present tools to prevent future excessive costs. In order to perform a simulation of the PP rents we started by describing the related contracts and analysing the mathematical formulae therein, following an insightful look and a descriptive analysis the historical data. Finally, a stochastic simulation study of the injury accident rates allowed us to calculate their rates as well as their renting implications. The simulated values are in accordance with our previous analysis, showing the existence of negative values for bonuses and penalties in the contracts. We discover the existence of an important trend: the bonuses increase and the penalties decrease when regarding symmetric variations in the fatal accident rates. This results in a strong and negative impact in the Portuguese Public Treasure. For the first time numerical flaws present in PPP contracts were systematically analysed by using a new statistical tool. This approach fills a gap when we are dealing with these issues allowing the partners to decide in a well informed manner.",0965-8564,Not found
What value do travelers put on connectivity to mobile phone and Internet networks in public transport? Empirical evidence from the Paris region,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.006,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Unlike the drivers of private vehicles, public transport (PT) users may perform secondary tasks during their primary travel activity. Moreover, Information and Communication Technologies may open up “multi-tasking” possibilities by allowing individuals to spend their travel time in more pleasant ways. This article proposes a tentative valuation of connectivity to mobile phone and Internet networks (MPIN) in PT, based on the stated preferences of 501 inhabitants of the Paris region. The surveyed individuals were presented with hypothetical trade-offs between travel time reductions and improvements in MPIN connectivity in PT. Econometric tests show that the values ascribed to better connectivity are higher when PT users perform various tasks with smartphones or tablets during their trips and when they experience a large number of connectivity problems in the reference situation. While heterogeneity between individuals has a minor direct impact, we propose a typology of PT users that captures variations in valuations. On average, the subjective value of travel time would be reduced by 12% if PT users benefited from optimal MPIN connectivity whilst traveling. Alternative “time multipliers” – for types of PT user, gradual connectivity improvements, different device-based tasks – are also proposed. Lastly, we apply our results to a cost-benefit analysis of a current project in the Paris region PT.",0965-8564,Not found

Length of disability (less than 6 months, more than 6 months, or lifetime) is associated with the type of mobility aid used to support travel, some aspects of day-to-day travel, and the odds of taking a trip for errands, shopping, social, or recreational reasons. Those with a lifetime disability had lower odds of traveling for errands or shopping (OR = 0.68, p < 0.05) compared to those with a temporary or more recent onset of disability, all else constant.

Understanding the fragmented demand for transportation – Small traditional retailers in emerging markets,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.003,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"The demand for goods transportation in emerging markets is fragmented, mainly due to the unstructured and informal ordering behavior of the many small, traditional retailers in these markets. In this paper, we study such small traditional retailers located in the neighborhoods of big cities in emerging markets. We call them nanostores. Although modern retailing has grown in the last two decades in these markets, the number of nanostores is still increasing and serving a substantial part of the daily demand for many basic products, such as bread, milk, and cooking oil. We thus conduct an empirical study to understand the business environment of these nanostores in emerging markets by collecting data from 333 nanostores, spread over eight large cities in Morocco. We analyze the data, conduct a cluster analysis, and describe their business environment with a focus on their order behavior, which typically triggers the transportation decisions upstream in the supply chain. We find that the order information from these retailers may not be the best information to rely on when making transportation decisions. Our study also provides several interesting insights that may help organize transportation toward these nanostores in a fundamentally different way. We also discuss a number of opportunities to improve the efficiency of the supply chains that serve them.",0965-8564,Not found

Designing optimal jet fuel hedging strategies for airlines – Why hedging will not always reduce risk exposure,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.014,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Using a historical simulation based Value at Risk (VaR) model, we provide the first empirical study quantifying the benefits and the costs associated with the fuel hedging activities of airlines. More specifically, we quantify the jet fuel risk exposure and estimate the cash collateral required to support jet fuel hedging using exchange traded futures. The results from our VaR model suggest that although hedging significantly reduces risk exposure, the associated collateral costs are large enough to offset, to a large extent, the potential financial benefits of the hedge to airlines. Increasing the hedging ratio beyond 60–70% results in a marginal reduction in the market risk exposure but significantly increases the cash collateral requirements. Our results demonstrate that the amount of cash collateral is a key factor in hedging decisions of airlines and, while this somewhat contradicts extant literature, is consistent with recent management practice.",0965-8564,Not found

Applying affective event theory to explain transit users’ reactions to service disruptions,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.059,130,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Transit systems are complex open systems susceptible to service disruptions due to a variety of operational and infrastructure failures. Demand-side transit user reactions form an important part of system resilience. This study proposes Affective Events Theory (AET) to understand transit users’ frustration and behavioral reaction to service disruptions. The behavioral reactions are structured in accordance with Hirschman’s Exit-Voice-Loyalty framework. While service disruptions can cause passenger frustration, the behavioral response varies from complaints (voiced) to avoiding transit use on the next trip (exit), and continue as usual (loyalty). The collected data is a representative sample of 1629 transit users from Innsbruck (Austria). Exploratory factor analysis followed by an estimation of a structural equation model served to validate the model framework. Better network coverage, service quality, and personnel behavior mitigate the frustration of transit users upon event occurence. Higher transit user frustration is related to a higher frequency of service disruptions. Higher frustration is related to more complaints (voiced). However, the tendency to complain is associated with lower, reduced transit use on the next trip (exit), meaning that voice and exit substitute each other.",0965-8564,Not found

Reprint of: The importance of user perspective in the evolution of MaaS,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.024,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The rapid emergence of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) into the transport sector’s lexicon has brought with it an air of expectation that suggests a future mobility revolution. This paper focusses on the user perspective and offers a deepening of socio-technical thinking about MaaS and its prospects. It first provides an examination of what is understood to date about MaaS in what is a new but rapidly evolving body of literature. This highlights the concept of MaaS as a ‘mobility system beyond the private car’ and the new centrality of a ‘mobility intermediary’ layer in that system. The paper then focuses and elaborates upon its contention that MaaS is neither new nor revolutionary but is rather an evolutionary continuation in terms of transport integration. Emerging from an era of unimodal travel information systems becoming multimodal and then integrated multimodal information services, MaaS is now about adding seamless booking, payment and ticketing to the integration offer. The paper puts forward a ‘Levels of MaaS Integration (LMI) taxonomy’ analogous to the level 0–5 SAE taxonomy for automation of road vehicles. This taxonomy, designed around the user perspective (including cognitive user effort), concerns operational, information and transactional integration that it is suggested reflect a hierarchy of user need. From a synthesis of insights from the ‘pre-MaaS’ literature concerning choice making for travel and the role of information, a MaaS behavioural schema is provided to illustrate potential consideration and adoption of MaaS from the user perspective.

Demand responsive transport: Generation of activity patterns from mobile phone network data to support the operation of new mobility services,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.038,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Demand Responsive Transport (DRT), covering the first/last mile of a journey, plays a pivotal role in the delivery of a seamless integrated door-to-door service, which is a fundamental requirement for the implementation of Mobility as a Service (MaaS). Business models currently in use do not deliver sustainable and durable DRT in urban areas. This can be minimised using transport modelling tools ahead of the operation phase. However, transport models are not fit for purpose when it comes to model on-demand shared mobility services and the integration of these services in a complex public transport ecosystem. This paper focuses on how to model demand for ride-shared mobility services and how to plan for these services when running in integration with mass transit. An Agent Based Model (ABM), built in the open-source Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MatSim) platform for Bristol (UK), has used an activity-based approach to model demand for two New Mobility Services (NMS). This was then generated using anonymised and aggregated Mobile phone Network Dataset (MND), both as a trip-based and trip chains dataset to assess the capabilities of MND. Results show that the simulations built using the trip chains MND datasets (722,752 agents generated) lead to better insights in users’ travel patterns. An advanced method using additional data sources covering land-use (location of business, services and transport facilities) was used to infer purpose and mode of transport during the multimodal journeys. The output of the ABM predicts demand for two flexible on-demand services, identifying best routes to maximise the number of users served and quantifying the benefits in the integration with public transport services and in modal shift from private cars. This is expected to be useful either for Local Authorities for transport planning purposes, and for operators looking at financially sustainable DRT.",0965-8564,Not found
Questioning mobility as a service: Unanticipated implications for society and governance,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.033,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"In this paper we focus on the development of a new service model for accessing transport, namely Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and present one of the first critical analyses of the rhetoric surrounding the concept. One central assumption of one prevalent MaaS conceptualization is that transport services are bundled into service packages for monthly payment, as in the telecommunication or media service sectors. Various other forms of MaaS are being developed but all tend to offer door-to-door multi-modal mobility services, brokered via digital platforms connecting users and service operators. By drawing on literature concerned with socio-technical transitions, we address two multi-layered questions. First, to what extent can the MaaS promises (to citizens and cities) be delivered, and what are the unanticipated societal implications that could arise from a wholesale adoption of MaaS in relation to key issues such as wellbeing, emissions and social inclusion? Second, what are de facto challenges for urban governance if the packaged services model of MaaS is widely adopted, and what are the recommended responses? To address these questions, we begin by considering the evolution of intelligent transport systems that underpin the current vision of MaaS and highlight how the new business model could provide a mechanism to make MaaS truly disruptive. We then identify a set of plausible unanticipated societal effects that have implications for urban planning and transport governance. This is followed by a critical assessment of the persuasive rhetoric around MaaS that makes grand promises about efficiency, choice and freedom. Our conclusion is that the range of possible unanticipated consequences carries risks that require public intervention (i.e. steering) for reasons of both efficiency and equity.",0965-8564,Not found

The analysis of the collected data contributed to the in-depth analysis of the MaaS business ecosystem and the identification of the champions of MaaS in the three areas. Prototype business models for MaaS are developed based on the Osterwalder’s canvas, to describe how MaaS operators may create, deliver, and capture value. Our findings indicate that the MaaS ecosystem comprises of public and private actors who need to cooperate and compete in order to capture value. Although noticeable deviations among the study areas are observed, mobility service providers, public transport authorities and regional authorities were commonly indicated as the key actors in a MaaS partnership. In addition, viewed as a system, enablers and barriers to MaaS are identified based on the systems’ of innovation approach. The analysis indicates that the regulatory framework of the cities, the lack of standardization and openness of the application programming interfaces and the need for transport-related investments constitute risks for the successful implementation of MaaS in the study areas.

A potential action, which has received a lot of attention, is to introduce Intermediary MaaS Integrators; that is intermediate actors that assemble the offerings from Transport Service Providers (TSPs) and distribute these to MaaS Operators. However, little is known about if and how TSPs and MaaS Operators would appreciate the introduction of Intermediary MaaS Integrators. To address this knowledge gap, this paper explores an attempt to establish a national Intermediary MaaS Integrator in Sweden. The contribution to transportation research is twofold. Firstly, the paper advances the conceptual understanding of Intermediary MaaS Integrators by identifying four defining dimensions: Activities, Management, Processes and Context. Secondly, it deepens the knowledge of Intermediary MaaS Integrators’ value propositions by detailing TSPs’ and prospective MaaS Operators’ hopes and fears vis-à-vis them. Lastly, practical implications for how to facilitate acceptance and adoption are proposed. Intermediary MaaS Integrators should only be introduced if basic incentives for using their services are in place, and if introduced, they should preferably: go beyond offering technical services; have clear, declared objectives; be impartial and capable actors; and carefully consider their launch strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
MaaS for the suburban market: Incorporating carpooling in the mix,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.034,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is often cited as providing an alternative solution to car ownership and car dominated lifestyles. However, MaaS as it currently exists appears to cater mainly for a specific segment of society – those who live close enough to walk to good quality public transport for daily journeys and close enough to access car share/car rental for other trips which public transport cannot serve. By default, this is limited to large, dense urban areas. This paper considers the evolution of intermodal journey planning that incorporates carpooling with public transport in the transition towards MaaS for suburban areas. It introduces a new journey planning App (known as RideMyRoute) that allows users to discover and make connected journeys involving carpooling and public transport, presenting key aspects of its design, development and testing. Results from a trial of the RideMyRoute App in four European test sites (Canton Ticino, Brussels, Zagreb and Ljubljana) revealed that the App was able to suggest trip planning solutions which included carpool options for one in five journey planning solutions and that the majority (85%) of these were solutions that involved connection from carpool to public transport. This is a significant advance on what is currently available through existing carpool provider systems or journey planning apps/services and could potentially increase the attractiveness of MaaS options in suburban markets. However, quality of data feeding the App from external sources remained an issue, as it is with all MaaS systems, and recommendations for future practice are presented. In conclusion, the new intermodal trip planning algorithm and data structure supporting it provide a fundamental stepping stone towards incorporating carpool services within MaaS-type offerings in the future.",0965-8564,Not found
Development and implementation of Mobility-as-a-Service – A qualitative study of barriers and enabling factors,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.028,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) has been argued as part of the solution to prevalent transport problems. However, progress from pilots to large-scale implementation has hitherto been slow. The aim of the research reported in this paper was to empirically and in-depth investigate how, and to what extent, different factors affect the development and implementation of MaaS. A framework was developed, with a basis in institutional theory and the postulation that formal as well informal factors on different analytical levels (macro, meso and micro) must be considered. The research was organised as a multiple case study in Finland and Sweden and a qualitative approach was chosen for data collection and analysis. A number of factors with a claimed impact on the development and implementation of MaaS was revealed. At the macro level, these factors included legislation concerning transport, innovation and public administration, and the presence (or not) of a shared vision for MaaS. At the meso level, (the lack of) appropriate business models, cultures of collaboration, and assumed roles and responsibilities within the MaaS ecosystem were identified as significant factors. At the micro level, people’s attitudes and habits were recognised as important factors to be considered. However, how the ‘S’ in MaaS fits (or not) the transport needs of the individual/household appears to play a more important role in adoption or rejection of MaaS than what has often been acknowledged in previous papers on MaaS. The findings presented in this paper provide several implications for public and private sector actors. Law-making authorities can facilitate MaaS developments by adjusting relevant regulations and policies such as transport-related subsidies, taxation policies and the definition of public transport. Regional and local authorities could additionally contribute to creating conducive conditions for MaaS by, for example, planning urban designs and transport infrastructures to support service-based travelling. Moreover, private actors have key roles to play in future MaaS developments, as both public and private transport services are needed if MaaS is to become a viable alternative to privately owned cars. Thus, the advance of MaaS business models that benefit all involved actors is vital for the prosperity of the emerging MaaS ecosystem.",0965-8564,Not found
Public preferences for mobility as a service: Insights from stated preference surveys,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.031,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"As mobility as a service (MaaS) continues to evolve with increasing interest throughout many countries, a key driver of its success will be the take up by the community of users seeking an alternative way of accessing individual modal options. Whether a packaging of modal services into a mobility bundle will appeal to the travelling population will depend on what appeal such packages can offer compared to purchasing travel via mode-specific outlets. This paper is one of a growing number exploring the role that everyday travel needs and socio-economic setting might play in defining mobility plans that gather significant appeal from the community. Building on our research in Sydney, Australia, we undertake a stated choice analysis in Tyneside, UK to see the extent to which differences in preferences and possible similarities exist in the demand for different subscription models and willingness to pay for mobility services in the two settings. Barriers to a widespread adoption of MaaS are also analysed, as are the potential impacts of MaaS adoption on public transport use and the way people access public transport services. A decision supporting system was developed to translate the modelling results into a practical and user-friendly tool for MaaS developers/innovators to assess market potential based on customer willingness to pay.",0965-8564,Not found
Organizing integrated services in mobility-as-a-service systems: Principles of alliance formation applied to a MaaS-pilot in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.036,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) involves integration of various forms of public and private transport services into a single mobility service, accessible on demand. For MaaS to become successful, different suppliers of transport services have to cooperate in alliances in order to bring new benefits in the short and long term. Past experience demonstrates that this is a challenge, and existing transport providers are struggling with this cooperation. Various factors, including divergent interests of stakeholders, may limit the formation of such alliances. In this paper, we resort to the theories of alliance formation to extend our understanding of the formation of alliances within MaaS. Based on the economic, sociological and business literature we propose a conceptual model and formulate ten fundamental propositions for alliance formation to offer MaaS systems. The model takes the perspective of business firms for whom the institutional environment is an exogenous influence. We then apply this conceptual alliance-formation-model for a MaaS-pilot in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Stakeholders within this pilot were interviewed on their conditions for forming an alliance. It appears that shared goals, limited risks for the partners involved, trust, and stimulating public actions are crucial for a successful alliance. For the pilot, however, learning appears to be the main motive for the firms to get involved. For future transition from the exploration to the exploitation phase of MaaS alliance, these results should be taken into account. The framework and the propositions developed in this paper could be adopted as the necessary preconditions for designing a proper governance structure for providing MaaS services.",0965-8564,Not found
Assessing the welfare impacts of Shared Mobility and Mobility as a Service (MaaS),10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.027,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is an attempt to overcome market segmentation by offering transport services tailored to the individual traveler's needs. An alternative to prior investment into single mobility tools, it may allow less biased mode choice decisions. Such a setting favors shared modes, where fixed costs can be apportioned among a large number of users. In turn, car-sharing, bike-sharing or ride-hailing may themselves become efficient alternatives to public transport. Although early field studies confirm the expected changes away from private car use and towards public or shared modes, impacts are yet to be studied for larger transport systems. This research conducts a first joint simulation of car-sharing, bike-sharing and ride-hailing for a city-scale transport system using MATSim. Results show that in Zurich, through less biased mode choice decisions alone, transport-related energy consumption can be reduced by 25%. In addition, introduction of car-sharing and bike-sharing schemes may increase transport system energy efficiency by up to 7%, whereas the impact of ride-hailing appears less positive. Efficiency gains may be higher if shared modes were used as a substitute for public transport in lower-density areas. In summary, a MaaS scheme with shared mobility may allow to slightly increase system efficiency (travel times & cost), while substantially reducing energy consumption.",0965-8564,Not found
Mobility as a service (MaaS): Charting a future context,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.030,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"This overview article proposes a revised approach to improve the urban realm, against the backdrop of new models for delivering transport services as digitalisation, collaborative consumption and autonomous technologies take hold. We propose the concept of modal efficiency illustrated through a conceptual framework situating both existing and emerging modes of transport around spatial and temporal dimensions. This framework helps us evaluate how the push towards smaller and more flexible transport services in questionable settings can have significant and adverse effects on road capacity, increasing congestion and in the longer term impacting urban form. We propose linking urban land use characteristics to travel price and modal efficiency to improve the broader transport system and guide the sustainable development of our cities. Mobility as a service (MaaS) based on shared mobility and modal integration constitutes a major opportunity to deliver on these ideals, if organised appropriately. Widely diverging service delivery models for MaaS are introduced, including commercially-motivated models (which may exacerbate efficiency issues), and systems which incorporate an institutional overlay. We propose consideration of a government-contracted model for MaaS, where road pricing is incorporated as an input into package price, defined by time of day, geography and modal efficiency. In amidst the hype of new mobility technologies and services, a critical assessment of the realm of possibilities can better inform government policy and ensure that digital disruption occurs to our advantage.",0965-8564,Not found
Exploring motivational mechanisms behind the intention to adopt mobility as a service (MaaS): Insights from Germany,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.022,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Based on digital transformation processes, public mobility is experiencing tremendous and far-reaching change. The use of information and communication technology (ICT) enables disruptive mobility solutions that have recently became known as mobility as a service (MaaS). MaaS promises great economic potential and supports the idea of a more efficient allocation of transport resources. However, the main motivational mechanisms behind travelers’ adoption intention are still unknown. This research identifies key motivational determinants and investigates their structural interrelations. Based on a literature review we first identify the fundamental characteristics of MaaS. Building on this common understanding, we conduct qualitative in-depth interviews with potential end-users to explore motivational acceptance factors. We draw from our inductive findings to postulate a structural causal equation model that captures motivational mechanisms behind the intention to adopt MaaS. Finally, the model will be quantitatively validated based on a comprehensive survey and the use of partial least squares (PLS) analysis. We show that psychological needs play a crucial role in the acceptance of MaaS. The results demonstrate that anticipated advantages of autonomy, competence and the feeling of being related to a social peer group affect hedonic motivation and the expected usefulness of MaaS offerings, which equally affect behavioral intention. We also introduce a novel theoretical construct and show that – in the present disruptive context – cognitive congruency between existing habit schemata and anticipated MaaS usage patterns significantly affect the judgment process and behavioral intention. Finally, important implications for market strategy, product development and policy measures will be discussed.",0965-8564,Not found
Bringing the efficiency of electricity market mechanisms to multimodal mobility across congested transportation systems,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.021,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"A central challenge facing Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is mispricing of its a core input: the use of scarce road space. A transparent real-time market for road use is essential for MaaS to reach its full potential. We focus on how network-wide, real-time markets for road use support MaaS, and how such markets can be developed. In our proposed network-management scheme, roadway tolls (for entire trips – from origin to destination) are determined in a two-stage market hosted by an independent system operator or “ISO”. Service providers purchase the product (the right to use a series of road segments at a reasonably specific time of day) in the day-ahead market. In real-time, the market becomes physical and operates under the principle of open access: road capacity cannot be withheld in real time and its use is determined by users’ decisions, guided by prices and suggested routings. Real-time road-use prices are computed using clearing prices that balance real-time supply and demand. Those with pre-paid slots can be paid to delay their travel, to create space for high bidders during periods of suddenly low capacity or unexpectedly high demand. Such policies and programs can avoid excessive congestion, provide reliable travel times, and keep traffic moving, especially as automation makes car and truck travel easier. Such policies are critical in helping cities and regions avoid gridlock. They ensure that travelers internalize congestion externalities, while enabling MaaS and other transport providers to deliver higher-quality mobility service for all travelers. Thoughtful marriage of week-ahead, day-ahead and real-time road pricing for travelers on congested networks can deliver efficient transportation systems that save time and energy, while providing signals for optimal infrastructure investment.",0965-8564,Not found
India's shift from mass transit to MaaS transit: Insights from Kochi,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.037,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Kochi is the first Indian city to take concrete action on multimodal integration. The city is shifting from the recently hyped mass transit-based mobility to Mobility as a Service (MaaS), by weaving traditionally dominant transport modes – water ferry, auto-rickshaw and city bus along with the newly operational Kochi Metro Rail into one service fabric. This paper explores the case of Kochi based on the core characteristics of MaaS and attempts to understand how the new system is different from the traditional system post the multimodal integration anchored by Kochi Metro Rail Limited. The case reveals that Kochi’s ‘MaaS’ model has fostered several systemic and functional changes in the city public transport. Institutional rearrangement, inclusion of actors, recognition to informal transport service, upgradation and re-organisation of resources for operational efficiency, solution of territorial conflicts - these are a few of the positive changes. The paper highlights MaaS’s ability to augment mobility governance and service provision specific to developing nations’ context. It also projects a learning curve for other Indian cities to prioritise a MaaS strategy over construction of mass transit in isolation.",0965-8564,Not found

Transportation service bundling – For whose benefit? Consumer valuation of pure bundling in the passenger transportation market,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.023,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Novel approaches to service bundling in the passenger transportation market are enabled by technology driven innovations and give rise to so called Mobility as a Service (MaaS) concepts. These approaches promise to increase the accessibility of existing public transportation services, possibly decrease car ownership rates and lower the environmental burden of the transportation system. However, the potential effects of comprehensive service bundles in the passenger transportation market are still largely unclear. In a competitive market, the potential success of MaaS bundles follows consumer valuation of the bundles as compared to valuation of stand-alone services. Thus, the difference between the bundle and sum-of-parts willingness to pay (WTP) is an indicator for the valuation of the bundling itself (which includes service integration valuation) and effects the competitiveness of the service bundles. In this study, several discrete choice experiments were conducted to indirectly estimate consumers' WTP for stand-alone transportation services and service bundles. The results indicate that public transportation, car sharing, and park and ride services are valuated significantly higher when offered in a bundle instead of as a stand-alone service. Bicycle-sharing, electrical bicycle (e-bike) sharing and taxi services are valuated lower. Potential consumers also exhibit a high WTP for a smartphone application that integrates the services and manages ticketing and payment. Consequently, subscription-based pure bundles for all transportation modes may not be the optimal strategy for mobility providers. Instead, it may be better to bundle public transportation with car sharing and park and ride to exploit the higher WTP and offer (electric) bicycle-sharing and taxi services on a pay-per-use basis. In this way, profitability of a public transportation system could be increased.",0965-8564,Not found

MaaS surveillance: Privacy considerations in mobility as a service,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.026,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The concept of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is seeing increasing attention from researchers, industry, and the public sector. MaaS, which posits that traditional models of car ownership and travel may be supplanted by models focused on packages of shared vehicle access, use of public transport, active transport, and teleworking, is currently viewed as having potential beneficial impacts including reductions in single-occupancy vehicle trips, with concomitant reductions in travel cost, congestion, and environmental concerns. MaaS, however, relies upon a number of social expectations, including trust, reliability, and transparency, each of which is reliant upon both the social network that enables MaaS to work efficiently, and upon the ways in which data are handled within the enabling framework. In light of this, it is anticipated that the recently-enacted General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has the potential to significantly impact upon the further implementation of MaaS. MaaS services are predicated upon the sharing of personal travel information (vehicle availability, origins, destinations, financial information, social network data, etc.) that, under GDPR, may be considered personal, subject to the regulations and restrictions this categorisation implies. For MaaS to work in a European context, then, it must be responsive to GDPR requirements related to issues such as Privacy by Design, Consent, and Protection. In this paper, we explore the concept of MaaS in relation to privacy considerations raised by GDPR requirements, with attention to methods and techniques related to relevant data acquisition, sharing, and protection processes. A case study of the Whim application’s privacy policy is presented to demonstrate the potential implications of this policy in an applied context.",0965-8564,Not found
Limitations to the car-substitution effect of MaaS. Findings from a Belgian pilot study,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.032,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) has received widespread attention over the past couple of years amongst scholars, businesses, policymakers and mainstream media. Most coverage is oriented towards its possible gains for traveling individuals and the travel industry, while still lacking conceptual clarity and sufficient detail about its potential acceptance by the general public. This leads to varying perspectives on what MaaS precisely is and will be in the near future. In this study, we reflect upon the relationship between MaaS use and private car ownership, based on insights gained from a MaaS pilot study organized mid-2017 in Ghent (Belgium). This exploratory pilot study targeted 100 car-owning participants (i.e., Ghent University employees) and explored how these motivated people can replace or significantly reduce car use in return for a monthly mobility budget which they could spend on MaaS services. The study reveals that most respondents were apt to explore MaaS services (especially public transport and car sharing services), but a clear reduction of private car use remained difficult in a real-life setting. Despite being highly motivated to reduce car use and being given incentives, participants faced considerable difficulties in bypassing their personal car, especially for (non-repetitive) leisure trips. By drawing parallels with a similar debate in the transport literature from a couple of decades ago, we suggest that MaaS should be regarded as a complement – rather than a substitution – of private car use in the near future. The relationship between MaaS use and car ownership might in reality be more complex than generally acknowledged. In addressing these parallels, the paper opens up new critical questions for MaaS research in the future.",0965-8564,Not found

However, a precondition for the successful implementation and diffusion of MaaS is public acceptance. In this paper, the latent demand for MaaS is estimated using a choice model based on a stated preference survey, conducted in the Netherlands. Specifically, a sequential experimental design approach based on portfolio choice is developed. It consists of two steps aimed to investigate (i) individual intention to subscribe to MaaS and preferences for bundle configurations, (ii) willingness to pay for extra features of the service. This article reports results of the analysis of the first step of the experiment. Two different mixed logit models are estimated to capture unobserved heterogeneity in individual’s preferences. First, a binary mixed logit model is formulated to estimate the effect of service attributes, social influence, socio-demographics and transportation-related characteristics on the decision to subscribe. Then, a mixed logit model is formulated to analyze the effects of transportation mode pricing schemes, and cross effects between transportation modes and individual characteristics on the choice which transportation modes to include in the subscription. The estimation results indicate that, overall, respondents are not yet inclined to subscribe to this new service. The service attribute characteristics, especially the price of the monthly subscription, and the social influence variables have an important effect on the subscription intention. The results also show that public transportation is the most preferred transportation mode, revealing that it may play a key role in MaaS platforms. The decision to subscribe and the choice which transportation modes to include in the bundle, appear to be significantly related to socio-demographic profiles and individuals’ transportation-related characteristics. The findings can be used as a valuable source of information for transportation planners and policy makers.",0965-8564,Not found
Mobility as a service in community transport in Australia: Can it provide a sustainable future?,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.001,131,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is seen as a transition from mobility being satisfied by a dominant car ownership model to a service model where mobility needs are met by a multimodal suite of services. The research environment of MaaS is heavily driven by the younger generation’s travel behaviour which appears to be less dominated by car ownership (following the peak car literature) and by their interest in all things technological, particularly their smart phones. However, this paper is looking at a different but very specific segment of the population in Australia that have their accessibility provided by Community Transport (CT), focusing specifically on New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (QLD). Arguably, this population segment is the complete antithesis of the younger generation in terms of chasing technological change but in other ways, for example, a lack of access to private cars, shows some similarities. This paper is motivated by likely changes in funding for CT providers. Currently CT providers receive a supply side subsidy but there are plans to introduce funding to be placed directly with clients, in the form of person centred funding (PCF). Clients will then have a single budget to purchase mobility along with other services they require. The paper investigates the mobility services which comprise bundles that CT clients would be willing to pay in the new era of PCF. Five participating CT providers from a cross section of operating areas recruited clients to take part in a stated choice experiment, processed by a computer assisted personal interview (CAPI). Advanced choice models are used to develop models using the behavioural data collected by the CAPI and estimates of a CT client’s willingness to pay (WTP) for the MaaS bundle are presented. WTP provides a ceiling for pricing the elements within a MaaS bundle which is an important part of the CT providers’ future strategy. The WTP estimates were much smaller than the CT providers’ unit costs of providing the service. This poses a challenge for CT providers in the creation of mobiltiy bundles which cover costs, suggesting that the possible transition to PCF using MaaS bundles will not be an easy process and will require significant education as to the cost of provision. The paper concludes with some suggestions as to how CT providers could make the transition to PCF building on the evidence of this research.",0965-8564,Not found

However, noncompliance behavior undermines the effectiveness and sustainability of such policies. This study focuses on investigating the characteristics of noncompliance behavior under two vehicle restriction policies, namely, one-day-per-week (ODPW) and odd-and-even (OAE) policies. On the basis of license plate recognition data that record the traffic condition under ODPW and OAE policies in Langfang, China, descriptive statistics are used to illustrate the characteristics of noncompliance with the policies. Furthermore, a zero-inflated model is used to determine the manner in which influencing factors (i.e., local versus external indicator, unrestricted travel rate, daily travel distance within the urban restriction area, and distance between the source intersection and central business district) affect noncompliance frequency. Results show that under the two policies, holding a nonlocal license plate, traveling a long distance daily in the urban restriction area, and departing from a location far from the city center increase the probability of noncompliance behavior of individuals. However, unrestricted travel rate, which represents the frequency of vehicle trips on unrestricted days, exhibits different influences on noncompliance behavior under the two policies.

Effect of land use on shopping trips in station areas: Examining sensitivity to scale,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.029,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Land use planning has been emphasised by both planners and researchers in providing incentives for local shopping. This study advances the body of knowledge by investigating land use and shopping trips in the catchment area for the metro station nearest to home, a unique context that serves both as a shopping destination and a transit origin for further shopping opportunities. Negative binomial and Tobit regressions were applied respectively to examine the effect of land use density on weekly shopping frequency in the station area nearest to home, and its share of individual’s total shopping. The impact of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) on these statistical relationships was addressed, with land use densities objectively measured in seven spatial scales using a radial buffer scheme. Results from all regressions suggest the existence of MAUP in influencing the sign, significance and size of the station area land use effects on shopping trips. A nuanced disaggregation of service types identifies both complementary and competitive relations among services, even under the same generic category, such as dining. The results show that model adopting 400 m radial buffer as measurement scale accumulates greater effect of service land use on station area shopping frequency, while model adopting the 1200 m scale accumulates greater effect of service land use on the station area shopping’s share of individual’s total shopping. This paper presents the sensitivity of effect of land use on shopping trips in station areas to the spatial scale of land use measurement.

In this study we analyze the residential location choice, travel behavior and travel attitudes of young versus older adults (respectively born after 1984 and before 1985), using 1376 recently relocated residents from the city of Ghent (Belgium). Results indicate that travel mode frequency does not considerably differ between young and older adults, although young adults – compared to older adults – live more often in urban-type neighborhoods. This might be partly explained by young adults’ relatively positive attitudes towards car use and negative attitudes towards walking and low-traffic investments. These attitudes consequently seem to counterbalance the effects of the residential neighborhood on travel mode frequency. The fact that respondents’ travel attitudes are often not in line with their chosen residential neighborhood suggests limited self-selection effects. Results from this study partly contradict earlier findings on young adults’ travel behavior and indicate that further research is needed on the links between travel behavior, attitudes and residential location choice of different age groups.",0965-8564,Not found
Effects of smartphone application usage on mobility choices,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.024,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper examines the impacts of smartphone application usage on mobility choice dimensions, such as individuals’ visits to new places, individuals’ trips planned in groups, their participation at social gatherings, and vehicle kilometers traveled. It uses data from the Smartphone Use and Travel Choice Survey 2015, which was conducted exclusively on smartphone users of Halifax, Canada. A latent class random parameter logit (LCRPL) modeling technique is applied in this study that provides a better understanding of the effects of smartphone application usage on mobility choices. The model results offer behavioral insights regarding the influence of individuals’ attitudes, travel characteristics, built environment and accessibility measures on the relationship between smartphone application usage and mobility choices. For instance, living in the higher mixed land-use areas, individuals are less likely to increase their vehicle kilometers traveled due to smartphone application usage, especially if they are tech savvy. Such individuals tend to increase their participation in social gatherings. One of the unique features of this study is that it explores the effects of individuals’ smartphone application usage on mobility choices in terms of their attitudes. The study reveals that in case of people with positive attitude towards sustainable travel, smartphone application usage tends to decrease vehicle kilometers traveled, new place visits and planned group trips, however, increase participation in social gatherings. Results of this study provide critical behavioral insights that could be useful for transportation planners and policy makers to develop flexible policy interventions.",0965-8564,Not found
A passenger-pedestrian model to assess platform and train usage from automated data,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.032,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"We present a transit model that, based on automated fare collection and train tracking data, describes pedestrian movements in train stations and vehicle-specific train ridership distributions. Our approach differs from existing models in that we describe on-board passenger dynamics and pedestrian dynamics at stations in a joint framework. We assume that travelers first decide on the train(s) they will take, and then pursue their journey through the network by successively choosing pedestrian paths, waiting positions on platforms, and specific train cars. Travelers explicitly maximize their travel utility. We model how crowding influences their walking speeds, and how it affects travel utility both at stations and on-board. To illustrate the framework, we present a real case study of a major Dutch rail corridor, for which we collect a rich set of passenger, pedestrian and train operation data. We observe a good agreement of model estimates with empirical observations, and discuss the use of the model for various transit-related problems including level-of-service assessment, crowding estimation, transit optimization, and integrated investment appraisal.",0965-8564,Not found
Persistent and temporary inefficiency in airport cost function: An application to Italy,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.016,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"We study an airport cost function with a four-random components stochastic frontier model that split the inefficiency in two parts: (1) persistent (long-run) and (2) temporary (short-run). We analyze as determinant of both inefficiency types several exogenous factors such as the airport ownership and LCCs share. We apply the model to the Italian airport system during the period 2010–15. We find that (1) average total cost inefficiency is 14%, and that a it is mainly due to temporary inefficiency, (2) that work load units have the largest cost–output elasticity (+0.31%), (3) that price of airport services has the largest cost-input elasticity (+0.50%) while labor has a +0.41% cost elasticity and capital only a +0.09% cost elasticity. There is also evidence of economies of scale. Moreover we find that LCCs reduce both types of inefficiency and that private airports are more cost efficient than public ones. These findings have interesting managerial (e.g., strictly monitoring service costs, expand LCCs flights) and policy (e.g., provide incentive to reduce temporary inefficiency, push airport privatization) implications.",0965-8564,Not found
Effect of passenger encumbrance and mobility aid use on dwell time variability in low-floor transit vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.002,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Public transit serves users with a broad range of physical capabilities and design needs. However information about the operational effects of diverse users interacting with the transit system is scarce. This paper examined the occurrence and effects of boarding and alighting passengers with mobility aids (wheelchairs, scooters, walkers and canes), or with large items (carts, strollers, bicycles, or carrying an infant) on bus stop dwell time in a fixed-route bus service. On-board video data from low-floor public transit buses serving Ann Arbor, Michigan were used from 199 bus stops with at least one passenger boarding or alighting with a mobility aid or encumbered with a large item, and an additional 1642 bus stops without any mobility aids or encumbrances. A sequence of linear regression models examined the relationship between dwell time and the addition of variables representing passengers with mobility aids and encumbrances, and use of the on-vehicle access ramp, beyond explanatory variables typically used in dwell time analysis. Accounting for passengers boarding/alighting with mobility aids and encumbrances (p < 0.001) and use of the access ramp (p < 0.001) increased the variance explanation of a dwell time model based on boarding passengers by fare payment, alighting passengers by door use, and passenger load from 46% to 56%. Results indicate distinct patterns in the durations for boarding and alighting by passengers with vs. without mobility aids and encumbrances, and when a ramp is used by wheeled mobility users vs. ambulatory passengers with walking aids. The findings suggest that accounting for the presence of passengers with mobility aids or encumbrances and ramp use in dwell time analyses could help transit operators make their service operationally more efficient and inclusive for all passengers and encourage more use of fixed-route transit among individuals with disabilities.",0965-8564,Not found
Market development of autonomous driving in Germany,10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.001,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper presents a model to predict the market penetration of autonomous cars for passenger transportation, focussing on autonomous taxis without a steering wheel. For this, a discrete system dynamics model was created and evaluated where the input parameters have been taken from the literature and a survey. In this survey, user demands were investigated among 873 participants. It showed that gender, age, job situation, city size and monthly income have an impact on the trust in the technology of autonomous driving as well as on the willingness to use autonomous taxis. In contrast, no evidence of an impact was found for the respondent’s education or the numbers of adults or children in the household. The results indicate that the majority of autonomous driving vehicles will be private and will have a steering wheel within the scope of this study, which covers the time frame until 2040. These are expected to reach 12.4 million units. At the same time, autonomous taxis will enter the market. These are expected to be mainly non-controllable (without a steering wheel), reaching a maximum of 2.4 million units by 2038. This maximum mainly depends on the trust in the technology as well as on people’s willingness to give up their own car due to cost or usage factors. As an autonomous taxi supports more people on average, the total number of vehicles is expected to drop from 45.1 million to around 41.7 million by 2040. Furthermore, the percentage of people travelling primarily by taxis and public transport is expected to increase from today’s 20.0% to about 32% in 2040. Then, about 19% will use autonomous taxis at least occasionally. Lastly, the vehicle miles travelled are expected to increase by 25% with people switching from public transport to autonomous taxis.",0965-8564,Not found
Why do (or don't) people carpool for long distance trips? A discrete choice experiment in France,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.033,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Long-distance carpooling is an emerging mode in France and Europe, but little is known about monetary values of this mode attributes in transport economics. We conducted a discrete choice experiment to identify and measure the values of attributes of long-distance transport modes for a trip as a driver and as a passenger, with a special focus on carpooling. Around 1.700 French individuals have been surveyed. We use discrete mixed logit models to estimate the probability of mode choice. We find that the value of travel time for a driver who carpools is on average 13% higher than the value of travel time when driving alone in his/her car. The average value of travel time for a carpool trip as passenger is around 26 euros per hour, 60% higher than for a train trip and 20% higher than for a bus trip. Moreover, our study confirms a strong preference for driving solo over taking carpoolers in one’s car. We also show that individuals traveling as carpool passenger incur a “discomfort” cost of on average 4.5 euros per extra passenger in the same vehicle. Finally, we identify robust socio-economic effects affecting the probability of carpooling, especially gender effects. When they drive a car, females are less likely to carpool than male, but they prefer to carpool two passengers over only one passenger.",0965-8564,Not found
Modelling regional accessibility to airports using discrete choice models: An application to a system of regional airports,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.012,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"In this paper, we analyse residents' decisions regarding airport access mode in Apulia, a relatively peripheral multi-airport region in Italy. Both revealed and stated preferences data are used to estimate probabilistic demand models. The results are employed to calculate the relevant elasticities, separately for airport users and non-users, with respect to dedicated existing and planned/potential public transport services. We measure the effectiveness of specific policies/actions aimed at generating a shift from private modes (car and taxi) towards public transport, rationalising mobility towards the existing airports. Accessibility is one of the key factors in airports' provision, and an efficient public transport system might represent both an alternative to opening “local” – often costly and inefficient – airports in the same catchment area and a means to exploit economies of scale aggregating demand for existing airports.",0965-8564,Not found

A study on passengers’ alighting and boarding process at metro platform by computer simulation,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.017,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Passengers’ alighting and boarding process in metro stations has attracted increasing research attention since it has significant influence on the platform passenger distribution as well as the train dwell time. In this study, a field survey was firstly performed in a densely populated metro station at downtown area in Hong Kong to observe passengers’ alighting and boarding characteristics and collect sample data. One commonly existing phenomenon is found that boarding passengers start to get aboard even when there are alighting passengers still inside the metro carriage. This is defined as passengers’ non-compliance behaviors in this paper. In addition, time indicators are defined to measure the alighting and boarding efficiency. Then a microscopic pedestrian simulation model based on the Social Force Model is proposed to simulate the passengers’ alighting and boarding patterns at metro platform. The verification result shows the good applicability of the proposed model to simulate the actual situation. Finally, several simulation tests are conducted to explore the impacts that passengers’ non-compliance behaviors have on the alighting and boarding efficiency in different passenger volume conditions. The simulation result shows that higher level of passengers’ non-compliance behaviors leads to longer passenger’s alighting duration and boarding duration, but the influence on the overall transaction time is related to different passenger volume conditions. Thus, metro station facility could apply different alighting and boarding rules in different passenger volume conditions to increase alighting and boarding efficiency.",0965-8564,Not found
Consumer preferences for on-demand transport in Australia,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.026,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"On-demand transport (ODT) refers to adaptive transport services that use a fleet of vehicles to provide shared flexible transport to consumers, when and where they need it. This study surveyed 3,985 geographically and demographically representative Australians nationwide, to understand consumer demand and willingness to pay for ODT in Australia. Our analysis finds that the current market for ODT services in Australia is small. For example, for an ODT service that costs roughly the same as UberX’s ridesharing service, and offers comparable level-of-service, our analysis predicts that only 17 per cent of the Australian population can be expected to use the service a few times a week or more. However, shared electric autonomous vehicles could significantly change the business case for ODT services, by enabling on-demand door-to-door transport services at a fractional cost of similar existing services. Our analysis finds that while consumers are willing to pay, on average, 0.28$/km more to avoid sharing a vehicle with other passengers, 0.17$/km more for door-to-door service, and 0.10$/km to be able to book the service in real time, cost is the most important determinant of ODT use (of the service attributes included in our analysis). For an ODT service that provides the same level-of-service as UberX, but at a fractional cost of $0.30 per km, 31 per cent of the Australian population can be expected to use the service a few times a week or more. And this figure is likely to be larger once we account for more long-term changes in lifestyles that might accompany the introduction of these services. We find that frequency of ODT use is strongly correlated with age and lifecycle stage: young individuals who are employed full-time are likely to use ODT most frequently; older adults who have retired from the workforce and whose children have left home are likely to be infrequent users. Overall, our analysis indicates that ODT services have the ability to both increase public transport use among existing public transport customers, and to draw new customers to public transport services.",0965-8564,Not found
Unfolding barriers for urban mobility plan in small and medium municipalities – A case study in Brazil,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.006,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper investigated barriers for the design and implementation of Urban Mobility Plans in small and medium-sized cities in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. To achieve this objective an exploratory survey was carried out with specialists involved in the urban planning processes of such cities. A total of 22 barriers were listed, and, using the Keiser criterion, these barriers were grouped into seven factors: (1) resources availability; (2) practical and technological; (3) city characteristics; (4) budget constrains; (5) social and cultural; (6) organizational; and (7) lack of infrastructure for sustainable vehicles; a grouping that, in general, was similar to those found in the literature. The first main barrier encountered in the municipalities analyzed were difficulties in finding mobility solutions that adequately meet all stakeholders’ needs, followed by budget constraints for implementing actions toward more sustainable transport modes. Even though the complexity of the actors involved is seen as one of the main barriers to urban planning, it is still necessary to effectively involve the population in the decision-making process, so that all needs are considered, and consensual solutions are reached. Through the Spearman correlation method, other barriers closely associated with the first main barrier were reconciling the mobility needs of the population with the already existing infrastructure and preference for motor vehicles. For the second main barrier, other closely correlated variables were insufficient data collection for the preparation of urban mobility plans and lack of qualified workforce within municipal agencies to both elaborate and implement the actions contained in the plans. These correlations suggest that a deficient budget hinders the development of sustainable urban mobility in several stages of the process, including the diagnosis phase (data collection).",0965-8564,Not found
Changes in travel mode use over the life course with partner interactions in couple households,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.031,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"The paper links the mobility biography approach with studies on intra-household interactions between partners in travel. It does so by developing a multi-group path model – a structural equation model without latent variables – of changes in car use over time as a function of changes in activity and trip patterns, path dependency (baseline car use), life course changes, and the respective respondent's partner's car use, activity and trip patterns. In terms of life course changes, the paper accounts for (gradual, rather than abrupt) changes in paid and unpaid worktime, and the birth of a first or higher-order (i.e. second or further) child. The model further categorises respondents by gender. It focuses on couples who share one car. A model for multi-car households is estimated for comparison. The results show multiple interactions between two partners at the baseline as well as over time. The effects of the birth of a child are less clear than expected. Generally, they suggest that increases in driving are primarily an outcome of higher-order births, especially in one-car households. Policy conclusions are (1) that it may be overly optimistic to assume that the birth of a child can be utilised as a 'window of opportunity' to reduce driving, and (2) that social interactions between partners should be taken into account in policy concepts.",0965-8564,Not found

The experienced mode choice set and its determinants: Commuting trips in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.027,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Active modes take up an increasingly important place on the global policy-making agenda. In the Netherlands, a country that is well-known for its high shares of walking and cycling, the government aims at achieving a modal shift among 200,000 commuting car drivers towards using the bicycle. To this end, policy measures need to be introduced. When the aim is to achieve a modal switch over an enduring period of time, it is more relevant to know the likelihood of including or excluding a mode in the mode choice set, compared to choosing a mode for a single trip. Therefore, we investigate the formation of the experienced choice set (set of modes used over a long period of time), where the aim is to identify determinants that influence the inclusion or exclusion of a mode in this set. We estimate discrete choice models, based on survey data from the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN) and a complementary survey, where individuals were asked to report the frequency of using certain modes of transport for commuting trips over the course of half a year. This study shows that the experienced choice set for commuting is unimodal for the majority of the individuals, and remains constant over time for most individuals. Reimbursement by the employer for using a certain mode is the most important determinant influencing the experienced choice set, followed by ownership characteristics and urban density. We show that the mode choice set formation depends on more determinants than previously assumed.",0965-8564,Not found

By contrast, existing literature considers only domestic markets finding a more moderate fare drop of about 3% in domestic markets by the bankrupt carrier, with mixed results on the fare drop by competitors.",0965-8564,Not found
Analysis of multi-modal commute behavior with feeding and competing ridesplitting services,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.018,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Public transit is an essential travel mode in many urban areas. Emerging dynamic ridesplitting programs provided by transportation network companies (TNCs) can be a double-edged sword to public transit. On the one hand, the program provides convenient services to solve first- and last-mile problems. On the other hand, long-distance ridesplitting services may also draw passengers away from public transit. In this paper, we propose a network model to analyze multi-modal commute behavior with ridesplitting programs as both feeders and competitors to public transit, which is with limited accessibility to passengers. The ridesplitting priority and ridesplitting fare ratio (i.e., ridesplitting fare over non-ridesplitting fare) are incorporated as operational strategies of the TNC. Through numerical studies, we find that a significant number of public transit passengers will shift to long-distance ridesplitting services under low fare ratios; and a high ridesplitting priority can lead to a demand drawback for long-distance ridesplitting, which raises public transit ridership. To maintain public transit ridership, the TNC needs to keep a high fare ratio and a high priority; meanwhile, the number of short-distance ridesplitting orders can also decrease dramatically, which may lead to a loss in unit time revenue of the TNC. We note that a win–win condition can be reached through a separated discount strategy for first- and last-mile ridesplitting services. Such a strategy can both increase the number of short-distance ridesplitting orders for the TNC and boost transit ridership for the government, as well as provide low-cost services to passengers.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact of public transport strikes on the road network: The case of Athens,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.022,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Public transport strikes comprise a form of traffic disruption affecting “normal” traveller behaviour, and result in the increase of traffic congestion, traffic accidents and air pollution. Travellers modify their trip characteristics in anticipation of strike effects, while their behaviour depends on various factors including individual characteristics, trip flexibility, available transport modes and attitudes towards them. This study explores the effect of public transport strikes on traffic conditions utilising loop detector data and, in particular, examining the impacts on traffic flow, mean speed and travel time. The city of Athens is used as a reference case. The analysis employs descriptive statistics, as well as the design of generalised linear models to capture the impact of public transport strikes on traffic conditions, and to define the contributing spatio-temporal factors affecting the impacts. Study results highlighted the increase of congestion as expressed through all explored indicators, as a result of the strikes. In particular, increased traffic flow (up to 30%), reduced mean speed (up to 27%) and increased travel times (up to 25%) were observed at the majority of the explored sites. Public transport strike coverage and time of day were found to be the dominant factors. Other contributing factors were found to be day of the week and site-specific characteristics including: the existence of tolls; site location relative to the centre of Athens; and the existence of traffic lights on the explored links. The results of this study can form the basis for the design and implementation of targeted countermeasures that mitigate congestion effects, as well as measures promoting green transport resulting in travellers adopting more sustainable trip routines in the city of Athens.",0965-8564,Not found
The evolving market entry strategy: A comparative study of Southwest and JetBlue,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.009,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper studies the market entry patterns and evolving strategies adopted by Southwest and JetBlue. Based on the quarterly data from US T100 Domestic Segment database, we trace Southwest’s successful market entries from 1993 to 2016, and those of JetBlue from 2000 to 2016, and estimate a set of discrete choice models to investigate the factors that may attract or deter route entries by Southwest and JetBlue. These factors reflect route distance, traffic demand, market power of the carriers, route competition, and connectivity and traffic concentration at endpoint airports, etc. The paper also examines the similarity and dissimilarity between Southwest and JetBlue with respect to the effects of these factors on their entry decisions, and how their route entry decisions have evolved over time. Our results indicate that both Southwest and JetBlue are more likely to enter routes where they have higher market share in terms of traffic and connectivity at endpoint airports, but they are less likely to enter routes involving endpoint airports with higher concentration in either traffic or connectivity. While Southwest appears to prefer routes with short to medium distance in the 1990s, it has started to target longer distance routes since 2000. JetBlue has consistently preferred longer distance routes. While the number of legacy rivals on a given route may deter market entry by Southwest, it does not appear to have any significant effect on the entry decisions by JetBlue. Moreover, the presence of other LCCs may have deterred the market entry by Southwest during the 1993–1999 period, and by JetBlue during the 2000–2006 period, its entry-deterrence effects has been becoming less important as the two airlines continue their growth and market expansion. The results further suggest that Southwest has continued to be hesitant to enter routes that have asymmetric traffic volume at endpoint airports, but it has become more drawn to routes with broader connections and higher traffic at endpoint airports as it moves into the business passenger segment.",0965-8564,Not found
Factors affecting the adoption and use of urban air mobility,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.020,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Technological advances have recently led to the development of urban air mobility (UAM), an alternative transportation mode with several concepts including vehicles operated by on-demand fully-automated vertical take-off and landing aircraft (VTOL) for intra-city passenger transportation. However, despite a growing interest in UAM, understanding users’ perceptions to it remains limited. This research aims to identify and quantify the factors affecting the adoption and use of UAM, based on relevant tools from the literature, such as recurring factors in studies on aerial vehicle concepts, ground autonomous vehicles, but also acceptance models, such as the Technology Acceptance Model by Davis et al. (1989). A stated-preference survey was developed to assess the perception of users in terms of adoption time horizon, including options such as the first six years of the service’s implementation, “unsure”, and “never”. The obtained results were evaluated using exploratory factor analyses, and the specification and estimation of suitable discrete choice models, multinomial logit models (MNLs) and ordered logit models (OLMs), with adoption time horizon as dependent variable. Findings revealed the importance of safety and trust, affinity to automation, data concerns, social attitude, and socio-demographics for adoption. Factors, such as the value of time savings, the perception of automation costs, and service reliability, were also found to be highly influential. There was also an indication that skeptical respondents, i.e. answering “unsure”, had a behavior similar to late and non-adopters, i.e. adoption time horizon higher than six years or answering “never”.

A comprehensive method for the robustness assessment of high-speed rail network with operation data: A case in China,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.019,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"High-speed rail (HSR) has become a critical infrastructure and even has formed a network in some countries, which plays an increasingly significant part in the modern transport system and exerts increasingly obvious impacts on regional economic activity and human mobility. Although its interruption may cause serious consequences, researching its robustness doesn’t attract attention until recent years. Based on previous researches on the issue, this paper proposes a comprehensive method to assess the robustness of high-speed rail network (HSRN) by combining the network function features with network topology features and modeling HSRN as a two-layer network based on the high-speed trains running in the network, in which the travel time and passenger flow are taken into account. Finally, taking China’s HSRN (CHSRN) as a case study, this paper investigates the failure effects of HSR stations and high-speed trains on the robustness of CHSRN, especially the space-time failure effects of high-speed trains at three typical HSR stations. Results reveal that the failure effects of trains at the selected stations on the performance of CHSRN are limited, and the failure effects of trains at three typical stations on the performance are different as the different failure time, which is beneficial to prioritize the decisions on maintenance resource allocation and prepare emergency response plans.",0965-8564,Not found
Preference heterogeneity in mode choice for car-sharing and shared automated vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.004,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Membership-based short-term car rental–more popularly referred to in the marketplace and popular media as “car-sharing”–has been expanding rapidly worldwide. The advent of self-driving vehicles is likely to facilitate the growth of car-sharing by addressing a couple of the current barriers, including limited dedicated parking and non-competitive access times. Despite the growing importance of this topic, however, the patterns emerging in the market penetration of automated vehicles in car-sharing programs have not received much attention in the literature because of the relative newness of the automated vehicle technologies enabling them. Towards addressing this research gap in this increasingly important area, this paper presents the results of an Australian survey with a focus on consumer preferences towards car-sharing. A stated preference (SP) methodology was adopted to elicit consumers’ valuation of specified mode-choice related factors. In particular, vehicle self-driving capability, a factor rarely examined in the literature, was provided as an option to participants in the SP survey. To increase the realness of the experiment, SP tasks were pivoted from respondents’ most recent trips. The travel preferences data were analyzed using a random parameter (mixed) logit model. To explore preference heterogeneity, socio-demographic and other factors were interacted with alternative-specific attributes, and their influences on marginal utilities were extracted using simulation analysis. Preference heterogeneity across individuals towards shared automated vehicles (SAVs) was identified. Consistent with the literature, consumers’ experience of using car-sharing appears to have significant influence on household mode choices, increasing the probability of using a diversified mode tools (e.g., TWS and Taxi) and decreasing the likelihood of choosing to use privately owned travel tools, such as private car. Although it has been argued in the literature that females, non-drivers, and the elderly are the most likely to benefit from SAVs, the results of this study reveal that these user groups in fact hold negative opinions about SAVs.

Spatial heterogeneity is modeled by a translog function in the first three explanatory variables, which are dominated by variation in the cross-sectional domain, while the real price of gasoline, which is dominated by variation in the time domain, is treated as an observable common factor. Additional unobservable common factors are controlled for by principal components with heterogenous coefficients, building on previous work of Shi and Lee (2017a), thereby, generalizing the dynamic spatial panel data model with spatial and time period fixed applied in recent studies. It is found that the spatial lag in the dependent variable becomes insignificant due to these extensions. This paper explains the wider implications of this finding for spatial econometric modeling of cross-sectional dependence. In addition, the elasticities of the first three explanatory variables are shown to vary across space and time and to follow a plausible structure. Among other, an important result is that the long run income elasticity of car traffic diminished from 1.0 in 1990 to 0.4 in 2003, and then remained almost constant until the end of our sample period in 2009, i.e., during the peak-car traffic period.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper aims to present a comprehensive comparative empirical analysis focusing on the container shipping (barge) network in the Yangtze and the Rhine. This analysis is supported by extensive datasets on both river basins, incorporates the latest development on both rivers and is grounded on concepts and methods coming from transport geography and economic geography. We find that a large diversity might exist in how inland port systems and related gateway seaports are dealing with cargo flows and supply chains. In view of explaining this diversity, we make a distinction between geographical/nautical aspects, macro-economic factors and institutional/governance factors. In particular, we discuss the role of institutional and governance factors in barge network development by using the concepts of selection, retention and variation.",0965-8564,Not found
Evaluating the interrelationships among inhibitors to intermodal railroad freight transport in emerging economies: A multi-stakeholder perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.023,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Intermodal railroad (IRR) mode of freight transport has been considered as a sustainable and efficient solution for ensuring the sustainability of the freight transport industry, but the IRR transport adoption faces many challenges in real cases. However, so far, studies considered inhibitors of IRR transport under logistics shippers or forwarders' perspectives. Unfortunately, no existing research has evaluated the interrelationships of IRR freight transport inhibitors in emerging economies, nor in Indian Context. This study aims to give a structural model of IRR freight transport inhibitors interrelationships with a case of the Indian freight industry. The considered stakeholders in the present research are academic researchers, freight shippers, and Indian Railways officials’. The considered research framework presents twenty-two inhibitors, that were selected from the previous literature and experts' input. Then, a blend of grey theory and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method (Grey-DEMATEL) was used to identify the causal relationships between the selected inhibitors and the strength of their interrelationships. A Euclidian distance analysis was used to highlight the similarities and differences between stakeholders’ views. All the stakeholders find some common inhibitors such as poor rail freight transport infrastructure, low frequency of freight trains, the poor delivery reliability of rail mode, lack of competition between transport modes, and lack of holistic transportation business model. The unique contribution of present work relies on the fact that no past studies were found, to consider the impact of multiple stakeholders in the intermodal freight business. Moreover, policymakers may take proactive actions to improve the inhibitors of IRR into practices for improving modal balance in emerging economies. Finally, the conclusion and limitations of the present work are highlighted.",0965-8564,Not found
Pricing commercial train path requests based on societal costs,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.005,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"On deregulated railway markets, efficient capacity allocation is important. We study the case where commercial trains and publicly controlled traffic (“commuter trains”) use the same railway infrastructure and hence compete for capacity. We develop a method that can be used by an infrastructure manager trying to allocate capacity in a socially efficient way. The method calculates the loss of societal benefits incurred by changing the commuter train timetable to accommodate a commercial train path request, and based on this calculates a reservation price for the train path request. If the commercial operator’s willingness-to-pay for the train path exceeds the loss of societal benefits, its request is approved. The calculation of these benefits takes into account changes in commuter train passengers’ travel times, waiting times, transfers and crowding, and changes in operating costs for the commuter train operator(s). The method is implemented in a microscopic simulation program, which makes it possible to test the robustness and feasibility of timetable alternatives. We show that the method is possible to apply in practice by demonstrating it in a case study from Stockholm, illustrating the magnitudes of the resulting commercial train path prices. We conclude that marginal societal costs of railway capacity in Stockholm are considerably higher than the current track access charges.",0965-8564,Not found

It is assumed that the willingness to pay is affected by parameters favourable for the susceptibility of DRT services and variables concerning eco-friendliness. To test the assumptions eleven hypothesis are derived. The results imply that a high dependence on EcoBus and ecological motivations lead to a higher willingness to pay for DRT services. There is also evidence that an ecological mindset leads to a lower willingness to pay for motorised transport as a whole. Contrary to expectations, car ownership does not reduce willingness to pay for DRT services.",0965-8564,Not found

Since decisions on the location of bus terminals in large agglomerations determine transportation costs and the quality of service of public transport passengers, the use of multicriteria analysis becomes necessary. In that respect, the intercity bus terminals proposed by 2023 Long-Range Landuse Plan (LRLUP) and 2023 Transportation Master Plan (TMP) of Istanbul are examined based on decision criteria of accessibility and suitability within the environment they are located. The multi-criteria analysis was performed using the additive value (AV) model to evaluate the locations of existing and planned intercity bus terminals in Istanbul based on their specific location characteristics defined. Criteria used in the analysis are the location within the region, population coverage and density, land value, accessibility by highway and public transit modes, availability of land for capacity expansion, and the surrounding land-use and geological characteristics. Based on the design criteria assessed, a general score for the location of each intercity bus-terminal (two existing and nine planned) was calculated using normalized importance weights obtained from an expert survey, and then the terminals were ranked based on their scores calculated for the base (2010 and before) and plan years (2023), respectively. Based on their total score, they were ranked and grouped into three categories as follows: (1) scores higher than 0.75, (2) between 0.51 and 0.75, and (3) equal to or smaller than 0.50. All planned terminals scored equal or higher than 0.50 (two out of nine are in the first category, six are in the second category, and one is in the third category), and this proved that all of them were planned where they were needed. Then, an availability analysis was carried out to identify the configurations of the bus terminals depending on each other, which is deemed to yield their best configuration. The results of this paper will be of relevance to urban and transportation planners facing a decision to make and prioritize transport planning decisions concerning the spatial planning of a metropolitan city based on chosen decision criteria.",0965-8564,Not found
"Whether, when and which: Modelling advanced seat reservations by airline passengers",10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.002,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Motivated by the growing importance of ancillary revenues in the airline industry, we propose a statistical model for Advanced Seat Reservation (ASR). We focus on the questions of whether, when and which seats are selected by passengers. To answer these questions, we employ a discrete time duration model, combined with a multinomial choice model with varying consideration set. Unknown smooth covariate effects are used, along with seat-specific random effect terms for seat selection. The model is applied to a rich dataset of 485,279 bookings on five intercontinental routes, extracted from the complete booking database of a major European airline. We find strong evidence of ‘middle seat avoiding’ and ‘front seat preferring’ effects, along with substantial additional seat-specific heterogeneity. We also show that the probability of making an ASR depends on its price in relation to the ticket price, the distribution channel, the number of days to departure and seasonal effects. These and other insights allow for product differentiation and variable pricing in ASR for each and every seat. In addition, simple variations of the statistical model can also be used for other ancillary products—such as on-board dining and preferential baggage checking—that are purchased in the same way as ASR.",0965-8564,Not found

Mutual forbearance is tacit collusion that directly results from familiarity and deterrence. This paper examines the effect of multimarket contact on airline prices in the Chinese domestic airline market where private and low-cost carriers have been thriving and high-speed rail services growing quickly in the last few years. We find strong evidence supporting the mutual forbearance hypothesis in high revenue markets. We also find that the collusive effect due to increasing multimarket contact is insignificant within the same airline group, whereas multimarket contact between airlines in different airline groups triggers higher airfares.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper applies a Bayesian framework to integrate statistics on regional freight transport with data on regional trade. The resulting data describe freight transport in the Netherlands at the NUTS 3 regional level by NSTR commodity groups, and by type of flow. We distinguish intraregional transport, regional exports and imports, international exports and imports, and regional transit. The contribution of this paper is that conditions driving regional transport flows are reflected more clearly in the data. The results show the relative importance of logistic processes in regional transport in the Netherlands. Similarly, specific regional production patterns are also reflected in the data. The results contribute to the development of more evidence-based, region-specific freight strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
A framework to guide strategic disinvestment in roadway infrastructure considering social vulnerability,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.021,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Strategic disinvestment involves a conscious reallocation of funds to prioritize transportation infrastructure assets in terms of their importance or criticality, and then deliberately shifting limited resources away from lower priority assets toward higher priority assets. While previous investment paradigms considered the economic implications of expanding or maintaining assets versus the alternative of no expansion or no maintenance, disinvestment considers whether it is realistic to attempt to maintain all assets according to their original standards, or if performance standards should be changed or ownership transferred. While the concept of disinvestment has received attention in recent years, there is no established framework for disinvestment actions, potential travel impacts associated with disinvestment actions have not been widely examined, and it is unclear how disinvestment may affect socially vulnerable populations. In this paper, we present a novel framework to guide disinvestment decisions. The framework identifies different disinvestment actions and illustrates the savings, costs, and control tradeoffs associated with those actions. Each action offers different cost-savings and is associated with varying levels of reduced responsibility or obligation. We next introduce a measure of social vulnerability referred to as the Disinvestment Vulnerability Index (DVI) to help identify socially vulnerable populations impacted by disinvestment. We then propose a methodology for identifying a set of least critical or “non-essential” roadway assets as initial candidates for disinvestment, and introduce an approach for quantifying the potential effect of asset-specific disinvestment actions on vulnerable populations. The suggested approach allows decision-makers to “take the first step” in selecting an initial set of potential disinvestment candidates by identifying assets that have a minimal disruptive effect on network-wide travel, while simultaneously considering accessibility and mobility issues related to socially vulnerable populations. We illustrate the approach in the state of Vermont using the state’s travel demand model and data obtained from the U.S. Census.",0965-8564,Not found
Heterogeneity in desired bus service quality from users’ and potential users’ perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.029,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Investigating on transit users’ opinions represents a useful strategy to understand the level of quality of a service, and consequently pursuing the most convenient interventions for satisfying users and improving the service. On the other hand, an important issue for increasing the use of transit systems is linked to the necessity to attract new users, in addition to customize the current users. For this reason, it becomes fundamental to know also the perceptions of people who do not use transit systems with the aim to discover which are the reasons of their travel choices and particularly which are the most relevant transit service aspects for them. In this work, a Stated Preferences (SP) survey was conducted in order to investigate on both transit current and potential users’ preferences. This kind of survey allows potential users opinions to be captured due to its peculiarity of the possibility to propose to interviewees hypothetical services and not only real services, which could not be judged by people who do not use the service. The collected data were adopted to calibrate discrete choice models such as Random Parameters mixed Logit models and Latent Class models. These models allow heterogeneity of users’ opinions to be analysed. Calibrating this kind of models using data collected from both users and potential users permitted to capture the differences among users in their preferences about transit service quality, and the differences among potential users in their desired service quality. Model results showed some interesting findings concerning the differences of categories of users and potential users, and especially the diversity of preferences between people who know well the service and people who could become users even if they have not a real perception of it. We also calculated the Willingness-To-Pay (WTP), which allowed to discover that the WTP values obtained for the potential users are very much higher than the values obtained for the users. The proposed models can be also useful for the practitioners and transit operators to identify the best combination of the quality levels to assign to the various service aspects.",0965-8564,Not found
Drivers and barriers in adopting Mobility as a Service (MaaS) – A latent class cluster analysis of attitudes,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.022,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is expected to significantly change mobility patterns, yet it is still not clear who will embrace this new mobility paradigm and how MaaS will impact passengers’ transportation.

We find five clusters in relation to individuals’ inclinations to adopt MaaS in the context of urban mobility. We characterize each of the clusters, allowing for the examining of different customer segments regarding MaaS. The cluster with the highest inclination for future MaaS adoption is also the largest cluster (representing one third of respondents). Individuals in this cluster have multimodal weekly mobility patterns. On the contrary, current unimodal car users are the least likely to adopt MaaS. We identify high (mobility) ownership need and low technology adoption (present in three of the five clusters) as the main barriers that can hinder MaaS adoption. Policies that directly address these two barriers can stimulate MaaS adoption.",0965-8564,Not found
Mandating the use of the electric taxis: The case of Florence,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.018,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper discusses a policy enacted in 2016 by the city of Florence mandating the use of electric vehicles for the taxi service. We interviewed the taxi license owners (carriers), their co-operatives and the city administrators to evaluate the policy implementation, its acceptability and the cost-competitiveness of electric taxis (e-taxis) with respect to their hybrid and diesel alternatives. Using the data collected during the interviews, we estimated the total cost of ownership (TCO) of e-taxis and their conventional counterparts for the models comprising the Florence taxi fleet. We find that e-taxis already represent a valid alternative to the conventional ones not only from an environmental point of view but also from a private economic one. In particular, when the Florence-specific discounted purchase prices are considered and the base case scenario applies, e-taxis are the cheapest choice in terms of TCO and no financial incentives are needed. When the manufacturer suggested retail prices are considered, e-taxis are slightly less cost-competitive than hybrid taxis but more cost-competitive than the diesel ones. Sensitivity analyses are performed to evaluate the impact of the annual distance travelled, Ecobonus purchase subsidy, net revenue loss, annual percentage rate charged to finance the taxi acquisition and insurance premium.",0965-8564,Not found
"High-speed rail networks, capacity investments and social welfare",10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.011,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"In this paper, we analytically study the performance of two topologies of high-speed rail (HSR) networks: isolated-corridors and grid networks. We evaluate how HSR configuration affects capacity of newly developed infrastructure, profits and social welfare by considering a number of factors, namely economies of traffic density, market size, operating cost and cost of capital. Our investigations focus on a social welfare-maximizing entity which provides HSR train services as well as develops infrastructure. We find that although the grid network allows for more new markets, the isolated-corridors network may perform better in terms of social welfare when the cost of capital is high, the demand in the new markets established by the isolated-corridors network is high, the operating cost (excluding density effect) is high and the traffic density effect is weak. We also identify cases where the optimal network configuration in terms of social welfare may not be optimal in other aspects, such as capacity, consumer surplus and profits. For example, when the density effect is strong, grid network is likely to be socially optimal, but it faces more difficulty in recovering the invest cost comparing with the alterative network.",0965-8564,Not found

A ranking survey was conducted and analyzed unveiling levels of acceptance to the proposed policies for three types of stakeholders (Carriers, Receivers, and Citizens). Though some methodologies attempt to understand stakeholders’ perspectives towards urban freight policies, often only a certain type of stakeholder is considered; perceptions of Citizens are usually overlooked. The results suggest that stakeholders agree on the importance of having space to conduct freight operations in their urban areas. However, different stakeholders perceive policies differently and local context plays a key role, suggesting that decision-makers must consider these aspects before transferring initiatives from other urban settings. When space for freight operations cannot be provided, the results show that Carriers prefer a Receiver-led Consolidation program, Receivers consider an Urban Consolidation Center as the best alternative, and Citizens prefer Off-hour deliveries. While all of the preferred alternatives call for a more active role played by the other stakeholders, they also call for more sustainable practices and move away from traditional, restrictive policies.

Transit reforms in intermediate cities of Colombia: An ex-post evaluation,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.014,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"We use monthly data on transit supply and ridership to evaluate the impact of BRT type reforms in intermediate cities in Colombia. We find that these reforms are associated with a decrease in aggregate transit ridership. This is particularly troubling since it points to a reduction in the attractiveness of public transport for users and a substitution to other potentially more unsustainable modes, such as private vehicles or informal taxi services. We also show that reform reduced fleet size and commercial kilometers supplied and we conjecture that this, together with additional transfers required in the new systems, raised the generalized cost of transport for transit services. We present circumstantial evidence that this conjecture is correct and argue that this was probably the case in other Latin American experiences, such as Santiago, Lima and Bogota (SITP).",0965-8564,Not found
On the impact of vehicle automation on the value of travel time while performing work and leisure activities in a car: Theoretical insights and results from a stated preference survey – A comment,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.019,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This note revises the theoretical insights concerning the Value of Travel Time for automated vehicles as derived in a recent paper in this journal (Correia et al., 2019). That paper concluded that Value of Travel Time in an automated vehicle should be lower than in a conventional vehicle by salary rate, if the traveller works during the trip, and unchanged compared to conventional vehicles, if the traveller engages in leisure activities while travelling. However, these conclusions have limited validity, because the models, upon which they are based, contain a term whose interpretation differs across the models. This note clarifies this interpretation and offers an alternative extended model, which allows comparison across models. The alternative model provides an intuitive result: the facilitation-level of on-board activities determines the reduction of the Value of Travel Time in the automated vehicle. If automated vehicles provide identical work or leisure experience to out-of-vehicle locations, then the opportunity costs of travel time are erased and the Value of Travel Time equals the intrinsic costs of travel, which is strictly smaller than the Value of Travel Time in a conventional vehicle.",0965-8564,Not found
Towards evening paratransit services to complement scheduled public transport in Cape Town: A driver attitudinal survey of alternative policy interventions,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.015,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Cities across the Global South are seeking to improve public transport services, but the presence of large numbers of independent paratransit operators complicate reforms. City officials often seek to eliminate paratransit services in favor of scheduled services; but such reforms have proven impossible to achieve. Cape Town is one such city, whose planning officials are now reconsidering the approach to ‘industry transition’. Realizing that the transition and operating costs of new scheduled services are unsustainable, the City has acknowledged a continued role for paratransit services. The question this raises is how paratransit should be integrated and, more specifically, how paratransit should complement scheduled services at transfer points. This paper reports on findings from a stated choice survey administered to paratransit drivers to understand opinions on potential reforms that the City might use to address issues of mismatched service span and long off-peak headways in service provided by paratransit operators. The research seeks to assist operators in sharing their perspectives outside of a City-structured engagement process and to assist City officials in understanding what reform paths will be most feasible based on driver acceptability and cost to the City.

This paper focuses on an important but neglected aspect in these emerging markets, namely, vehicle recalls. The aim of this study is twofold. The first is to show that a significant difference exists in the number and volume of vehicle recalls between the emerging Chinese market and the established US market; the second is to detect whether this difference can be attributed to the initiator level (voluntary versus involuntary recalls) and/or the firm level (organizational ownership structure and nationality of the foreign partner in international joint ventures). To that end, we quantify the recall performance by means of 4 metrics: total number of recall events per annum (NRE), total number of units recalled per annum (NUR), average number of vehicles recalled per event per annum (NRPE), and recall rate (RR); for each of these, we benchmark the US market and assess the relative performance of the investigated market using a bootstrap method. The empirical results indicate that the recall metrics in the Chinese market have underperformed relative to those of the established market. This is extremely pertinent in light of the current “Going Out” policy put forward by the Chinese government, as subpar quality awareness hampers the successful access of Chinese automakers to foreign markets.",0965-8564,Not found

Evidence from the US airlines,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.001,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"We examine how passengers react to carriers’ various overbooking strategies by exploiting the fact that in 2011, Delta launched a bidding system that encourages passengers on an overbooked flight to give up their reserved seats voluntarily. To examine whether Delta’s bidding system is effective in increasing (reducing) the number of passengers being voluntarily (involuntarily) bumped, we estimate the changes in the number of denied boardings for Delta and other carriers before and after Delta started its bidding system. To address endogeneity and minimize omitted variable bias, we employ two-step fixed effects Poisson regression models for estimation. The estimation results suggest that Delta’s bidding system seems to work as an effective seat inventory management technique that provides an incentive for potential holdouts to give up their reserved seats voluntarily. As a result, the bidding system is supposed to keep the number of voluntarily bumped passengers from decreasing. Delta’s bidding system seems to effectively keep the number of volunteers relatively constant and, more important, reduce the number of involuntarily bumped passengers.",0965-8564,Not found
The adoption of grid transit networks in non-metropolitan contexts,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.020,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper deals with grid transit network schemes and their specific features: orthogonal main routes that do not overlap, increased transit frequency, and distance between bus stops in interchange areas to be optimized. So far, this solution has been successfully adopted in metropolitan areas with orthogonal urban shapes (as shown by the description in Section 2). The aim of this paper is to discuss the extension of such systems into cities with less than one million inhabitants. A method to evaluate the performance of these schemes is proposed, based on the reduction of travel times for users and on the decrease of travel costs for the transport agency, with the constraint of not reducing the overall capacity. With the support of a GIS-based model, the method is applied to the case study of Turin (Italy), showing that the introduction of the grid network results in an improvement of the service, with a reduction of 16 bus routes. Compared to the current condition, this grants a reduction of both operational costs (−687€/peak hour and −232€/off-peak hour, equal to −0.7% and −0.3%) and, mostly, travel times (636 h and 316 h saved by users during peak and off-peak hours, equal to −2.4% and −2.7%), thus confirming the potential usefulness of this system in non-metropolitan contexts characterized by orthogonal schemes, and giving local transport policy-makers an additional perspective.",0965-8564,Not found

The looming challenges of regulating high level autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.007,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This article captures the implications of technology supportive of high level autonomous vehicles eclipsing the capacity of regulators to respond. To date, policy makers and industry actors have avoided confronting the impending gap, a consequence of the fact that current levels of vehicle autonomy are sufficiently low that accountability for decision-making affecting the operation of vehicles still resides with the driver. However, as automotive firms achieve higher levels of vehicle autonomy and control shifts to the vehicle itself and the infrastructure supporting it, the preponderance of responsibility will transfer to different actors: automotive firms, autonomous vehicle programmers, and policy makers. This article explains and quantifies the challenges that will arise as that process unfolds. It does this by introducing four ethics and value-based foundations that can be used to guide programming of decisions to be made by autonomous vehicles. The purpose is not to recommend a specific ethics or value-based foundation for programming high level autonomous vehicles. Rather, by programming dilemma-inducing scenarios and then directing outcomes on the basis of distinct ethical or values-based foundations, we quantifiably demonstrate that autonomous vehicle programming decisions, whether they are guided by a particular ethical foundation or moral code or not, manifest in tangibly different outcomes. Through this, we introduce and discuss challenges – many not considered previously – associated with programming and regulating high level autonomous vehicles.

Sub-optimal depot locations relative the lines run result in disadvantages in knowledge about the contract and the risk of running unpaid (or dead running) bus kilometers, leading to higher costs and/or less revenue and could affect an operator’s probability to participate in tenders. As previous studies have discussed, this is a relevant competitive factor, but the transport literature lacks studies aiming to assess the size of this distance factor. This paper examines what impact operators’ distance to tendered bus contracts has on their probability to participate in the tender, and how this probability differs across operator types. To address this, an econometric analysis was undertaken using probit regressions with data on tendered Swedish bus contracts over the period 2007–2015 along with operator workplace data. The results show that operators’ distance from a contract has a significantly negative effect on their probability of placing a bid for the contract. While being located near the contract gives, on average, an over 90 percent probability of participating, being 10 km away results in some 30 percent probability. The rival’s distance to the contract also has an effect, but only to a limited extent. Large operators are found to be less affected by their distance to a contract, and they are also more inclined to bid if the procuring authority offers a depot to use.",0965-8564,Not found
Evaluating cyclists’ perception of satisfaction using 360° videos,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.008,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"With the increase in the number of cyclists, a method to evaluate the satisfaction of cyclists has become necessary. Previous studies in Europe and America have reported several approaches to evaluate cyclists’ perception of satisfaction. This research explored an emerging technology using 360° videos to develop a method for investigating cyclists’ level of satisfaction on both sidewalks and paved shoulders in Japan. The 360° videos provide a high level of immersion compared with traditional videos. All 360° videos were filmed at sixteen different locations in Kumamoto city, Kyushu island. Participants were asked to take a video survey by viewing the 360° videos with a head-mounted display and then rating their level of satisfaction. Finally, based on the results of the video survey, both multinomial ordered logit regression model and random parameters multinomial ordered logit regression model were used to explain the relationships between cyclists’ satisfaction, traffic conditions, and road characteristics. The results show that the road characteristics variables for both sidewalks and paved shoulders have statistically significant effects on participants’ satisfaction (p < 0.05). On the other hand, traffic conditions variables did not have an impact on participants for sidewalks section. In particular, there is data available on all the variables in the model that allows planners and engineers use this method to evaluate the satisfaction of cyclists on various road segments.",0965-8564,Not found
"Who will buy alternative fueled or automated vehicles: A modular, behavioral modeling approach",10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.013,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Future car purchase can determine an array of things ranging from CO2 emissions to urban life quality. For this reason, models and methods predicting car purchase are valuable to policy makers. This paper examines the future car purchase choice, using modules and different levels of attributes that construct a car, and measures the effect on the purchase choice of personality traits such as symbolic/exuberant attitudes towards vehicles. The results may enable policy makers to focus on certain market segments when promoting alternative fuel and automated vehicles. The paper proposes a hybrid choice model, with latent variables capturing the pro-environmental, exuberant and tech-friendly attitudes of individuals. The questionnaire presented to the respondents is in the form of a menu, from which participants may choose five different types of vehicle characteristics (engine size, type of car, fuel type, car edition and level of automation) to construct their ideal vehicle. Results indicate a negative correlation between symbolic, exuberant attitudes towards automobiles, the view of cars as symbols, and willingness to purchase a hybrid or electric vehicle. The findings further suggest that there is a correlation between symbol-driven exuberant attitudes and the desire to buy a larger vehicle. This paper examines the relationship between the symbolic perception of cars and, simultaneously, a range of characteristics, to discover which car attributes the symbolic perception affects. It also proposes an integrated framework for the modeling of future car purchase, with the hypothesis that each of the three presented latent variables can affect different modules of the individual’s ideal car concept.",0965-8564,Not found
"Transport policy for liveability – Valuing the impacts on movement, place, and society",10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.009,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"In many countries, there is a movement away from ‘car-centred’ policies and a stronger interest in developing healthy, equitable, and sustainable transport systems that enhance liveability. However, the translation of these new priorities into convincing ‘economic cases’ for funding agencies requires changes in appraisal methods. This paper reviews the state of the art in the appraisal of nine impacts of transport related to liveability: trip quality, time use in transport, place quality, time use in places, personal security, visual blight, community severance, equity/social inclusion, and health/wellbeing. We look at whether and how these impacts are currently appraised in practice and propose alternative methods based on a review of the literature and our suggestions. We found that there are robust methods to measure and monetise some of the impacts, but those methods tend to be integrated in national guidelines and are not always suitable at the city or regional level. Research on stated and revealed preferences methods has moved fast but application faces issues of complexity, transferability, and double counting. It is still difficult to monetise impacts such as time use in transport and visual blight without further methodological developments.",0965-8564,Not found
The impacts of road network density on motor vehicle travel: An empirical study of Chinese cities based on network theory,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.012,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper examines the impacts of road network density on motor vehicle travel through traffic flow and network analysis of cities in China from three perspectives: multi-city comparison with traffic flow data, multi-city and multi-period comparisons with structural characteristics. When we examine the correlation between road network density and traffic flow characteristics including the travel time and speed of 35 major cities in China, no correlation exists between them which may result from different network structures, dynamic traffic demands, traffic control plans, driving behaviors, and so on. It inspires us to explore the correlation between road network density and static travel indicators. Then structural characteristic of road networks can be treated as a fixed relatively attribute and becomes the next research emphasis of this work. Comparative analysis results of three current cities (Xiamen, Washington D.C., San Jose) indicate that the average travel distance in different cities with the similar land area will not increase significantly as road network density increases. Results of an analysis of road network evolution of Changchun, China show that the increase of road network density shortens the average road segment length as well as travel distance in general. This impact on average travel distance is also related to evolution periods or modes of urban road networks. These findings provide important empirical support for planners and policymakers to understand the impacts of road network density on transport performance and design more effective urban road networks.",0965-8564,Not found
An empirical analysis of the spatial variability of fuel prices in the United States,10.1016/j.tra.2019.10.016,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"In this paper, we use a newly constructed dataset to study the geographic distribution of fuel price across the US at a very high resolution. We study the influence of socio-economic variables through different and complementary statistical methods. We highlight an optimal spatial range roughly corresponding to stationarity scale, and significant influence of variables such as median income, wage with a non-simple spatial behavior that confirms the importance of geographical particularities. On the other hand, multi-level modeling reveals a strong influence of the state in the level of price but also of some local characteristics including population density. Through the combination of such methods, we unveil the superposition of a governance process with a local socio-economical spatial process. The influence of population density on prices is furthermore consistent with a minimal theoretical model of competition between gas stations, that we introduce and solve numerically. We discuss developments and applications, including the elaboration of locally parametrized car-regulation policies.",0965-8564,Not found

The survey covers a swath of purchase intentions, general demographics, and importance of various incentives. Our results indicate that the most important incentives for plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) owners are the federal tax credit, the California state rebate, and high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane access. In addition, the importance of the incentives and their associated effect on purchase behavior has been changing over time: respondents are less likely to not change their decision and more likely to not buy a vehicle at all as time passes and the technology moves away from early adopters. Incentives are becoming more important for vehicle adopters as PEV market entry progresses.",0965-8564,Not found
Transit-oriented development: A review of research achievements and challenges,10.1016/j.tra.2019.10.018,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Among the attempts made worldwide to foster urban and transport sustainability, transit-oriented development (TOD) certainly is one of the most successful. Since the TOD concept appeared in the late 1980s, it has received increasing attention from researchers and practitioners as a way to merge together transport engineering and planning, land-use planning, and urban design for providing comprehensive solutions to contemporary urban problems. This attention has notably led to the publication of over 300 articles explicitly concerned with TOD in Web of Science journals, as well as to many implementations of the concept, some already completed and others underway (as, for example, the Grand Paris Project in France and Moscow Central Circle in Russia). Essentially, TOD can be described as land-use and transport planning that makes sustainable transport modes convenient and desirable, and that maximizes the efficiency of transport services by concentrating urban development around transit stations. However, as TOD projects started to be implemented worldwide, it became evident that their outcomes could be quite diverse, revealing that in practice the results of a project would depend on a wide variety of factors, trends and complex interrelations between them. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive, systematic and up-to-date review of TOD research achievements and challenges. We start by presenting the TOD concept, framing it in the theory of urban planning, and by describing the different typologies of TOD proposed in the literature. Then, we review the vast research dedicated to the study of TOD effects, distinguishing impacts on travel behavior, real-estate prices, residential location, urban form, and community life. The next subject we look at is TOD planning, focusing separately on policy issues and decision-support tools. In the final part of the article, based on the analysis of previous literature, we identify the main gaps and challenges that TOD research needs to address in the future.",0965-8564,Not found
The effects of transportation priority congruence for political legitimacy,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.005,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Congruence, defined as how closely the opinions of politicians match the policy preferences of voters, is a crucial aspect with respect to political legitimacy since a fundamental objective of democracy is to provide citizens with the policies they want. Yet there are not many studies that have analyzed the extent citizens and politicians are congruent when it comes to the field of transport. By studying transportation policy priorities of politicians and citizens concerning the use of (i) restrictive instruments and (ii) public transport instruments, this article contributes to the literature in at least three ways. First, the results illustrate how the priority of transportation policies varies between politicians and citizens. Politicians tend to prioritize restrictive measures more so than citizens whereas citizens tend to prioritize a reduction of public transport fares higher than politicians. Second, the article shows how the priority given transportation policy instruments is highly dependent on political ideology. Politicians representing parties to the center or left tend to prioritize the use of restrictive measures higher than politicians representing conservative parties. Third, the article explores whether there is a relationship between transportation policy congruence and political legitimacy. The article shows that lack of congruence is associated with a reduced level of trust towards local politicians and citizens being less likely to support local regime principles. These are important findings inasmuch as the literature suggests that lack of political support potentially make citizens more likely to call for radical changes, demonstrate and even abstain from the political process altogether.",0965-8564,Not found
Analysing the association of dissonance between actual and ideal commute time and commute satisfaction,10.1016/j.tra.2019.10.011,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Many studies have indicated that commute satisfaction is affected by commute time. However, the dissonance between people’s actual and ideal commute time and its effects on travel satisfaction have not been adequately explored in previous research. By using survey data from Xi’an, China, this study examines whether respondents travelling with an ideal commute time will have higher levels of travel satisfaction compared to those travelling with non-ideal commute times. Results from this study, analysing self-reported actual and ideal commute trip durations of 833 respondents, suggest that less than 20% of the participants travel with their ideal commute time and that the dissonance between actual and ideal commute time has a significant impact on travel satisfaction. Commute satisfaction is highest for respondents travelling with their ideal commuting time, followed by those whose actual commute time is shorter than ideal. Respondents whose actual commute time is longer than the ideal commute time experience the lowest levels of travel satisfaction. Moreover, commute satisfaction decreases when the inconsistency between actual and ideal commute time increases. These results suggest that the effect of commute duration on travel satisfaction might be overestimated and partly mediated by people’s preferred commute time. Finally, we also found that the dissonance between actual and ideal commute time significantly differs according to the chosen travel mode, which might partly explain differences in commute satisfaction according to the chosen mode. After controlling for commute time dissonance, the effects of commute time and travel mode on commute satisfaction are weak.",0965-8564,Not found
Does technical efficiency play a mediating role between bus facility scale and ridership attraction? Evidence from bus practices in China,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.002,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Bus ridership in many cities has not increased but, ultimately, decreased with the continuous growth of the bus facility scale in recent years in China. This study aims to explore the relationship between bus facility scale and ridership attraction by introducing technical efficiency as a mediator variable, and data collected from 152 Chinese cities in 2015 is used in the study. Technical efficiency in this paper refers to the degree to which a bus system attains its minimum inputs (labor, bus facility) with a given level of output (vehicle-km). Results show that the technical efficiency has a mediation effect. When bus facilities are few and insufficient, an increase in facilities can considerably enhance ridership attraction through higher technical efficiency, but when the scale of bus facilities increases to an excess, ridership attraction suffers from the negative impact of a lower technical efficiency. This study offers a theoretical explanation and provides decision support for policy-makers who would like to strengthen bus ridership attraction.",0965-8564,Not found
Network-level energy consumption estimation for electric vehicles considering vehicle and user heterogeneity,10.1016/j.tra.2019.10.010,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"As a green transport means, electric vehicle (EV) has received widespread attention in recent years and an increasing number of cities have been establishing their EV transport systems including EV fleet management and charging infrastructure. Transport policy-makers are concerning about the system performance of an EV charging system measured by energy consumption and user experience. We in this paper aim to develop an effective method for the expected total energy consumption estimation (ETEC) of EV charging systems deployed in a dense city. To achieve this objective, we firstly introduce the nonlinear charging profile, its impacts on energy consumption as well as user experience, and present an approach for estimating the nonlinear charging time. We then elaborate our method to estimate energy consumption for one-time EV charging by addressing four kinds of energy losses in charging process. Next, charging frequency by considering multi-type EVs, and their heterogeneities and different charging needs for normal and fast charging systems is analyzed in depth. These two together determine the network-wide energy consumption and a pro-rated approach is used to figure out the spatial distribution of energy consumption. A case study of Singapore is conducted in the end to validate the proposed methodology. Numerical results reveal a trade-off between energy saving and user experience, and also demonstrate the importance of considering heterogeneities of driving range, charging preference and daily travel mileage.",0965-8564,Not found
Do changes in travellers’ attitudes towards car use and ownership over time affect travel mode choice? A latent transition approach in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.tra.2019.10.015,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper examines how changes in travellers’ attitudes towards car use and ownership change over time and how these changes influence car use, based on the 2014 and 2016 waves of the Netherlands Mobility Panel (N = 1640). A latent transition model was estimated to investigate transitions between different segments based on travellers’ attitudes towards car use and ownership, and the latent transition probabilities were used to predict changes in mode use. Four latent classes were found to reflect the participants’ attitudes: cost-sensitive, car-minded, environmentally aware and social-conscious travellers. Most of the participants remained in the same class between 2014 and 2016, which suggests that attitudes towards car use and ownership are stable over time. Also, the results indicate that car use and car ownership may be less widespread among younger adults. Only when younger adults face life events, such as moving, starting a job or become parents, transitioning to more car-oriented profiles appears more likely. Changes in attitudes towards car use and car ownership do not significantly affect car use (number of trips per day), except for the social-conscious travellers who switched to the car-minded class. This suggests that, in most cases, a more positive or negative attitude towards car use and ownership does not directly affect the frequency of car use.",0965-8564,Not found
Does conducting activities while traveling reduce the value of time? Evidence from a within-subjects choice experiment,10.1016/j.tra.2019.10.017,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Many studies about conducting activities while traveling start from the hypothesis that conducting onboard activities reduces the value of time (VoT). However, surprisingly limited empirical evidence is provided for this hypothesis. The few studies that aim at providing this evidence face methodological problems in the sense that effects attributed to conducting onboard activities are confounded with differences between groups. This paper further develops and applies a solution for this problem proposed by Wardman and Lyons (2016). In essence, this method includes constructing a within-person choice experiment, which involves that the same respondents make choices in a context that enables conducting activities, as well as in a context that does not enable conducting activities. This method is applied in a study that collected data from 820 train travelers in the Netherlands. The results show that as expected, the VoT in the activity context is significantly lower than the VoT in the non-activity context, which thus supports the hypothesis. Reduction in VoT due to conducting onboard activities is around 30% for commuters, while leisure travelers who prefer to read lose almost half their VoT value. In addition, this paper discusses how the estimated VoT reduction values can be interpreted as the Value of Activity (VoA), which can be used for appraising investments aimed at reducing the disutility of travel other than by means of reducing travel time, such as improving Internet connections.",0965-8564,Not found
Can a strategy of integrated air-bus services create a value proposition for regional aviation management?,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.013,132,2020-02-01,2020,2,"While there is a well-developed body of academic literature on how to procure public ground transport services and how to integrate those services, there is virtually no literature on how to do this in the context of regional air services. This paper aims to contribute to the area of strategic management of integrated transport based on the concept of mobility as a service. We show that customer-centric public transport integration (e.g. joint ticketing) with aviation as the highest priority can create business opportunities and competitive advantage for the ‘air-bus’ transport value chain. In the regional aviation context in particular, the door-to-door travel experience is of high importance given the potential competition from private car travel, except for island air services. Based on demand analysis and travel choice literature, we reveal that integrated planning and management efforts such as joint timetabling and joint pricing are most likely to have an impact on competitive advantage, demand (passenger numbers plus yields, measured in the customers’ willingness to pay) and hence the attractiveness and profitability of regional air services. We use stated choice experiments for flights from Sydney to regional New South Wales (NSW), Australia to establish the willingness to pay for integrated ground transport add-ons to scheduled regional air services.",0965-8564,Not found

Older adults living in both urban and peripheral areas may benefit from the availability of new automated modes due to increasing levels of accessibility.

Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to explore the mobility needs and desires of older adults in the province of Utrecht, the Netherlands, and assess how they envision the future usage of four distinct AV scenarios: automated public transport with fixed schedules, routes and timetables; automated on-demand public transport; fleet-based shared automated vehicles; and privately owned automated vehicles. Based on the results of a series of focus groups, findings demonstrate that study participants have a strong interest in using AVs in their daily life to overcome current accessibility and mobility barriers. Increases in flexibility due to on-demand booking, using the mode for access and egress to other modes of transport, as well as the option to travel together with friends were found to be important factors in having a positive attitude towards AV adoption.

Both the BSS operators and the customers can benefit from the large digital data portals that continuously record the state of the BSS. In this context, the current study developed generalized extreme value (GEV) count models that can predict hourly bike arrivals and departures at each station while accounting for time-of-day, weather, built environment, infrastructure, temporal, and spatial dependency factors. The proposed models were used to analyze the demand patterns in the Capital Bikeshare system and were found to predict the demand at both aggregate and disaggregate levels with reasonable accuracy. Specifically, the total demand in the entire system was predicted within 5% margin of error whereas 75% of the station-level arrival and departure predictions in the next one hour were within a margin of one from the observed counts. The proposed modeling system is useful (a) to BSS customers to better plan their travel based on expected bike and dock availability at the origin and destination ends of their BSS trips, and (b) to BSS operators to anticipate the future demand and optimize their rebalancing plans.",0965-8564,Not found

In the developed model, work/school, and night sleep are assumed to be pre-determined, thereby providing a daily “skeleton schedule”. NWS episodes are then simultaneously generated and scheduled in the available gaps as a joint activity type and destination choice, followed by a continuous time expenditure choice. The model is built on a subset of the Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) collected in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) in 2001. The developed model is validated on another sample from the TTS 2001 and is also applied to forecast individuals’ schedules for the years 2006 and 2011, for which observed TTS data are also available. This study, which is rarely conducted in the literature, examines the model’s capability to replicate the base year schedule and predict the activity patterns of the future years, which is the ultimate purpose of any travel demand model.

The role of information availability to passengers in public transport disruptions: An agent-based simulation approach,10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.007,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"In public transport disruptions, a key relation between the services of operating company and passengers’ satisfaction is the disseminated information. This paper proposes rigorous mathematical descriptions to describe the effects of information availability to passengers, including the user equilibrium and non-equilibrium solutions. The information availability in disruption is summarised in a “who-when-where-what” four-dimensional framework. Based on different information, passengers’ behaviours are assumed and simulated to evaluate the benefits of information availability in public transport disruption. An agent-based micro-simulation model (MATSim) is applied for the city of Zürich, Switzerland, for the benefit of activity-based simulation in a multi-modal network. We use an existing day-to-day replanning method, and extend the study with a within-day replanning approach in MATSim, to study agents’ route choices responding to public transport disruption in one single iteration. The disruption is assumed as a rail track blockage between Zürich HB and Zürich Oerlikon via both Zürich Wipkingen and Zürich Hardbrücke. One benchmark of agents’ behaviours without disruption and other three scenarios based on different information are simulated. Statistic results are analysed for all the agents who may be involved in the defined disruption. Agents’ flow in related transit routes and transport modes shows their adaptations to the corresponding information availability. Agents’ delays and scores reveal that information significantly impacts agents’ satisfaction in public transport disruption.",0965-8564,Not found

We estimate an integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model using a stated preference survey for morning car commuters in the Greater Copenhagen Area. We interact the rescheduling components in the Scheduling Model (SM) with the latent variable Inertia. The modelling results show that higher levels of inertia yields higher rescheduling penalties and lower willing to shift departure time. Furthermore, we find that inertia in departure time is influenced by gender, presence of children in the household as well as work type. We test the behavioral responses to demand management policies for segments with different inertia, and find that the least inertial segment showed the highest substitution patterns, while the most inertial segment show the lowest substitution patterns. Finally, we compared the ICLV model to a reference model without inertia, and find that the effects of the demand management strategy is overestimated if inertia is neglected.",0965-8564,Not found

In response to this concern, we investigate spatial dependence of job opportunities among 30 Chinese provincial capital cities (PCCs) from 2002 to 2016, giving special attention to the spatial spillovers of the opening of the high-speed rail (HSR). Using appropriate spatial panel data models, our findings suggest the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation of job opportunities among PCCs. Whilst the HSR has been found to increase job opportunities at the national level, which, however, is not confirmed at the regional level. The spatial spillover effects of the HSR are significant and positive only in the eastern/northeastern region. These findings can help the central government to more fully understand spatial dependence of job opportunities, better plan future HSR networks, and efficiently allocate transportation resources, encouraging cross-regional collaboration to promote regional employment.",0965-8564,Not found
A multicriteria decision making approach to study barriers to the adoption of autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.013,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Automation technology is emerging, but the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles (AV) will depend upon how policymakers and the government address various challenges such as public acceptance and infrastructure development. This study follows a five-stage method to understand these barriers to AV adoption. First, based on a literature review followed by discussions with experts, ten barriers are identified. Second, the opinions of eighteen experts from industry and academia regarding inter-relations between these barriers are recorded. Third, a multicriteria decision making technique, the grey-based Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Grey-DEMATEL), is applied to characterize the structure of relationships between the barriers. Fourth, robustness of the results is tested using sensitivity analysis. Fifth, the key results are depicted in a causal loop diagram (CLD), a systems thinking approach, to comprehend cause-and-effect relationships between the barriers. The results indicate that the lack of customer acceptance (LCA) is the most prominent barrier, the one which should be addressed at the highest priority. The CLD suggests that LCA can be mitigated by addressing two other prominent and more tangible barriers – lack of industry standards and the absence of regulations and certifications. The study’s contribution lies in demonstrating that the barriers to AV adoption do not exist in isolation but are linked with each other in overlapping loops of cause and effect relationships. These insights can help different stakeholders in prioritizing their endeavors to expedite AV adoption. From the methodological perspective, this is the first study in the transportation literature that integrates Grey-DEMATEL with systems thinking.",0965-8564,Not found
Characterizing urban last-mile distribution strategies in mature and emerging e-commerce markets,10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.003,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,E-retailers and other companies participating in the e-commerce supply chain are developing a variety of strategies for last-mile e-commerce distribution in urban areas. These strategies must account for a number of elements of local context which can be particularly challenging in emerging markets. Urban last-mile distribution strategies that are specifically tailored to these markets are rarely discussed in the extant literature. This study uses a combination of literature review and case study analysis to establish an integrated conceptual framework that allows to characterize urban last-mile e-commerce distribution strategies in both mature and emerging markets. We then use this structured framework to perform a review and comparison of different last-mile distribution strategies and highlight variables impacting the choice of network design decisions.,0965-8564,Not found
Can providing safe cycling infrastructure encourage people to cycle more when it rains? The use of crowdsourced cycling data (Strava),10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.008,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Many local authorities in the UK and other developed countries have spent a substantial amount of time and money providing safe cycling infrastructure to improve cycling environments. However, it is not clear whether these expensive physical investments are an effective strategy to encourage people to cycle more in cities where there is a high level of precipitation. The evidence is limited, partly due to data limitations. We used crowdsourced cycling data (taken from the Strava activity-tracking app) and fixed-effects panel regression models to investigate whether providing safe cycling infrastructure could be an effective way to overcome adverse weather conditions. We selected the city centre of Glasgow, Scotland because of the current size and scope of investments. We found that providing safe cycle paths could encourage people to cycle more, especially on dry days. However, findings suggested that rainy cities like Glasgow may not have realised the full benefits of safe cycling infrastructure because there are larger reductions in the volume of cycling on rainy days on these routes. Planners, especially from cities with a high level of precipitation, should consider how to improve cycle paths to overcome adverse weather and other policies (e.g., providing shower facilities at workplaces, incentives to cycle, etc.) to increase cyclists’ resilience to bad weather.",0965-8564,Not found
Spatial panel model for examining airport relationships within multi-airport regions,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.011,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"For better airport planning and air traffic management, local airport authority in a multi-airport region (MAR) often needs to consider the impacts of competition and collaboration with nearby airports on its own airport traffic. This paper proposed a dynamic spatial panel regression model to test the regional effects on airports in a MAR. The proposed model is applied to four closely situated airports in the Pearl River Delta region (PRD), China, to analyze their interactions, identify the determining factors, and evaluate the impact of these factors on airport capacity. PRD is one of the most prosperous areas in Asia, and competition among the four airports has intensified, due, in part, to the rapid growth of Guangzhou airport and Shenzhen airport. Together with the fact that Hong Kong airport reached 98% of its runway capacity in 2016, it is of great interest to understand the interactions among the airports in this region. The findings show that airport degree, flight frequency, airport capacity utilization, income, population, GDP, and fuel price are significant factors affecting airport’s capacity. Furthermore, there is a spatially lagged effect in income and population, and a time-lagged effect in airport capacity, GDP, and fuel price.",0965-8564,Not found
Empty container repositioning with foldable containers in a river transport network considering the limitations of bridge heights,10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.019,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"River–sea intermodal transport is becoming increasingly popular for container repositioning in hinterland areas, owing to its cost-efficiency and low energy consumption. However, bridge heights and water depths may restrict the sailing of container vessels on rivers, which presents a challenge for the wider implementation of river–sea intermodal transport. In this study, we investigate the potential of foldable containers to improve empty container repositioning in river–sea intermodal transport, with consideration of bridge height and water depth constraints. A mathematical model is developed to minimize the total cost. Numerical experiments based on near-practical instances on the Yangtze River in China are conducted to test the effectiveness of the model and the efficiency of foldable containers. The results show that introducing foldable containers into empty container repositioning along a river can utilize vessel space more effectively and decrease the total cost for container shipping companies. The joint impacts of bridge heights and foldable containers on the overall performance are analyzed to obtain managerial insights. Finally, policies are suggested to facilitate the implementation of foldable containers for river–sea intermodal transport.",0965-8564,Not found
Visual representation in urban transport planning: Where have all the cars gone?,10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.027,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"To strengthen public participation in planning and to aid the public in understanding the proposed plans, planners use different types of illustrations to show the outcome of a project. Effective presentation of the projects’ impacts on the public has become increasingly essential in planning and designing transport systems. However, a central premise for conscious decision-making is that the information of the project must be realistically presented so that the plans are accurate in relation to the estimated effects. Drawing from theories on visualisation in plans and science and technology studies (STS), the paper aims to discuss and raise awareness of visual representation in urban transport planning. Using data from large road infrastructure projects in Norway, visual illustrations found in planning documents are analysed in relation to written texts on traffic effects and the overall project goal. By focusing on the visual illustrations, it is shown that artefacts related to the green environment and transport modes of cycles, buses and walking are overrepresented in the documents. The visualisation support the idea of a sustainable transport system and a sustainable mobility planning approach. Most of the projects are road enlargement projects; however, there is a lack of visualisation of car flows, or the flows are very low. Cars are toned down (or even absent) compared with the estimated effects. The documents also show clear patterns of standardisation of artefacts. Nevertheless, there is a heterogeneity in the visual illustrations when combining different documents. The paper introduces the concept ‘add-on flexibility’ to illustrate this type of contextualisation. It contributes to a new critical perspective on visualisation and its representation in urban transport planning.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of institutional conditions on willingness to take contractual risk in port public-private partnerships of developing countries,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.023,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Public–private partnerships (PPPs) are gaining popularity in port development projects especially in developing countries. A key question emerges that why private companies are willing to take more risk in some port PPP projects but not in others. This paper empirically investigates willingness to take port PPP contractual risk from institutional perspectives. Specifically, the paper examines impacts of business friendliness, political effectiveness, and freedom from governmental intervention on private investors’ willingness to take port PPP contractual risk. The analysis covers a total of 398 port PPP projects in developing countries from 1995 to 2016 based on the World Bank Private Participation in Infrastructure database. Findings reveal that the effect of political effectiveness on willingness to take contractual risk mediates through two variables (1) business friendliness and (2) freedom from governmental intervention, where the former mediation contributes positively, and the latter has a negative impact. The research is the first attempt in the literature that examines differences in the willingness to take PPP contractual risk among private investors.

Port Community Systems: A structured literature review,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.021,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Port Community Systems (PCS) are inter-organizational software platforms that connects port community actors, enabling commercial services and information exchange between the port to their customers and a variety of stakeholders. Our main motivation for this paper lies in the absence of surveys on the PCS literature, hence the purpose of this paper is to perform a structured literature review on PCS to establish promising research gaps. Such review was conducted surveying the literature about PCS from 2001 until 2019. The study introduces a detailed and current worldwide PCS inventory using a proposed evolution framework and a taxonomy, the latter built upon commonly cited factors from the IT systems development literature in the context of port communities, which are synthesized into three frames: a Business frame, an Integration frame, and a Legal frame. Findings show that literature on PCS is scarce and fragmented, oftentimes with PCS research published in non-specialized documents on the topic, with few comparative studies between countries and several countries receiving little attention. Few authors have high specialization on the topic while most authors in average contribute less than once to the body of knowledge. Additionally, it was found that industry is ahead of scientific research in terms of documenting PCS development and technical features. The results also show a lack of innovation regarding PCS research studies, which risks relegating PCS research to irrelevance. A major critique to extant PCS literature is about its inertia, as research tends to be excessively comfortable with the legacy PCS, neglecting its need to evolve and adapt to new markets (in response to the growth of emerging economies) or to extended functionalities (taking advantage of the surge of new technologies). Furthermore, it was found that the future of PCS research should aim for addressing practical needs, while fostering collaboration among practitioners and scholars.",0965-8564,Not found
Evaluating the implementation of performance-based fuel uplift regulation for airline operation,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.028,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"While fuel regulations traditionally rely on a prescriptive safety margin approach that includes a significant buffer for fuel loadings, the current enhancements in computational power and understanding of in-flight uncertainties allow for the implementation of a performance-based approach. A performance-based approach is a risk-assessed fuel uplift decision dependent on historical performance and is becoming increasingly plausible and recommended by modern civil aviation authorities. This paper investigates the evolution of fuel planning policies and explores the potential integration of current research pertaining to performance-based fuel policy-making. We consolidate the developments of three research areas - fuel consumption estimation, in-flight uncertainty quantification and decision analysis, and provide insight for regulators and airline operators in identifying potential transformation towards more efficient operations. Three future research directions in (1) risk assessment on fuel uplift decision, (2) uncertainty quantification and propagation and (3) policy assessment and evaluation, are suggested to assist policy-makers in efficiently implementing a performance-based fuel policy.",0965-8564,Not found

With the technology advances in battery electric vehicles, owing to their zero emissions, an increasing number of carsharing companies are replacing their fleets with battery electric vehicles. This paper provides insights into the mode choice mechanism of travelers when battery electric vehicle sharing is incorporated in an urban transport system. A nested logit model is developed to jointly analyze the mode choice and route-vehicle choice under various trip scenarios. The impacts of the level-of-service variables including the access distance and remaining range are investigated. The results show that battery electric vehicle sharing can serve as a substitute for taxis in long-distance trips. Further, the access distance to a shared battery electric vehicle has a more significant impact on the mode choice of a traveler, which is 1.78 times that of the impact of the egress distance in the utility function. It is also found that when the trip distance increases, a traveler tends to become more tolerant to the access distance and requires a longer remaining range of vehicles.",0965-8564,Not found

A new perspective on the role of attitudes in explaining travel behavior: A psychological network model,10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.014,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Psychological factors are generally thought to play an important role in the prediction of individual variations in travel behavior and travel related choices. To assess their effects in statistical models, three assumptions are typically made, namely: (1) the psychological factors influence behavior/choices and not vice versa, (2) psychological factors can be conceptualized as latent variables measured by observed indicators and (3) estimated between-person relationships are indicative of within-person relationships. Recent research has shown that each of these assumptions is conceptually and empirically problematic. This paper introduces to the field of travel behavior research an alternative modeling approach which has its roots in the emerging field of Network Psychometrics. This so-called psychological network model avoids the above mentioned problematic assumptions, by modeling the relationships between attitudinal and behavioral indicators as dynamic causal systems which can be operationalized as a network. We illustrate the new insights that may be gained from this approach in a travel behavior context. In particular, we estimate between-person and within-person network models using data from a (two-wave) panel survey containing indicators regarding travel modality use and related attitudes. Our results indicate that the extent to which the use of a mode is considered convenient is most strongly connected to the actual use of the corresponding mode, and that the convenience of using the car takes a central position in the attitude-behavior network. At the within-person level, no strong connections between attitudes and behaviors seem to exist. This latter finding serves as a warning against the practice, embodied in many popular travel behavior models, of interpreting associations between attitudes and (travel) behaviors as causal within-person relations.",0965-8564,Not found

Competition between high-speed trains and air travel in China: From a spatial to spatiotemporal perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.030,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Scheduling strategies are important to improve network efficiency and optimize time slots for both high-speed train (HST) and air travel. Although many scholars have studied HST and air travel competition from the perspectives of the spatial patterns and travel costs of the two transportation modes, few studies have investigated their potential temporal competition. To fill this research gap, this paper uses a time window method to examine the relationship between HSTs and flights operating between city-pairs. From the perspective of departure time, an analysis was conducted in the overlapping network of HSTs and flights at the city-pair level in China, based on one-day schedules. The results show that (1) HSTs and flights were temporally scheduled differently according to their within-day dynamics, and (2) HSTs and flights experienced fierce competition from 7 am to 9 am on average. Furthermore, the proposed classification method identifies city-pairs in a single-mode dominant market, full competition market, partial competition market, and complementary coordination market. Spatially, 24 city-pairs operating 343 flights with 533 train competitors in one day formed the full competition market with high-frequency schedules, including such city-pairs as Beijing-Shanghai, Guangzhou-Shanghai, and Shanghai-Xi’an. The method to classify city-pairs according to the similarity and diversity of HST and flight schedules may be generalized for allocating time slots for two modes. This work may help to schedule HSTs and flights in future transportation management.",0965-8564,Not found

Learning from the grassroots: A resourcefulness-based worldview for transport planning,10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.001,133,2020-03-01,2020,3,"For decades sustainability has been proposed as a framework for a necessary paradigm shift in transport planning. However, critical scholars have shown how this concept, presented with a strong emphasis on economic growth, has limited capacity to truly challenge the current transport-related environmental and social crises or to constitute an ecological worldview. This paper explores resourcefulness as a complementary concept to inform transport planning and practice. A resourcefulness-based worldview, informed by critical theory and challenging the current distribution of material, intellectual and civic resources, aims to constitute a political shift towards guaranteeing the conditions for challenging crises and for just deliberations concerning ecological futures. The idea of resourcefulness is not proposed as a blueprint for transport planning, nor as a top-down theoretical framework. Rather, with a research approach inspired by Participatory Action Research, it is explored in dialogue with the practices of two grassroots movements: the Urban Mobility Forum and the Move Your City project. These movements have been proposing alternative transport planning views and practices in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and L’Aquila (Italy).",0965-8564,Not found
Vélomobilities of care in a low-cycling city,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.014,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Mobilities of care, the travel required to meet one and others’ household needs such as shopping, running errands, or escorting children, are often understood as difficult to complete by bicycle because they tend to involve transporting goods or people. Because women tend to complete more unpaid household labour than men, the bicycle’s assumed incompatibility with household-serving travel has been suggested as a possible explanation for the gender-gap in cycling within low-cycling cities. However, the ways in which people use the bicycle to complete this form of travel in low-cycling cities has yet to be studied. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with residents of Toronto, Canada, who are new to cycling, this paper addresses this knowledge gap by providing a detailed account of how cyclists use their bicycles to complete mobilities of care. Results indicate that traveling with children and grocery shopping in bulk is generally considered difficult by bicycle. Buying small amounts of groceries and trip-chaining, however, was usually perceived as convenient. This paper also frames participants’ experiences completing this gendered travel by bicycle using social practice theory to demonstrate how even difficult household serving trips are possible by bicycle when people are equipped with certain meanings, competencies, and materials. This paper contributes to the cycling literature by demonstrating the ways in which people use bicycles to complete gendered mobilities of care in a low-cycling city. By highlighting the challenges people face, as well as they ways in which some people overcome these challenges, it also points to possible policy interventions that could encourage city cycling.",0965-8564,Not found

This study collects cross-country panel data from 2007 to 2016 and investigates the impact of transport infrastructure (railway and road) on the economic growth in the BRI countries. First, a spatial-temporal characteristics analysis of transport infrastructure and economic growth is presented. Then, the global Moran’s I and the local Moran scatterplot are employed to test for possible spatial autocorrelations. Finally, both static and dynamic spatial models are utilized to empirically examine the impact of transport infrastructure on economic growth from the national and regional perspectives. The estimation results at the national level reveal that the transport infrastructure in the BRI countries plays an essential role in facilitating economic growth. Moreover, this study finds significantly positive spatial spillover effects of economic growth in the categories of geographical distance, economic distance, cultural distance, and institutional distance spatial weight matrices, i.e., shorter geographical distances and economic, cultural and institutional similarities among the BRI countries lead to mutual economic growth. The estimation results at the regional level indicate that the spatial spillover effects of transport infrastructure are significantly negative in East Asia-Central Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States and in South Asia. On the contrary, the positive spatial spillover effect of transport infrastructure on economic growth is most pronounced in Central and Eastern Europe. This indicates the polarization effect in the initial stage of the lagging transport infrastructure and the diffusion effects after the transport infrastructure is mature. This study is valuable because it examines the impact of transport infrastructure on economic growth in the BRI countries. In addition, two policy suggestions for driving the regional economy in the BRI countries are given.",0965-8564,Not found
A comprehensive approach for the appraisal of the barrier effect of roads on pedestrians,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.003,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Roads can become physical and/or psychological barriers to the movement of pedestrians, an impact known as the “barrier effect” or “community severance”. This paper proposes a new approach for measuring and valuing the barrier effect of different types of roads and for integrating the values into the appraisal of transport projects. This approach was developed based on the results of a survey of residents in areas around busy roads in two English cities. A series of stated preference exercises elicited preferences regarding crossing roads with specified design and traffic characteristics in locations with or without designated crossing facilities and making trade-offs with walking time and benefits or costs. The exercises were customised to represent different trip purposes (work, shopping, or leisure). Results were scaled with those obtained from a revealed preference exercise among some of the same participants, who indicated on a map their usual walking routes to locations that required them to cross the road. The results of the models of the participants' choices were then used to develop an index of the size of the barrier effect caused by the different characteristics of roads (number of lanes, presence/width of central reservation (median strip), traffic density, and traffic speed) and pedestrian crossing facilities (type, waiting time, and walking time to access them). The index was also related with the estimated willingness to pay to reduce the barrier effect for existing trips, and with the number of new walking trips that could be generated with that reduction.",0965-8564,Not found

Hitherto, few studies have analyzed dockless micromobility, and scooter-share particularly using big data. This paper analyzes and compares the determinants of dockless scooters-share (DSS) and of station-based bike-share (SBBS) rides in D.C. It made use of API data from dockless vendors and historical trip data from Capital Bikeshare from December 2018 to June 2019. Two variables were estimated: hourly number of trips and hourly median duration of trips. A negative-binomial regression model was performed at the hourly scale controlling for environmental and economic variables including weather-related data, gasoline prices, local events or disturbances, day of week, and time of day. Four groups were analyzed: all of micromobility combined and weighed, SBBS members, SBBS non-members, and DSS. Three important findings emerged: (1) Temporal use differences between the three user groups were found, but DSS users behave most similarly to SBBS non-members. (2) Weather is less of a disutility for DSS users than for SBBS users. We attribute this to the physical ease of using a scooter and to the convenience of ending a trip at the actual destination rather than a nearby docking station. (3) All micromobility user types are sensitive to changing gas prices, although DSS users appear slightly more sensitive both in terms of trip count and duration. Additionally, an analysis of the interaction between modes found a possible competition between DSS and SBBS non-members and a complementary relationship between DSS and SBBS members. We conclude that significant differences exist between the two modes, and combined with its sudden and rising popularity, micromobility and DSS in particular could have a major role in promoting a shift towards low-carbon mobility.",0965-8564,Not found

Transport policymakers may pose a question of whether this new way of thinking has an effect on mode choice. However, a clear answer to this question has not been found. Similarly, the intuitive expectation that physical activity can be a motivation for the selection of more physically active travel modes has not been well documented. This study attempts to investigate the potential influences of the ecological view on environmentalism and attitude towards physical activity on mode choice. The analytic data comes from a sample of 821 respondents with 1840 reported trips in an online survey conducted in Nagoya, Japan in 2018. The postulated effects were investigated in the framework of an integrated choice and latent variable model and a latent class choice model. The estimates from our models showed that environmentalism had a positive effect on the share of rail though its effect on class assignment, and attitude towards physical activity had a positive effect on both utilities and shares of bicycling and walking.

Confronting congestion in urban areas: Developing Sustainable Mobility Plans for public and private organizations in Bogotá,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.019,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Work trips contribute the most to congestion during peak hours in urban areas. For that reason, public and private organizations can play a relevant part by developing mobility plans (MPs) to propose possible strategies to confronting congestion. Although MP strategies such as the promotion of active and public transport modes, the implementation of parking policies, telecommuting, and flexible work schedules have gained popularity for addressing traffic congestion in recent years, there has been a lack of studies reporting on the potential impact of their implementation in organizations located in Global South cities. This paper evaluates the modal choice by drivers (cars and motorcycles) in response to a series of specific mobility strategies if MPs are implemented by mid-size and large public and private organizations in the city of Bogotá (Colombia). The modal share of employee trips after implementing different travel demand management instruments was evaluated using a stated preference survey. The results of this study suggest that substantial increases of parking charges in the organization’s vicinity are likely to lead to the highest reduction of private cars use and the highest modal share increase for public transport, carpooling, bicycling, and walking. The provision of company bus services seems not to be as the most effective strategy to discourage employees from using a car. Then, these plans should contain a combination of strategies rather than consider them separately to increase the possibility of achieving better results. Also, more studies evaluating the potential success of organizations adopting MPs in the cities of the Global South are needed.",0965-8564,Not found

Counterfactual analysis is conducted based on the service model estimation and matching results. Our investigation suggests that although the Central Asia–China markets are characterized by poor connectivity and high airfares, more liberal aviation policies such as those proposed by the Belt and Road initiative are likely to help overcome the existing high service barriers. In particular, our counterfactual analysis suggests that if the Central Asia–China markets were regulated and operated in a similar way to the routes between Central Asia and other states, the probability of having aviation services between cities in China and Central Asia would increase substantially, with more direct flights to a larger number of Chinese cities such as Xiamen, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Chengdu, Kunming etc. We recommend further liberalizations between Central Asia and the region’s major trade partners.",0965-8564,Not found
Incorporating the impacts of climate change in transportation infrastructure decision models,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.013,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Historically an important transportation corridor in the Northwest Territories, climate change has shortened the duration of the Mackenzie River’s navigational season. Communities rely increasingly on airlift as the growing volatility affects barging operations, leading to higher overall freight costs. Using an options approach, we present a methodological framework that supports flexible infrastructure decision making, accounting for the impacts of climate change uncertainty. We apply this method to the decision of whether to continue barging on the Mackenzie River, or connect the entire corridor by extending the all-weather Mackenzie Valley Highway, explicitly considering uncertainties in river barging conditions. We first model river open season days as a stochastic process; barging is dependent on the number of open season days, which in turn is affected by climate change. Second, we evaluate the expected cost of barging and airlift each season using a modified Black-Scholes model. Finally, we use real options to determine how long construction of the all-weather highway may be deferred. The results indicate that it is advisable to defer construction nearly a decade, in balancing the costs of construction against climate change uncertainty. This paper demonstrates that when we explicitly incorporate the impact of climate change on project valuations, particularly those in northern and Arctic Canada where these impacts are considerable, project valuations can change significantly such that all-weather road construction is supported, even if it is deferred to future years. This method can assist federal and territorial governments in communicating the impacts of climate change on communities, and provide another tool to support multi-layered, complex transportation infrastructure investment decisions that address these rapidly changing environments.",0965-8564,Not found
Operational benefits and challenges of shared-ride automated mobility-on-demand services,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.017,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the operations of shared-ride automated mobility-on-demand services (SRAMODS). The study identifies (i) operational benefits of SRAMODS including improved service quality and/or lower operational costs relative to automated mobility-on-demand services (AMODS) without shared rides; and (ii) challenges associated with operating SRAMODS. The study employs an agent-based stochastic dynamic simulation framework to model the operational problems of AMODS. The agents include automated vehicles (AVs), on-demand user requests, and a central AV fleet controller that can dynamically change the plans (i.e. routes and AV-user assignments) of AVs in real-time using optimization-based control policies. The agent-based simulation tool and AV fleet control policies are used to test the operational performance of AMODS under a variety of scenarios. The first set of scenarios vary user demand and a parameter constraining the maximum user detour distance. Results indicate that even with a small maximum user detour distance parameter value, allowing shared rides significantly improves the operational efficiency of the AV fleet, where the efficiency gains stem from economies of demand density and network effects. The second set of scenarios vary the mean and coefficient of variation of the curbside pickup time parameter; i.e. how long an AV must wait curbside at a user’s pickup location before the user gets inside the AV. Results indicate that increases in mean curbside pickup time significantly degrade operational performance in terms of user in-vehicle travel time and user wait time. The study quantifies the total system (user plus fleet controller) cost as a function of mean curbside pickup time. Finally, the paper provides an extensive discussion of the implications of the quantitative analysis for public-sector transportation planners and policy-makers as well as for mobility service providers.",0965-8564,Not found
Development of a large-scale transport model with focus on cycling,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.010,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This study presents a transport model to better model cycling demand. The model improves modelling of cycling in several ways compared to a conventional transport model. First, it uses a detailed bicycle network containing information about existing bicycle infrastructure. Second, generalised cost measures based on different bicycle route choice models are calculated and compared to evaluate how to best represent the impact of bicycle infrastructure in the model. Third, the model utilizes a refined zone system with smaller zones of size 250 m × 250 m. Using these smaller zones, more short-distance tours are included in the model, and these are predominantly walking and cycling trips. Fourth, the model considers cycling also as an access mode choice to public transport. Therefore, the model treats cycling and public transport as both competing and complementary modes. Results show that the model captures detailed individual heterogeneity in cycling demand for different trip purposes. Impacts of bicycle infrastructure, land use characteristics and individual/household socio-demographics are investigated. Detailed individual level travel time and generalised cost are derived for cyclists of different socio-demographics. The result highlights the importance of choosing a good measure of generalised cost, given that different bicycle route choice models result in different effects of bicycle infrastructure. In future applications, the model can be used to evaluate proposed bicycle investments regarding their impact on link flow, bicycle route choice, modal shift and generation of completely new tours. The model can also be a powerful tool in a cost-benefit analysis of bicycle investments.",0965-8564,Not found
Understanding relative commuting within dual-earner couples in Germany,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.006,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Women’s entrenched workforce participation has contributed to the rise in dual-earner households over the last two decades in Germany. In transport research, dual-earner households are gaining more importance over time, as intra-couple interactions play a significant role in housing, mobility and travel behaviour. Various studies on gender differences in commuting claim that women commute shorter distances than men due to their secondary labour status within the family. However, this gender gap in commuting behaviour has steadily declined over recent decades. Nevertheless, the intra-household factors causing the gender gap in commute distance between partners are not yet fully understood. The study examines the association between intra-household arrangements (economic power, car access, labour and domestic work-sharing and preferences on work-sharing) within dual-earner couples and the gender gap in their commute distances (called relative commuting here). We used the German National Time Use Survey and employed regression analysis. Four general findings of the study are: (a) male partners commute longer than female partners, (b) gender differences in economic prospects increase the gender gap; (c) a relative dominance of car access by the female partner reduces the gender gap in commute distances, and (d) an increase in time spent on unpaid work by the male partner decreases the gender gap.",0965-8564,Not found
Spatial risk modelling of behavioural hotspots: Risk-aware path planning for autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.024,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to considerably improve road safety. That said, accident risk will continue to inflict societal costs. The ability to manage and measure these risks is fundamental to ensure societal acceptance and public adoption of AVs. In particular, the ability to quantitatively compare the safety of AVs relative to human drivers is crucial. Managing risk exposures through driving operational design domains (ODD) will also become prevalent. Ultimately, the deployment of AVs will hinge on the premise that they are safer than humans. In this paper, we posit a methodology to quantitatively evaluate AV risks and minimise their risk exposure once they are publically available. Two contributions are offered. First, we provide a proactive means of evaluating AV risks based on driving behaviour and safety-critical events. This offers statistically meaningful comparisons between humans and AVs given the limitation of current historical data. Second, we propose a novel risk-aware path planning methodology for AVs based on telematics behavioural data. Driving data from a cohort of young human drivers over roughly 270,000 km in Ireland is used to demonstrate the posited methodology. An unsupervised geostatistical tool called Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is used to identify “behavioural hotspots” and the risk exposure at each edge or road segment is modelled. The results are incorporated into a path planning algorithm to find safe route paths for AVs, minimising risk exposures. In addition, Self-Organising Maps (SOM) are employed to identify similar risk groups and individual spatial risk patterns are considered.",0965-8564,Not found
Factors influencing customer's loyalty towards ride-hailing taxi services – A case study of Vietnam,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.008,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"With the emergence of new transport technologies, ride-hailing services have become increasingly popular around the world in recent years. Particularly in developing countries where public transport (PT) systems are normally poor due to the lack of investment, these services have become more prevalent as they are considered as a form of PT mode. Thus, understanding the loyalty intention of ride-hailing passengers is important as it is seen to be a prime determinant of long-term financial performance. Additionally, the operation of these services can increase urban mobility, which can lead to an increase in local spending and government revenue. The aim of this study is to understand better the complexities of factors influencing ride-hailing passenger satisfaction and loyalty intention. The data collected by surveying 559 ride-hailing passengers in Vietnam was analysed using a Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. The findings show that three factors including perceived benefits of the booking app, perceived sales promotion and perceived service quality have direct influences on passenger satisfaction and loyalty in which perceived service quality is more important than the other factors. Insight into the perceptions of passengers provides ride-hailing firms and even their competitors (traditional taxi services) with managerial implications aiming to maintain and increase patronage.",0965-8564,Not found
Holiday travel behavior analysis and empirical study with Integrated Travel Reservation Information usage,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.005,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"The efficient travel demand management is more important than traffic congestion control. Currently, tour reservation system (TRS) based on demand response has become a significant part of travel demand management. The Integrated Travel Reservation Information (ITRI) released by TRS plays an important role in the decision-making process of tourist’s holiday travel destination and departure time choice behaviors, which is seldom investigated. To fill this gap, this paper explored the feedback mechanism among the ITRI usage, tourism utility of various alternatives and tourist decision-making behavior based on the Engel-Kollat-Blackwell (EKB) consumer purchase decision-making model. To quantify the impact of ITRI on travel behavior, a revealed preference and stated preference survey were designed and carried out in China. The data show about 80% of tourists are concerned about the information of tickets sold ratio. Nested Logit (NL) model for the joint choice of destination and departure time was established, which accounted for the impact of TRS and ITRI on the utility of alternatives. The NL model results reveal that tourist’s age, education level, number of visits, ITRI content, ITRI query method and the tickets sold ratio have significant effects on destination and departure time choice. Especially, sensitivity analysis results reveal that when the tickets sold ratio reaches 65%, 75%, 85% and 95% respectively, every 1% growth of tickets sold ratio is accompanied by 2.858%, 2.877%, 3.015% and 3.362% increase in the probabilities of traveling during non-holiday periods. Therefore, tourists are encouraged to travel during non-holiday periods by tickets sold information release, which can achieve the rational allocation of tourism resources and enable to make maximum use of tourism resources. Further, the results can provide a basic data for development of the tourism demand management and equilibrium of the tourist’s spatial and temporal distribution.",0965-8564,Not found
An algorithm for e-bike equivalents at signalized intersections based on traffic conflict events number,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.007,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"The paper presents a new methodology for computing e-bikes equivalents at urban signalized intersections to meet the road spatial demand of e-bikes. By analyzing the measured traffic data of two-phase and four-phase signalized intersections, it is determined that the delay method and the headway method are not applicable to the e-bike Passage Car Equipment (PCE) calculation at intersections. An improved PCE calculation model based on the number of conflict events, speed and traffic volume calculated was established. It is determined that the PCE of left-turning, straight-through and right-turning of e-bikes at two-phase and four-phase signalized intersections are 0.27, 0.34, 0.25 and 0.29, 0.34, 0.27 respectively, and that the variation trend of PCE each turning directions at intersections is different from that of motor vehicles. By analyzing the generation mechanism of the PCE values, it is found that the proposed PCE values of each turning directions have changed reasonably. Compared to the pre-improved model, the traffic capacity calculated by the PCE proposed in this paper is found to be closer to the actual capacities.",0965-8564,Not found
Improved public transportation in rural areas with self-driving cars: A study on the operation of Swiss train lines,10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.020,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Public transport lines, especially train lines, have historically played an important role as economic lifelines of rural areas. They are one of the most important factors contributing to economic prosperity as they provide access to mobility for all the inhabitants of these regions. Maintaining such rural public transport lines can be a challenge due to the low utilization inherent to rural areas. Today, with the emergence of fully self-driving cars, on-demand mobility schemes in which autonomous robotic taxis transport passengers, are becoming possible. In this work, we analyze if rural public transport lines with low utilization can be replaced with autonomous mobility-on-demand systems. More specifically, we compare the existing public transportation infrastructure to hypothetical mobility-on-demand systems both in terms of cost and service level. We perform our analysis, which focuses on the operational aspects, using a simulation approach in which unit-capacity robotic taxis are operated in a street network taking into account congestion effects and state-of-the-art control (dispatching and rebalancing) strategies. Our study considers the case of four rural train lines in Switzerland that operate at low utilization and cost coverage. We show that a unit-capacity mobility-on-demand service with self-driving cars reduces both travel times and operational cost in three out of four cases. In one case, even a service with human driven vehicles would provide higher service levels at lower cost. The results suggest that centrally coordinated mobility-on-demand schemes could be a very attractive option for rural areas.",0965-8564,Not found
Do impact assessments influence transport plans? The case of Sweden,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.002,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"In this study, we investigate what explains the decision by Swedish planners to include an investment in the draft for the Swedish national transport plan 2018–2029 using binary logit models and interviews. Where previous studies have focused on the impact of cost benefit analyses, we broaden the analysis to include other parts of the Swedish appraisal framework, including the distributional and goal fulfilment analyses. We find that even though many aspects of the investments are appraised, few seem to explain investment decisions. The only parts of the appraisal that we find influence investment decisions are the cost benefit-results, the negative non-valuated environmental effects and the assessment of the total socio-economic impact. We find that the distributional analysis, the goal fulfilment analysis or other features of the investments such as if it is a road or a railway hold no explanatory power. The results of the study raise questions about the role of the appraisal procedure and the impact assessments in the planning process. Interviews with planners reveal a number of issues that help explain the limited role of the distributional analysis and the goal-fulfilment analysis, including concerns with the way the distributional analysis and the goal fulfilment analysis are designed. The lack of nuance, as well as the lack of consensus on how to perform the analyses, are put forward as known issues. Furthermore, given the large resources committed to conducting investment appraisals, the paper concludes that the development of infrastructure appraisal frameworks should be based on careful reflection and analysis of the effectiveness of different parts of the appraisal process.",0965-8564,Not found
Addressing the awareness gap: A combined survey and vehicle registration analysis to assess car owners’ usage of ADAS in fleets,10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.018,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Now Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS) have entered the consumer market policymakers need instruments to monitor not only the amount of ADAS-equipped cars but also whether car owners actually use these systems; a prerequisite for many ADAS to achieve road safety and/or CO2 reduction benefits. Although questionnaires provide the most common method for large scale fleet assessment, current questionnaires fall short in their ability to assess ADAS usage. Their main pitfall is that ADAS ownership – necessary to compute the gap between ADAS ownership and usage – is based on self-reported rather than actual ADAS ownership. In other words, it is implicitly presumed that car owners are aware of the ADAS with which their car is, or is not, equipped. To our knowledge, the presumption of awareness of ADAS ownership has not been acknowledged as a limitation in current questionnaire-based studies on ADAS usage. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology to address the awareness gap by combining survey and vehicle registration analysis to assess car owners’ usage of ADAS in fleets. In this method, ADAS awareness constitutes of the difference between ADAS presence based on self-report and ADAS presence based on the vehicle specifications of participants’ own car (obtained through participants’ licence plate registration number). To test both the assumption that an awareness gap exists for ADAS as well as the feasibility of the method itself, a survey was performed under 1355 Dutch business drivers. It involved ADAS such as Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure Warning and Emergency Brake. The study showed that many business drivers were unaware of with which ADAS their car is equipped and as a result, they were unable to report they own the ADAS concerned. However, drivers aware of owning a specific system generally reported that they use it. Additionally, the study revealed another group of participants: those who stated owning a specific ADAS while their vehicle specifications contradict this. In conclusion, awareness of ADAS ownership constitutes an important link that is currently missing when concatenating market penetration studies and regular questionnaires on ADAS usage. The proposed method may overcome this shortcoming, increase the validity of surveys on ADAS usage and provide large scale insights in the use of ADAS throughout an entire fleet of vehicles.",0965-8564,Not found
"An investigation of the open-system Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network and property values: The case of Brisbane, Australia",10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.021,134,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This paper presents an investigation of the open-system Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network on property values. An open-system BRT is one where bus feeder lines can enter and leave the BRT system, depending on their origin or destination so the BRT system infrastructure is shared by multiple routes. Brisbane, Australia is the empirical setting where smartcard (GoCard) data shows that 43% of bus passengers accessed the BRT system from feeder line stops. The paper investigates whether feeder line stops are important for increasing network accessibility in Brisbane’s open-system BRT. The hypothesis underpinning the study is that the improved accessibility resulting from an open-system BRT network results in higher property values within feeder line corridors in addition to simply around the BRT system. A Geographically Weighted Generalized Linear Model (GWGLM) is used to investigate property value premiums and their spatial distribution. GWGLM makes an improvement over Geographically Weighted Regression Model (GWR) by providing flexible local and global variable settings that decrease the risk of multi-collinearity in local models. The results identify property value uplift of up to 1.64% for every 100 m closer to feeder bus stops with frequent services in western and eastern Brisbane suburbs. Future studies should pay attention to the type of BRT operation (whether open- or closed-) in investigating the value of accessibility from BRT implementation. The results are policy relevant for the debate between whether BRT systems should be open or closed.",0965-8564,Not found

Following an analysis of MCDM problems and methods, a new organized approach was created to provide a decision maker with a sub-group of suitable MCDM methods. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the robustness of the outputs from the various candidate methods. A MCDM method is recommended automatically. The recommended candidate method is the one that provided the most robust output (solution to the problem). Only methods that deal with a discrete set of choices were considered. In the Boeing strategic decision presented in this paper, two MCDM methods were compared and a recommendation was made after calculating the minimum percentage change in performance measures and criteria weights required to change the ranking of any two alternatives. An MCDM method was recommended based on a compromise between the minimum percentage change that was required in the inputs to change the ranking of alternatives.

This study uses a survey on residents and subway ridership data from 2014 to 2018 in Beijing to explore the relationship between weather and travel behavior. The results indicate that extreme weather events can affect recreational travel greatly, reduce travel demand, and change travel modes as well. The respondents are inclined to choose subway or cars rather than buses and bicycles under inclement weather days. The analysis of subway ridership confirms that weekends’ trips are more sensitive to weather conditions. Monthly temperature change shows a bigger effect on ridership than daily temperature change. A one-degree increase in effective temperature increases ridership by about 0.5% on weekends, while heavy rain reduces ridership by about 8%. Wind speed and air pollution show significantly negative but small effects on ridership on weekends. Besides, there is a non-linear relationship between temperature and ridership on weekends. These findings suggest that subway is less vulnerable to inclement weather and can be complementary to other travel modes. However, prevention measures are necessary for the subway system to face threats from heavy rain.",0965-8564,Not found

This study investigates whether and how residential relocation leads to changes in travel satisfaction. Using a two-wave questionnaire survey conducted from 2011 to 2013 in Beijing, we compare home movers’ travel satisfaction before and after residential relocation, and further examine how changes in the built environment and that in travel behavior lead to changes in travel satisfaction, taking into consideration the travel-related motivation for home relocation. We find that almost 70% movers reported improvement in travel satisfaction after relocation, suggesting that residential relocation may serve as an opportunity to enhance travel satisfaction; improved neighborhood environments explain increases in travel satisfaction: higher accessibility to facilities, better physical design, enhanced safety and more interactions between neighbors contribute to improved travel satisfaction. On the other hand, increased travel time by transit reduces travel satisfaction. We also find out that relocation motivated by travel-related reasons did not lead to a significant improvement in travel satisfaction.

Spatial and social equity implications for High-Speed Railway lines in Northern Italy,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.028,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The introduction of High-Speed Railways (HSRs) redefines the connections between main territorial hubs, by reducing the travel times and guaranteeing better accessibility. Such infrastructures bring advantages in terms of travel performances, but have also some drawbacks especially for those, generally, mid-size cities that are downgraded. This paper introduces the Spatial and Social Equity Railway Indexes (SpREi and SoREI) to assess the variation in travel times, number of connections, prices and population affected by these changes. Such indexes are then applied in the north-western part of Italy (between the regions of Piedmont and Liguria) to analyse the performances of Alessandria and Asti, two cities that were part of the previous main line Turin-Rome, but have been downgraded to a secondary line after the opening of the new HSR. Their SpREI and SoREI reveal that, despite a slight reduction of travel times, the number of direct connections has decreased with a significant increase in ticket prices. Such performances are then compared to Turin and Genoa, the two main territorial hubs, revealing contradictory results: on the one hand, Turin has registered a performance boost in terms of accessibility and variations in ticket prices. On the other hand, Genoa has seen a low increase in fares and in the number of available connections, whereas average travel times have even increased, thus confirming that the introduction of HSRs may generate inequalities in the territorial connections and hence possible need of compensation by policy makers.",0965-8564,Not found

Dynamic lane restrictions on congested arterials,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.009,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Buses operating in mixed traffic experience problems with delay and travel time variability in peak periods. Numerous transit priority measures are found in the literature but most rely on separating buses from other vehicles. Complete separation such as dedicated bus lanes might underutilize the system capacity when the frequency of buses is not high. We propose a “dynamic bus lane policy”, where control adjusts the proportion of cars to buses in one lane of a multi-lane arterial instead of enforcing complete separation of vehicle types. This strategy is analyzed with aggregated macroscopic dynamics for different models of lane choice. It is shown to benefit both cars and buses by maintaining higher outflow during the peak period and helping the system to recover more quickly at the end of the peak. Greater reductions in travel time are possible with increased information available to vehicles. Analytical derivations and non-linear optimization are then used to obtain the system optimal allocation of cars, as well as the toll needed to achieve it. The system optimal tolling would be difficult to implement in practice. Another optimization which includes tolls paid in its objective is nearly as good at reducing vehicle hours traveled and produces a much simpler pricing structure amenable to feedback control. A microsimulation with feedback control confirms the results of the macroscopic model and shows additional benefits attributable to driver behavior. Future work will look into varying control parameters to achieve a global minimum travel time and will incorporate user heterogeneity to test pricing strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
"Why have multiple climate policies for light-duty vehicles? Policy mix rationales, interactions and research gaps",10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.011,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Globally, there are a wide variety of policies in place that could help contribute to deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions in the light-duty vehicle sector. Most regions are impacted by a mix of such policies. However, the transportation literature has devoted little attention to policy mixes, especially in the light-duty vehicles sector, so here we review and draw insights from the broader, mostly non-transport literature. We identify several rationales for pursuing mixes of policies: (i) the “three legs” approach to transport decarbonization, namely that different policies should address different GHG reduction areas (low-carbon fuels, vehicle efficiency and reduced travel demand), (ii) the “market failure” perspective that a different policy is needed to correct each market failure, (iii) the “political process” perspective that considers the real-world need for a policy mix to be perceived as political acceptability, and (iv) the “systems” perspective that policy needs to send signals to channel technological innovation and break the lock-in of incumbent practices. Based on this review, we develop a simple framework for examining policy interactions across multiple criteria, namely GHG mitigation, cost-effectiveness, political acceptability, and transformative signal. We demonstrate this framework by setting hypotheses for interactions across six light-duty vehicle policies in the case of British Columbia, Canada – including a carbon tax, electric vehicle purchase incentives, infrastructure deployment, and three regulations. We conclude with a summary of important research gaps and implications for policy design, as well as quantitative modeling.",0965-8564,Not found
A model of deadheading trips and pick-up locations for ride-hailing service vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.015,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The mode share of app-based ride-hailing services has been growing steadily in recent years and this trend is expected to continue. Ride-hailing services generate two types of trips – passenger hauling trips and deadheading trips. Passenger hauling trips are the trips made while transporting passengers between places. Virtually all other trips made by a ride-hailing vehicle when there are no passengers in the vehicle are called deadheading trips or empty trips. Trips between the drop-off location of one passenger and the pick-up location of the next passenger could comprise a substantial share of total travel by ride-hailing vehicles, both in terms of number of trips and miles of travel. This paper aims to model the deadheading trips produced by app-based ride-hailing services at the disaggregate level of individual trips. Passenger trip data published by the app-based ride-hailing company Ride Austin is used to impute deadheading trips. The pick-up locations of passengers are then modeled using a nonlinear-in-parameters multinomial logit framework, essentially capturing the deadheading that takes place from the drop-off of one passenger to the pick-up of the next passenger. The model is sensitive to socio-demographic characteristics, as well as employment opportunities and built environment characteristics of the study area. The model results shed light on the characteristics of deadheading trips at different locations and at different time periods in a day. The paper concludes with a discussion of how transportation planners and app-based ride-hailing companies may utilize knowledge about deadheading to enact policies and pricing schemes that reduce deadheading.",0965-8564,Not found

This study analyzes recent bus stop improvements made by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) to determine whether, and to what extent, the improvements are associated with changes in stop-level ridership and demand for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit service in the areas immediately surrounding improved bus stops. The study compares ridership and paratransit demand from before and after the improvements at the treated stops and at a set of unimproved stops selected using propensity score matching to control for demographic, land use, and regional accessibility influences. The analysis shows that the improved bus stops are associated with a statistically significant increase in overall ridership and a decrease in paratransit demand, compared to the control group stops. These outcomes are important for transit service providers as they seek to increase overall ridership and reduce costs associated with providing paratransit service.",0965-8564,Not found

We analyze the evolution of 32 countries’ commercial maritime power since the inception of the B&R Initiative. The main findings are as follows. First, our evaluation system of commercial maritime power consists of a hierarchy containing 4 components, 7 elements, and 32 factors. Second, the evolution of a country’s commercial maritime power can be assessed. The results show that countries along the routes of the initiative show good performances in the evolution of commercial maritime power. Third, we find that Vietnam not China shows the highest average annual growth rate.",0965-8564,Not found
Urban households’ purchase intentions for pure electric vehicles under subsidy contexts in China: Do cost factors matter?,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.012,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Subsidies are used to promote pure electric vehicle adoption. Whether cost factors are the dominant factors influencing households’ purchase intentions under subsidy contexts is unknown, which is meaningful as subsidies decrease. To explore whether cost factors influence Chinese urban households’ purchase intentions for electric vehicles under subsidy contexts, we conducted a questionnaire survey among Chinese urban households, which covers eight economic regions (or 30 provinces). We extended the theory of planned behaviour with the norm activation model as the theoretical framework and utilised a structural equation model to analyse these collected survey data. We built the van Westendorp price sensitivity model to measure urban households’ price preferences for pure electric vehicles. The results indicate that under subsidy contexts cost factors do not significantly influence urban households’ purchase intentions for pure electric vehicles in China, and people are more concerned about cruising power and charging-facility availability. Besides, subjective norms, feelings and emotions, personal norms, and perceived behavioural control affect urban households’ purchase intentions. Influencing factors vary from household groups with or without cars. Urban families’ acceptable price range for pure electric vehicles is CNY65,000 to CNY120,000.",0965-8564,Not found

"Noise, odor and passenger density in perceived crowding in public transport",10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.013,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Public transport is being promoted worldwide to help resolve the environmental and congestion problems besetting cities. Travel comfort is increasingly seen as crucial to effecting the switch from private motorized modes to public transit. The purpose of this study is to measure the physical and human factors impacting travel comfort on mass urban rail transport. Randomly selected passengers (n = 368) commuting in subway cars at 14 levels of in-vehicle passenger density were intercepted to evaluate their satisfaction with the following factors related to comfort: crowding, noise, smell, air quality, temperature, illumination, vibration and safety from crime. Satisfaction with regard to crowding was negatively and linearly related to the number of passengers in the subway car. In the multiple regression model, however, perceived noise intensity accounted for more than the actual number of individuals in the car in the evaluation of crowding, with smell as a second significant contributor. Other significant factors in travel comfort included air quality, temperature, and fear of crime. Although it is found that objectively measured passenger crowding explains a major part of perceived travel comfort, other factors associated with the ambient environment are at least as important. Corrective measures to improve travel comfort could address the ambient environmental factors in the medium term, while the structural issue of over-crowding needs to be addressed in the longer term.",0965-8564,Not found

Free-floating bikesharing in Vienna – A user behaviour analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.020,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Free-floating bikesharing (FFBS) is a fairly new mobility service. It spread rapidly throughout Europe’s major urban areas in 2017; a development accompanied by a variety of problems that soon culminated in a retreat of providers from most cities. The main characteristic of FFBS is the absence of fixed docking stations; instead, users can borrow and leave the bikes wherever they want as long as they adhere to traffic rules and the operators’ regulations. Its market entry has caused controversial public debates, although – or even because – little is known about this new mobility service, its users, their motivators as well as usage patterns. One of the FFBS pioneer cities in Europe was Vienna with two FFBS operators providing their services from summer 2017 onwards. Although both withdrew from the city within a year, it was possible to collect and analyse user data in order to gain an understanding of the factors supporting FFBS usage. For this purpose, the research uses a series of discrete choice models explaining why some people (i) share bikes (including FFBS and the established Viennese station-based scheme), (ii) try out the new FFBS scheme and (iii) remain with the new FFBS scheme or quit the membership. Reasons for users to try FFBS are very similar to those of station-based bikesharing as reported in literature. Subjective factors including attitudes and degree of satisfaction with system features are gaining in importance within the series of models. They are particularly decisive for remaining with the FFBS scheme.",0965-8564,Not found
Regional impact of rail network accessibility on residential property price: Modelling spatial heterogeneous capitalisation effects in Hong Kong,10.1016/j.tra.2020.01.025,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"With new rail lines, residents can enjoy higher accessibility and more activity opportunities. However, better access to public transport can potentially increase land prices in catchment areas. In this research, we aim to investigate whether this capitalisation effect goes beyond the conventional catchment area and how such an effect varies across different regions. In a departure from previous studies, we employed a gravity-based accessibility measure to capture the regional impact of rail lines using a cross-sectional analysis of 2001 and 2011 residential apartment data in Hong Kong and a difference-in-difference approach to estimate repeated sales transacted in both years. We used a three-level hierarchical estimation method that allowed the price effect to vary by submarket. The results indicated that the network accessibility of rail lines had a statistically significant capitalisation effect on property prices that varied across different submarkets. Although the three major new rail lines had a greater impact on the built environment in suburban areas, the elasticities in property price with regard to accessibility were still larger in urban areas in both 2001 and 2011. We also establish that the improvements in rail accessibility had a substantially greater effect on the changes in property price between 2001 and 2011 in several new town submarkets along the new lines. From a regional perspective, we conclude that the price effect of new transport infrastructure goes beyond the local catchment areas and call for urban policies that address housing affordability issues across different submarkets in the region and a re-examination of land value capture policies.",0965-8564,Not found
Optimal traffic management policies for mixed human and automated traffic flows,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.007,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Although Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) will enhance mobility and safety, their impact on congestion is not clear yet. AVs may increase roadway capacity due to their connectivity features. The capacity enhancement highly depends on the AV proportion in traffic. This study models user equilibrium traffic assignment when the link capacity is a function of AV proportion of traffic. The mixed traffic flow of AVs and human-driven vehicles is considered as a multiclass traffic assignment problem. This problem is formulated as a non-linear complementarity problem which is solved to find optimal traffic management policies. We show that simple policies such as AV exclusive links can improve network performance in mixed traffic of AVs and human-driven vehicles. We also show that if these policies are implemented the network performance would be very close to system optimal condition even when users choose their routes selfishly following a user equilibrium. Results of numerical examples for a real size network show that management policies can decrease the gap between user equilibrium and system optimal to less than 1%.",0965-8564,Not found
An empirical evaluation of different usage pattern between car-sharing battery electric vehicles and private ones,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.014,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"As a non-ownership business mode, a car-sharing service system has received an extensive popularization recently. Many related studies based on the theoretical and questionnaire analyses have confirmed the existence of differences in usage patterns between car-sharing users and private users. Nowadays, usage data provides a new way to analyze and understand the usage pattern of vehicles, which can improve user experience. To study the usage of car-sharing cars and private ones, namely, to study their usage patterns, this paper proposes an evaluation indicator system for usage pattern based on the battery electric vehicle (BEV) data. The evaluation indicator system is based on the state transition approach and describes the usage pattern of BEVs from three dimensions. The travel temporal and travel spatial dimensions describe the time and space characteristics of usage pattern. The decision-making dimension, as a cause of state transition at the micro level, describes the decision-making pattern according to a conceptual psychological model. Finally, an empirical study using the promotion is undertaken to explore differences in the performance of the two BEV types using the real-world usage data. Results show that the evaluation indicator system can identify the differences in usage pattern between car-sharing BEVs and private ones effectively and objectively from different perspectives. According to the analysis results, the car-sharing BEVs are used to satisfy more usage-purposes of users, and sharing users tend to have a higher demand for speed and show lower aversiveness of low-range driving situations at the psychological level.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact on bus ridership of passenger incentive contracts in public transport,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.003,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Over the years, passenger incentives have increasingly been used in Swedish public bus transport to increase ridership by introducing passenger incentive contracts. In 2015, half of all active contracts were of this type. In those contracts, operator revenue comprises production-related revenue and a per-passenger–based incentive payment. Using rich passenger data, this paper analyses whether the ridership increase in the Skåne region can be attributed to the introduction of this contract type. The results cannot prove that passenger incentive contracts have increased ridership more than traditional gross-cost contracts. This is probably because both the per-passenger payment and operator freedom to adjust traffic provision are too low. While simulation studies have previously shown that higher payments and freedoms would increase bus ridership, it is unclear whether public transport authorities should leave the freedom to adjust traffic provision to operators, given the authorities’ social welfare responsibility. Instead, factors outside the contract, such as car-restricting measures and improved bus road space, might be more effective in increasing the number of passengers.",0965-8564,Not found
Who are more likely to break the rule of congestion charging? Evidence from an active scheme with no referendum voting,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.008,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Although previous studies have explored predictors of Congestion Charging (CC) acceptability and acceptance, there is no study investigating the rule-breaking behaviour towards a CC scheme. The current study thus examined the effects of a wide range of attitudinal factors as well as demographic, socioeconomic, built environment and travel-related characteristics on rule-breaking/following behaviour towards an ongoing CC scheme. Our major contribution to the state of the art is threefold: (a) we reveal the extent to which citizens break the rule of an active scheme and illegally drive through the CC area, (b) we simultaneously test the relative roles of several latent attitudinal and observed variables in the type of rule-breaking/following conduct in an integrated framework through developing a hybrid choice model, and (c) we empirically investigate how and to what extent the level of legitimacy of an active CC scheme appears in a city in the Middle East context, where politicians have neglected the direct participation of public via referendum voting in the policy process behind the introduction of the CC. A sample of car users was recruited during February and March 2019 in Tehran. A cross-sectional design using a self-report questionnaire survey was conducted. Out of 622 citizens participated in this study, 595 valid observations were used for analysis. Our findings showed significant difference between predictors for those frequently (mono-rule breakers) broke and those who rarely or occasionally (multi rule-breakers) broke the rule of CC. The finding also revealed that latent attitudinal factors could have greater impacts on rule-breaking behaviour than observed variables. Lack of trust in government concerning final use of CC revenues and a lower perceived effectiveness of the CC had the strongest influence on the probability of violating the CC rule. We suggested both short and long-term policies to deal with the issues of legitimacy and survival of the CC scheme. With regard to short-term policy, using media and social networks, the issue of complexity and lack of information about the charging system need to be well-addressed. Considering long-term policy, entrusting management system from governmental authorities to a private system as well as launching environmental campaigns could increase the public trust and effectiveness of the CC scheme, respectively.",0965-8564,Not found
Technological advances relevant to transport – understanding what drives them,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.002,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Transport policy makers are increasingly perplexed by the pace of change in their sector and by the increasing influence of external actors. This leads to a variety of responses, including “business as usual”, technological optimism, technological fatalism and technological ignorance. To explore this perplexity and its justification, we examine four areas of technological advance relevant to transport: mobility as a service; unmanned aerial vehicles (drones); automated vehicles; and telehealth. In each case, we identify the principal underlying shifts which are driving these technological advances, concluding that there is considerable overlap: three of the advances rely on ubiquitous sensing and on artificial intelligence and all four rely, to some degree, on connectedness. We then explore these three “drivers”, finding that progress is steadier than may be generally thought. We discuss the implications for our set of transport-related technological developments, concluding that policy makers could approach the future with greater confidence than is currently typical. They could also draw on the concepts of anticipatory governance to support their management of emerging technology and, at the same time, of the influence of external actors.",0965-8564,Not found
Spatial spillover effects of logistics infrastructure on regional development: Evidence from China,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.022,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Considering the connectivity characteristics of the logistics infrastructure between adjacent areas, this paper examines the possibility of spatial spillover effects of logistics infrastructure in Chinese regions by applying a spatial Durbin model for the time period 2003–2017 and two sub-periods, 2003–2009 and 2010–2017. At the national level, the results indicate that positive spillover exists in each period of logistics infrastructure. At the regional level, each logistics infrastructure variable’s spillover effects vary considerably among China’s three macro-regions: land transport in the central and western regions are significantly negative; air transport is positive but not significant in eastern, central, and western regions; water transport is negative in eastern and central regions; courier delivery is not significant in eastern and western regions; internet is negative in eastern and western regions; storage is positive in eastern and central regions.

Quantifying the impact of urban road networks on the efficiency of local trips,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.015,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"City-level circuity factors have been introduced to quantify and compare the directness of vehicular travel across different cities. While these city-level factors help to improve the quality of distance approximation functions for city-wide vehicle movements, more granular factors are needed to obtain accurate shortest path distance approximations for last-mile transportation systems that are typically characterized by local trips. More importantly, local circuity factors encode valuable information about the efficiency and complexity of the urban road network, which can be leveraged to inform policy and practice. In this paper, we quantify and analyze local network circuity leveraging contemporary traffic datasets. Using the city of São Paulo as our primary case study and a combination of supervised and un-supervised machine learning methods, we observe significant heterogeneities in local network circuity, explained by dimensional and topological properties of the road network. Locally, real trip distances are about twice as long as distances predicted by the L 1 norm. Results from São Paulo are compared to seven additional urban areas in Latin America and the United States. At a coarse-grained level of analysis, we observe similar correlations between road network properties and local circuity across these cities.",0965-8564,Not found

The overlapping hinterland between two ports grows with the constant development of transport chains. A variety of subsidies offered to shippers by ports were put into practice for larger hinterland freight volume to improve port competitiveness. A study of the effects of shipper subsidies on port profits showed the following. (1) An individual port’s implementation of the subsidy strategy will expand its market share and increase its profits. (2) The competing port’s optimal response is to offer subsidies after another port has given subsidies. The optimal subsidy amounts of these two ports are the shippers’ inland transport costs. (3) Two final possibilities exist for stable states with two-port subsidy competition, that is, either both ports or neither port grants subsidies. These subsidies are associated with inland transport costs and port capacities. Considerations are given according to numerical analysis of the influence of marginal congestion cost alterations on undifferentiated positions, two-port profits, shipper surplus and social utility. The result shows that the marginal congestion costs increase will increase the profits of larger port, but will constantly lessen the shipper surplus and social utility. If both ports provide subsidies, the shipper surplus and social utility are better than those of the two ports that do not offer subsidies.",0965-8564,Not found
"Transport policy, rail freight sector and market structure: The economic effects in Brazil",10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.018,135,2020-05-01,2020,5,"After fifteen years of railway concessions in Brazil, the rail freight sector became responsible for over 26% of the total transported volume in the country, an increase of 20% during this period. This Brazilian experience led a recovery in productivity and investment levels, with an improvement in service quality and modernization of the sector. Nevertheless, the rail price control mechanisms were almost unrestricted, allowing the concessionaires keep prices at very high levels. Just in 2012, it was held the first revision of price cap regulation of the sector. In this paper, we analyze the long-turn economic impacts of the rail freight sector tariff review policy in Brazil through the use of a dynamic general equilibrium model. The model incorporates some forms of market imperfections within its theoretical structure. Regardless the assumptions attributed to productive system, the main findings suggest that tariff policies promote positive effects on GDP growth, exports, and investments, as well as on other sectors, such as those most intensive in freight railways.

Area-based equitable pricing strategies for multimodal urban networks with heterogeneous users,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.009,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Equity issues among travellers are critical in congestion pricing. Failure to treat equity can lead to low acceptability towards pricing. In this paper, we develop congestion pricing schemes to improve both equity and traffic performance, for multimodal networks. We consider the equity issue by the existence of heterogeneous population, with respect to income level and value-of-time (VOT). An optimization framework is formulated for obtaining optimal toll schemes. We apply an aggregated network-level traffic flow model to reproduce congestion dynamics and mode choice behavior. The gain and loss for VOT-based user groups are investigated and discussed. We carry out simulation analysis over two pricing schemes: a unified toll and a VOT-based toll. In particular, we allow during the optimization process the VOT-based toll to obtain negative values for some users if it meets some system objectives. Our results confirm that significant differences in behavior and cost savings exist among groups, which justifies the need for a VOT-based pricing. It also demonstrates that properly-designed VOT-based tolls can improve the inequity in savings, e.g. users whose VOT values are lower may receive larger travel cost savings. Furthermore, a policy-oriented discussion on the design and implementation of the proposed equitable pricing schemes is provided.",0965-8564,Not found
On the commute travel pattern with compressed work schedule,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.014,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Compressed work schedule (CW) is one of the widely known flexible work hours arrangements (FWAs). In the literature, it has been clearly demonstrated that CW can significantly reduce commuting trips per pay period and thereby relieve peak hour congestion. Without policy intervention, how many firms will choose CW? Is it socially beneficial to encourage all commuters to switch to CW? This paper mainly addresses these questions. A bi-level economic model encapsulating employers’ and employees’ choices on their work schedule is then developed. Firstly, the short-run daily and periodic commute patterns of employees are investigated in a modified activity-based bottleneck model. On top of that, the effects of CW on firms’ productivity are incorporated into our long-run analysis. At long-run equilibrium, no employers and employees can benefit by unilaterally switching their schedule type or changing their schedule design. Multiple equilibria are found with the different number of CW users, depending on the agglomeration rate of productivity and the initial status. The social optimums to maximize total net utility are also determined. At a low rate of agglomeration, it is socially beneficial to introduce CW and the system can achieve the social optimum naturally at long-run equilibrium with positive CW users, under mild assumptions. However, when the agglomeration rate is high, the social optimum is no longer achieved, and workers would stick to the normal schedule at equilibrium if the initial case without CW is considered. This can partially explain why CW is not commonly adopted in practice.",0965-8564,Not found
Does lacking a car put the brakes on activity participation? Private vehicle access and access to opportunities among low-income adults,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.021,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Private vehicle travel entails costs to society. However, in a world designed around the automobile, adults who lack access to a vehicle for economic reasons may experience a significant handicap due to constrained mobility and accessibility. This paper examines whether private vehicle access is associated with the quantity and quality of out-of-home activities in which low-income individuals participate. We use pooled data from multiple time use surveys drawn from the Netherlands, Canada, Spain, and the United Kingdom, and employ Cragg two-part hurdle modeling to determine whether there is an association between household vehicle access and participation in twelve out-of-home activity types. As a robustness check, we also estimate multiple discrete continuous extreme value (MDCEV) models. Further, we examine travel time by mode for those with and without vehicles. Finally, we use American Time Use Survey data and fixed-effects panel models to determine the subjective well-being that is associated with our out-of-home activity types. A lack of private vehicle access is associated with significantly less frequent out-of-home activity participation, both in the aggregate and for seven of the twelve individual activities. Moreover, the activities most likely to be foregone are generally associated with high subjective well-being, suggesting that constrained mobility comes with significant emotional costs. We find a greater “activity penalty” for rural residents and for Canadian residents without vehicle access; urbanites without vehicles in the U.K. are the only geographic group which do not exhibit an activity penalty. Finally, respondents with vehicle access spend more total time traveling, although those without private vehicles partially offset spending less time in them with higher use of alternative modes. Overall, the findings suggest that the lack of a private vehicle is deleterious for quality of life, raising troubling questions about inequity possibly arising when people are denied access to vehicles for economic reasons.",0965-8564,Not found
Why is active travel more satisfying than motorized travel? Evidence from Dublin,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.007,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Some trips are better than others, and more and more studies find that active travel (walking and cycling) is more satisfying than motorized forms of travel (using the car or public transport). Why is this the case? Using data on travel satisfaction from 4134 commutes to a large University campus in Dublin, Ireland, this paper replicates the differences in travel satisfaction between active and motorized travel. We attribute these differences in large part to the duration of the trip. Subjective trip characteristics, such as safety and convenience, also play important roles. The trip duration explains rush-hour effects as well as why people starting from less affluent and more difficult-to-reach places are less satisfied with their trips. Longer-term policy options suggested by these results include infrastructure developments and spatial development strategies. A shorter-term initiative would be to delay university schedules in the morning to avoid low travel satisfaction during the slow rush-hour period and simultaneously ease pressure on the transport network at peak times.",0965-8564,Not found

Specifically, the dogit model is adopted to account for captive mode travelers in the modal split problem, and the path-size logit (PSL) model is used to capture route overlapping effects in the traffic assignment problem. The dogit-PSL MMNE model is formulated as an equivalent entropy-based mathematical programming (MP) problem, which admits solution existence and uniqueness. Three numerical examples are provided. The first example examines the effects of mode captivity and route overlapping on network performances and observes that accounting for captive mode travelers would produce different equilibrium states and hence the network performance indicators. The second example applies the dogit-PSL MMNE model for evaluating the exclusive bus lane (EBL) expansion plans, in which a consistent synthetic proportional index is proposed. Numerical results show that considering mode captivity may produce substantial impacts on the odds (up to 50 percent of odds in the given scenarios) of making different EBL line expansion decisions.

Coupled application of generative adversarial networks and conventional neural networks for travel mode detection using GPS data,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.005,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Inferring travel modes of travelers in the city is important to transportation planning and infrastructure design. Based on the distribution of travel modes, transportation engineers could provide some proper strategies to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. With advanced sensing techniques, it is possible to collect high-resolution GPS trajectory data of travelers and we can infer travel modes using some popular machine learning methods. One of the difficult tasks facing the application of machine learning especially deep learning in travel mode detection is the lack of large, labeled dataset, because to label the trajectory data is expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, samples of different travel modes are always unbalanced. Accordingly, in this paper, we take advantage of the generative model and the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to develop a hybrid travel modes detection model using less labeled trajectory data. Our key contribution is the utilization of a generative adversarial network (GAN) to artificially create some training samples in such a way that it not only increases the required sample size but balances the dataset to improve the accuracy of the detection model. Furthermore, CNN is applied to extract deep features of trajectory data, and then to classify the travel modes. The results show that the highest accuracy (86.70%) can be achieved by the proposed model. In particular, the proposed method can improve the detection accuracy of bus and driving modes because it can solve the small sample size problem. Moreover, the large sample size can provide an opportunity to develop some advanced deep learning models in future studies.",0965-8564,Not found

On the role of route choice modeling in transit sketchy design,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.010,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Sketchy design models are used to examine the fundamental tradeoff in transit systems and to guide high-level decisions. Traditionally, passengers’ route choice is greatly simplified in such models. This study aims to understand whether this simplification would compromise qualitatively the results expected from the sketchy models. To this end, three transit systems, which all offer competitive alternative routes, are analyzed using the continuous approximation approach. We test what the impact on transit system performance (e.g. optimal designs and system costs) would be if travelers somehow split between these routes, rather than concentrate on the “best” one. A random utility model is employed to enable a probabilistic assignment of passengers to different routes according to the “perceived” utility. Analytical methods are then developed to estimate the aggregate share of each route in each system, based on which the user cost is obtained. Numerical results show that, while stochastic route choice modestly increases the optimal user cost, it has a negligible effect on the agency cost. Furthermore, the actual system design is largely insensitive to route choice modeling. Thus, while the simplest deterministic route choice assumption may not be valid in all systems, transit planners can safely ignore route choice details in most cases, at least for the purpose of strategic planning.",0965-8564,Not found
A diffusion model for estimating adoption patterns of a one-way carsharing system in its initial years,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.027,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Oneway carsharing service operators must assess the importance of each station relative to overall demand if resources are limited. We propose a variation of an innovation diffusion model designed to estimate new “hesitant” and “fast” adopters for different stations of a one-way carsharing system to understand system adoption dynamics better over time and to derive policy implications. We forecast the number of monthly new adopters and potential market of stations considering their synergistic effects. We further reflect the spatially diverse adoption dynamics during the initial years of a carsharing service. Stations are classified into four groups based on their location and demand pattern. The models are estimated using data from the Ha:mo RIDE carsharing system in Toyota, Japan. We observe two peaks in the new user curve that our model can explain. We propose that the initial peak is caused by information diffusion, whereas the later peak is due to market saturation. Policy relevant implications are that we observe a low degree of follower effect and that new stations in strategic locations are essential for continued demand growth. More specifically, we suggest that carsharing stations in residential areas experience demand stagnation fast, whereas continued demand growth can be expected and quantified for carsharing stations around transit hubs and public facilities. Therefore carsharing operators need to be aware that assessing the importance of a station for the overall system requires time as well as consideration of synergy effect with other service points.",0965-8564,Not found
Automated drivability: Toward an assessment of the spatial deployment of level 4 automated vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.024,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Two scenarios have shaped the discussion on the deployment of automated vehicles (AVs). The first is the revolutionary or disruptive scenario, in which a competitor would reach fully automated vehicles (level 5) in one giant leap. The second scenario renders the deployment of AVs as a lengthy process of evolutionary vehicle automation, progressing from specialized, controlled and restricted conditions, i.e. operational design domains (ODDs), to ever more complex ones. But as it becomes more and more clear that there are large uncertainties about how far in the future level 5 AVs become available, in the near future situations in which the driver is replaced completely, i.e. not requiring driver interventions, only seem feasible in specific ODDs and cities will likely be faced by highly automated vehicles (level 4) equipped with automated driving systems (ADSs) for specific ODDs over a longer period. However, cities comprise different street spaces with various conditions which lead to different requirements for the ADSs and could affect the deployment of level 4 AVs and thus the impacts of AVs in cities in the near future. This paper presents a framework and related indicators for assessing the automated drivability, i.e. the suitability of street spaces for the functioning operation of ADSs from a technical-infrastructural point of view, based on the relationship between the current technological development state of ADSs and different (urban) street spaces. Using the case study of the city of Vienna in Austria to apply the framework, a set of indicators for the different components of the framework is calculated and integrated to build an automated drivability index (ADX), illustrating the automated drivability within the street network. The results are a first step to indicate which areas are more suitable for level 4 AVs from a technological point of view, as well as areas where a deployment of AVs would only be possible after larger adjustments of the infrastructure or at considerably lower than intended speeds; thus, detailing the complexity of driving urban street spaces in a yet unprecedented level. Besides other aspects this can give hints for policy makers and other stakeholders where to facilitate the deployment of AVs.",0965-8564,Not found
"Competitive tendering, ownership and cost efficiency in road maintenance services in Sweden: A panel data analysis",10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.004,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"This paper uses econometric methods to study the cost efficiency of road maintenance provision in Sweden for the first time. The novelty lies in the application of econometric techniques to a new and rich panel dataset (73 contracts; 11 years, 2004–2014) with a wide range of variables and approaches to controlling for heterogeneity (including weather variation). The analysis is applied in the context of a sector where all road maintenance contracts are subject to competitive tendering, but with a state-run provider competing against private firms. The key focus is whether, even after competitive tendering, efficiency differences remain between the state provider and private entrants. We find that the state-run provider has significantly higher costs (between 8 and 20%) than private firms despite holding 60% of the market. The results suggest that substantial savings are possible through opening up road maintenance to the private sector through competition for the market; but that in Sweden, the tendering process is still not working optimally. Further research is needed to understand why the current cost gap persists between public and private providers, despite competitive tendering having been present across the whole market for several years.",0965-8564,Not found
Analysis of port choice: A methodological proposal adjusted with public data,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.031,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"The availability of public databases provides a great amount of data for research, but their use can involve a lack of detailed information about the decision-makers. This fact prevents the analysis of systematic variations in their preferences. In addition, the influence of the explanatory variables included in the utility function of discrete choice models is not necessarily linear. The analysis of the port choice process through this kind of models has usually been addressed neglecting both the existence of heterogeneity in the preferences and the non-linearity in the variables. In this paper, a Box-Cox Mixed Logit Model is proposed to overcome both constraints, and it is introduced through a case study. In the aim to highlight the interest of the proposal made, the obtained results were compared with those of the more traditional formulations. The conclusion is that this model provides more accurate results. Therefore, it can better help policy-makers when assessing hypothetical scenarios to define their competitive strategies because conclusions can vary significantly, as can be seen from the prognosis carried out for the Spanish case.",0965-8564,Not found
The value of physical distribution flexibility in serving dense and uncertain urban markets,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.011,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Urban last-mile distribution in emerging economies suffers from unique levels of operational complexity, largely due to the prevailing dominance of the highly fragmented traditional retail channel. To support companies in strategically designing efficient urban distribution networks in such uncertain market environments, we propose a large-scale stochastic mixed integer linear programming model that incorporates three commonly deployed measures of physical distribution flexibility. Being able to flexibly adjust transportation capacities, facility capacities, and demand allocations may enable companies to serve urban markets more efficiently, especially in the presence of demand uncertainty. The model supports strategic network design decisions by optimizing the number, type, and capacity of distribution facilities as well as the composition of corresponding vehicle fleets. We apply the model to two large-scale, real-world case studies based on real data from Coca-Cola Femsa’s last-mile operations in Bogotá and Cali, Colombia. These case studies are representative for many last-mile distribution problems in emerging market megacities. Our numerical results demonstrate how considering stochasticity and incorporating physical distribution flexibility in the strategic design of urban last-mile distribution networks jointly and independently affect the resulting network design and improve its commercial and operational performance. The stochastic design approach outperforms the deterministic design approach on every instance in terms of expected cost and performance risk. In most cases, physical distribution flexibility improves performance. However, we show that in some cases, if strategic decisions are based on deterministic assumptions, allowing for operational flexibility may result in a deterioration in network performance.",0965-8564,Not found
People's current mobility costs and willingness to pay for Mobility as a Service offerings,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.034,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a concept that is based on the idea of providing customers with comprehensive mobility services by seamlessly combining various modes of transport. The scientific research on this theme has increased considerably over the last few years, but very little research has so far been conducted on people’s willingness to pay for new MaaS services. This study presents the results of a survey (representative sample size 6,000, number of respondents 1,176, response rate 19.6%) conducted in Finland regarding people’s willingness to pay for MaaS offerings. The study also estimates the current mobility costs of the respondents and relates their willingness to pay for MaaS to their mobility costs. Analysis includes also a linear regression model of willingness to pay for MaaS. As a result of the study, it was found that 43% of the respondents would be willing to adopt a mobility package, assuming it could cover all mobility needs of the respondent. For such a mobility package, the respondents were willing to pay approximately €140 on average, while their relative willingness to pay was an average of approximately 64% of their current mobility costs. However, it should be noted that due the limitations of the study, the results are mostly indicative and further research is called for to grasp the multifaceted qualitative elements related to willingness to pay for MaaS. This study shows some significant variation between user groups in the respondents’ willingness to pay relative to their estimated mobility costs, as well as their absolute willingness to pay. The variation maybe due to the fact that MaaS is still largely unknown as a concept and the challenge that the mobility package which fulfils individual needs differs from person to person. According to the results, MaaS should lower the mobility costs for users in order to be financially attractive.",0965-8564,Not found
Who and where rideshares? Rideshare travel and use in Los Angeles,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.001,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Carpooling rates in America have been falling for decades. But new technologies may offer solutions to traditional carpooling barriers and usher in a new chapter in shared car travel. Ride-hail services connect riders to drivers through smartphone applications. The largest ride-hail companies, Uber and Lyft, offer shared carpool (rideshare) services to connect riders traveling in the same directions and at the same times. Although researchers have recently begun to understand who uses ride-hail services, few have yet investigated ridesharing. To fill this gap, I ask and answer two questions. First, what factors are associated with where ridesharing occurs? Second, what factors are associated with who rideshares? To answer both questions, I use trip-level data of 6.3 million Lyft trips, including 1.9 million Lyft Shared trips, taken in Los Angeles County in 2016. Findings reveal that while about one-third of Lyft trips are on Lyft Shared, these rideshare trips are made by a small fraction of ride-hail users. Just one-third of ride-hail users made even one rideshare trip over the three-month study period, and just ten percent of all Lyft riders made 94 percent of rideshare trips. People living in dense and lower-income neighborhoods share a higher proportion of ride-hail trips compared to riders living in other neighborhoods. Less ridesharing occurs in racial and ethnically diverse neighborhoods compared to neighborhoods where clear racial or ethnic majorities exist. Cities seeking to increase sharing in ride-hail services should focus efforts on attracting non-users, including pricing to encourage shared rather than solo car trips. Implemented policies should avoid undercutting demand for transit or active travel, which remain the most efficient modes on our streets.",0965-8564,Not found

Using retrospective survey data in Nanjing, this study investigates the impacts of SDD online shopping on local store shopping. Quasi-longitudinal analyses of the retrospective data show that SDD online shopping substitutes for local store shopping, and that changes in local shopping are associated with SDD online shopping frequency. These results suggest that SDD online shopping may change local shopping travel and alter the distribution of commercial land uses over time. Moreover, a comparison between quasi-longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses suggests that cross-sectional results are not reliable.

Time use: The role of sleep,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.025,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Time use models have been used to estimate the value of leisure - one of the components of the value of travel time savings - usually accepting that sleep duration is an exogenous variable. In this paper, we depart from this belief by considering time asleep as an endogenous decision framed by many elements well documented in the literature which we review using a three-discipline perspective: Social behavior sciences, Medical and health sciences, and Economics. Then we propose a microeconomic model that considers these contributions by capturing four effects: alertness (perception), time use trade-off, performance (productivity) and a series of technical relations linking sleep with other activities and goods consumption. The analytical properties are explored showing that there is a total value of sleep time with different components, that equals the value of leisure; that the value of time assigned to any other activity and the value of leisure increase with sleep time if the person sleeps less than medically recommended; and that the way in which sleep time acts on the value of travel time savings varies according to specific behavioral parameters related with the perception of sleep, work and leisure.

Who's ditching the bus?,10.1016/j.tra.2020.02.016,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"This paper uses stop-level passenger count data in four cities to understand the bus ridership decline between 2012 and 2018. The local characteristics associated with ridership change are evaluated in Portland, Miami, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta. Poisson models explain ridership as a cross-section and the change thereof as a panel. While controlling for the change in frequency, jobs, and population, the correlation with local socio-demographic characteristics are investigated using data from the American Community Survey. The effect of changing neighborhood demographics on bus ridership are modeled using Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data. At a point in time, neighborhoods with high proportions of non-white, carless, and most significantly, high-school-educated residents are the most likely to have high ridership. Over time, the share of white residents is correlated with ridership decline. In Miami and Atlanta, places with high concentrations of residents with college education and without access to a car also lose ridership at a faster rate. In Minneapolis/St-Paul, the proportion of college-educated residents is linked to ridership gain. The sign and significance of these results remain consistent even when controlling for intra-urban migration. Although bus ridership is declining across neighborhood characteristics, these results suggest that the underlying cause of bus ridership decline must be primarily affecting the travel behavior of white bus riders.",0965-8564,Not found
Towards welfare optimal operation of innovative mobility concepts: External cost pricing in a world of shared autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.032,136,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Autonomous vehicles (AV) create new opportunities to traffic planners and policy-makers. In the case of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs), dynamic pricing, vehicle routing and dispatch strategies may aim for the maximization of the overall system welfare instead of the operator’s profit. In this study, an existing congestion pricing methodology is applied to the SAV transport mode. On the SAV operator’s side, the routing- and dispatch-relevant cost are extended by the time and link-specific congestion charge. On the users’ side, the congestion costs are added to the fare. Simulation experiments are carried out for Berlin, Germany in order to investigate the impact of SAVs and different pricing setups on the transport system. For the pricing setup, where SAV users only pay the base fare and there is no congestion charge added to the user costs, the model predicts an SAV share of 17.7% within the inner-city Berlin service area. The level of traffic congestion increases, air pollution levels decrease and noise levels slightly increase in the inner-city area. The SAV congestion charge pushes users from SAVs to the walk, bicycle and conventional (driver-controlled) private car (CC) mode. The latter effect is avoided by applying the same congestion charge also to CC users. Overall, this study highlights the importance to control both, the SAV and CC mode in order to improve a city’s transport system.",0965-8564,Not found

This manuscript presents an assessment of urban road freight in the MRSP based on primary metrics carried out by the Municipality’s survey in 2016 on light- and heavy-duty vehicles (LDVs and HDVs). Origin (O) and destination (D) freight activity indicators provide a baseline for assessing trends in efficiency and operational performance. These descriptive (DIs) and key performance indicators (KPIs) come directly and indirectly from the O and D company vehicle survey and identify space and temporal distributions of main freight transport sources by vehicle and commodity types. This paper addresses the need to use the vehicle survey to understand road freight activity and transportation in MRSP and with successive editions of the freight survey it will be possible to track the development of the commodity’s transport content to reveal a chronological development in freight logistics and emissions. As the metropolitan region sprawls, it is important to track these metrics in order to define and evaluate sound measures and policies to improve life and air quality. Assumptions and analyses of freight road transport in São Paulo find significant new perspectives to handle several issues in order to assess and improve vehicle utilization, fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions in future over time. This research has potential significant impact in other Latin American cities and the results can be extrapolated to other local freight inventories and be used to provide freight metrics to be included in Brazil’s National Determined Commitments (NDC).",0965-8564,Not found
Revisiting the foundations of fare evasion research,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.004,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"In 1986 the author wrote a paper about tax compliance that theorized that the output of tax inspectors would be constrained by the rate of evasion of tax payments. That paper was never subsequently cited in the literature on transit fare evasion, which presumed that ticket inspection had a simple unidirectional effect on evasion. This current paper argues that all subsequent models of the economic link between fare evasion and ticket inspection overlook the possibility of a bidirectional relationship between the two. The 1986 paper further argued that multiple equilibrium levels of evasion versus inspection might be found to exist, and that evasion could therefore possibly theoretically be tipped from one level to another. This current paper suggests that the periodic concentrated deployment of inspectors might be a novel enforcement strategy that takes advantage of this phenomenon.

Bus is often used to evacuate car-free people due to its large capacity and manageability. To improve the efficiency and practicality of public transport evacuation plans, this paper presents a round-trip bus evacuation model based on unfixed routes with simultaneous optimization of bus scheduling and routing planning. With constraints of bus capacity, evacuee demand at pick-up points, time windows and flow balance, the proposed model aims to reduce the total evacuee time cost, including in-bus travel time and waiting time. Moreover, a two-layer algorithm, integrating the insertion algorithm and the edge-exchange algorithm, is devised to obtain the model sub-optimal solution. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution, two cases are presented in this paper. In the first case, the proposed model and algorithm manage to solve bus evacuation problems effectively.

Walking as a service – Does it have legs?,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.015,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Amidst the hype and prospects offered by technological innovation for shaping the future of mobility, it can be easy to overlook the humble and enduring place and potential of walking as a means of movement in our mobility system. Yet walking may already be part of the change taking place, as technological innovation and behaviour come together. This paper considers the potential significance of pedestrian navigation that has been placed in the hands of smartphone users, referring to it as ‘Walking as a Service’ (WaaS). For individuals physically able to, walking can provide a number of positive attributes including independence, reliability, flexibility, exercise and affordability. Such attributes may compare favourably with other means of transport for shorter journeys. Yet in spite of this it is often not the mode of choice. One of its limitations can be the cognitive challenge – when faced with the unfamiliar - of judging how long a journey could take on foot and determining how to navigate to the destination. Google Maps Navigation now addresses this with what appears to be ever improving attention to usability. Audio-visual assistance ‘holds your hand’ on your journey and keeps track of how far you have left to go and the estimated time needed. With a focus on the UK, the paper explores the prospects for, and place of, WaaS in the future of mobility, also highlighting an apparent sharp increase in average walking trip rate from 2015 to 2018.

It is therefore important to ensure that people are not excluded from high-speed railway use due to relatively high ticket prices. We aim to develop a railway timetable according to passenger requirements that explicitly considers social equity by applying variable ticket prices to trains. Specifically, we want to optimize ticket prices for trains operating during off-peak hours to improve accessibility for low-income passengers to improve social justice. A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to solve our problem. In this timetabling-based model, we not only minimize the total general travel cost from a passenger perspective but also ensure that the revenue of the train company is no less than a specified value and that social equity is maintained at a specific level. To do this, we consider the social equity constraint and the minimum revenue requirement constraint, in addition to the traditional passenger-centric (-oriented) train timetabling-related constraints. Finally, we test our model on both a hypothetical high-speed railway network and the Guangzhou–Nanning and Guangzhou–Guilin high-speed railway network in China. The results demonstrate that the proposed optimization framework can provide a convenient timetable for passengers, adequate revenue for train companies and enhance social equity to meet government targets.",0965-8564,Not found

The rationale of the paper is that productivity assessment of Norwegian seaports is scarce in the literature, and studies of convergence/divergence in container seaports are missing in the literature on transportation. The methodology used is the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA)-based Malmquist productivity index ( MPI ) to assess productivity. To infer productivity convergence/divergence over the years, Beta (Β) and Sigma (Γ) types of convergence/divergence are used. The data used are for the 2002–2014 period and include comparable container seaports from the Nordic countries and the UK to increase the discriminatory power in the analyses and to compare the Norwegian container seaports with their peers. The results attest that (i) there has been annual average total productivity improvement across seaports of approximately 9.7%, (ii) the productivity improvement observed has been due to improvement in pure efficiency change of approximately 11% and scale efficiency improvement of approximately 3.2% and a decrease in technical change of approximately 3.2% annually, (iii) Norwegian seaports are also experiencing productivity improvement and are best performers with regard to scale efficiency change, and (iv) there is an indication of convergence among seaports with respect to all productivity indices, suggesting that seaports with initially lower productivity indices progress faster than those with initially higher indices.

An online survey was distributed to a panel of Edmonton, Canada, residents to this effect, and the use of video clips rather than descriptions is tested as a means to assess comfort on different types of cycling infrastructure. Cluster Correspondence Analysis is used to carry out the segmentations, including variables of comfort, cycling intent, and cycling in the previous summer. The survey sample tends to segment into three categories, as opposed to the four suggested by Geller: Uncomfortable or Uninterested, Cautious Majority, and Very Comfortable Cyclists. The Four Types of Cyclists typology is also shown to generate heterogeneous comfort patterns within each cyclist type, a limitation our empirically-derived segmentations overcome.",0965-8564,Not found
Analysing travel mode and airline choice using latent class modelling: A case study in Western Australia,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.020,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"This paper investigates travel mode and airline choice using stated-preference data. Both air and non-air passengers’ data were collected in Western Australia, which allows easier generalisability of the findings to a wider population. A market segmentation approach, using latent class modelling, was applied to identify passenger segments. The results shown a significant difference between identified segments in terms of demographics, economics and trip characteristics. One segment, comprising travellers with higher income and more frequent business travellers, was sensitive to service-factors. The other, comprising personal travellers with lower incomes, placed higher sensitivity on price. The findings highlight the importance of understanding mode choice behaviour based on market segmentation and provides insights to policy-makers and airlines for developing more effective polices and strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
On the modal shift from motorway to high-speed rail: evidence from Italy,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.006,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The development of high-speed rail (HSR) has had a notable impact on modal market shares on the routes on which its services have been implemented. The aim of this study is to analyse whether the HSR expansion in Italy has led to a modal shift from motorway to HSR. We empirically test i) whether HSR openings adjacent to motorway sectors have reduced the total km travelled by light vehicles on these sectors during the period 2001–2017; and ii) whether this reduction has been persistent or even more evident after the opening of on-track competition between two HSR operators. To do so, we carried out a generalized difference-in-differences estimation, using a unique panel dataset that exploits the heterogeneous traffic data within all tolled motorway sectors in a quasi-experimental setting. Our findings reveal that neither HSR openings nor the opening of on-track competition led to a modal shift from motorway to HSR services, as the two transport modes are non-competing. Conversely, HSR expansion had a slightly positive impact on motorway traffic. The extent to which HSR demand could be the result of a modal shift from motorways is a relevant issue in any cost-benefit analysis of HSR investments.",0965-8564,Not found
Valuation of transfer for bus users: The case of Gran Canaria,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.003,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"This paper analyses travelers’ preferences for the main attributes defining public bus transport services when evaluating connecting versus direct services in the island of Gran Canaria (Spain). The information is gathered through a Stated Preference experiment for bus users who make a transfer during their journey. In order to study the preference heterogeneity mixed logit and latent class models are estimated. The preference heterogeneity identified is different according to the estimated model. For Mixed Logit model, it is defined by type of transfer interacting with the transfer waiting time and for mandatory trips interacting with in-vehicle travel time. For Latent Class model, this preference heterogeneity is identified by three classes where the perception of the modal attributes is different in each class and non-compensatory behavior is identified. Moreover, the transfer waiting time is significant in all three classes. Thus, the results depend on the estimated model and a comparison is made with those results. The findings obtained seem to indicate that the improvement opportunities for transport systems should focus on the reduction in the transfer cost with the exception of individuals of class 2 and the improvement in the level-of-service.",0965-8564,Not found
Designing a large-scale public transport network using agent-based microsimulation,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.011,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"An agent-based simulation framework is extended to design efficient large-scale public transport networks. It goes beyond existing approaches by incorporating a dynamic demand response towards both changes in the network and exogenous factors. The framework is based on an agent-based (MATSim) simulation and tested for the city of Zurich. In contrast to most existing public transport network optimization approaches, this framework is part of a city-level, multi-modal transport simulation tool. Compared to the existing public transport system, it proposes a sparser network with smaller vehicles and substantially higher frequencies. By doing so, the approach predicts a higher transit ridership at a lower level of subsidies. Moreover, it reliably identifies corridors for potential capacity upgrades. The method may help transport planners to assess their existing public transport networks and to plan public transport infrastructure for the era of automated vehicles.",0965-8564,Not found
Identifying regional characteristics of transportation research with Transport Research International Documentation (TRID) data,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.005,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Since the planning and operations of transportation systems depend on factors ranging from economic to political, which tend to vary significantly over geographic regions (geoRegions), the following research question arises: do transportation topics in various geographic regions differ significantly? A review of existing transportation bibliographic studies shows that the information on the geographic location of study areas is seldom available and thus rarely analyzed. This study thus presents a geoRegion-topic model that extends a widely used topic model, latent Dirichlet allocation, to explore the region-specific characteristics of transportation research based on large-scale bibliographic data collected from Transport Research International Documentation. Top geographic regions that are frequently used as study areas in transportation research are identified at both the country/region and U.S. state levels. The results confirm that transportation research exhibits clear region-specific characteristics, namely each geographic region is associated with a unique transportation topic distribution. After exploring the relation between topic similarity and geographic proximity, we find in general countries/regions that are geographically proximate have quite similar transportation topic distributions, while this correlation cannot be observed at the U.S. state level. Other relevant findings are also reported, along with potential bias in the analysis.",0965-8564,Not found

Multiple dimensions of the models include the transportation mode, performance measures, improvement type, geographic regions, policy criteria, and time.

Drivers’ preferences for electric cars in Italy. Evidence from a country with limited but growing electric car uptake,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.004,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"So far, Italy has shown a much lower electric vehicle (EV) adoption rate than other European countries. In an effort to understand the motivations for the limited but growing EV uptake, this paper focuses on Italian drivers’ preferences resulting from a stated preference survey carried out in October-December 2018. This paper complements the international literature and updates previous Italian surveys administered by the authors in the past years (Valeri and Danielis, 2015; Giansoldati et al., 2018). The econometric analysis of the stated choices confirms that the vehicle attributes such as purchase price, fuel economy, and driving range play a very relevant role. The time spent to charge the vehicle affects negatively the respondents’ utility, while the fast charging network density is not yet perceived as significant or carries a counter-intuitive sign. On the contrary, the possibility to park EVs for free, even for a limited time, in the city central areas is positively valued by the respondents. Comparing our estimates with previous Italian studies, in particular with Giansoldati et al. (2018) who uses a similar questionnaire but on an earlier and more limited sample, there are hints of a change in the perception of the Italian drivers towards EVs. A noticeable difference is the value of the EV alternative specific constant. Giansoldati et al. (2018) find a negative value while this study finds a positive one. A second finding is that the willingness to pay for an additional driving range kilometre is lower than that previously found, indicating that Italian drivers are becoming more confident on EV driving range. Scenario analysis indicates that in Italy financial incentives would have a larger impact on the probability of buying an EV than technological improvements.",0965-8564,Not found
Effect of on-street parking pricing policies on parking characteristics: A case study of Nanning,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.003,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Parking pricing is considered a powerful tool for improving parking management and relieving traffic congestion in metropolitan areas. This study uses field-collected panel data over four time periods before and after the implementation of a new parking pricing policy in Nanning to investigate the time-varying effect of pricing on on-street parking characteristics, including parking duration and parking turnover. Results show that parking duration decreases as parking price increases, with the relationship presenting a growing elasticity. The elasticity of parking turnover fluctuates due perhaps to the influence of vehicle ownership. Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) tests show that on-street parking characteristics differ significantly before and after the implementation of a new parking pricing structure. Strategies that can improve parking services are also investigated based on the empirical data and modeling results.",0965-8564,Not found
Tradable permits to manage urban mobility: Market design and experimental implementation,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.008,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Congestion levels remain a substantial challenge, while the traditional economic response to congestion – road pricing – remains politically infeasible in most locations. Tradable permits are likely to be a more viable alternative, because they do not require a net financial flow from road users to the government. It is therefore the right moment to design and empirically test tradable permit schemes for managing urban mobility. This paper presents and empirically tests a complete design of a market for tradable permits, both in terms of the conceptual set-up of the market as well as its technical implementation. The design is evaluated against a number of criteria, including: transparency and containment of transaction costs, stability of permit prices in relation to the dynamic equilibrium on the mobility market and the prevention of undesirable speculation and fraud. We present evidence of the empirical functioning of this market, using the results of a conducted lab-in-the-field experiment with virtual mobility behaviour and real financial incentives.",0965-8564,Not found
Modeling incentive strategies for landside integration in multimodal transport chains,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.012,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"A significant bottleneck in port regionalization through multimodal transport chains is expensive and time-consuming inland transport. To be competitive, it is crucial for a port authority to build an effective transport system and develop collection-distribution abilities. Considering shipper preferences, this study proposes a pricing model to describe the markets of competing seaports and discusses several incentive strategies that may or may not bring mutual benefits for shippers and port authorities in the multimodal transport chain, such as the corridor investment strategy, subsidy strategy, and combinational strategy. Based on two adjacent ports in China, a comparative analysis is carried out for evaluating the effects of different strategies. The results show that the corridor investment strategy depends on unit investment capital for improving transport convenience. It is necessary to adopt a differentiated subsidy strategy based on transport distance when considering the subsidy strategy; however, there is a constraint on the subsidy level. In the combinational strategy, shippers’ preferences for transport convenience and low inland transport cost have a significant impact on a port authority’s total revenue.",0965-8564,Not found

Shortest hyperpaths in a multimodal hypergraph with real-time information on some transit lines,10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.020,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"This paper presents an algorithm to find multimodal shortest hyperpaths in a transport system where transit arrival is random (i.e. random-arrival transit system), while real-time information on vehicle arrivals is only available for some lines and modes. When the algorithm is queried, there is a short horizon where real-time information is accurate, and past this the most reliable information for estimating the arrivals is to use a random distribution specific to the lines. This problem occurs frequently in emerging cities where the transit schedules are not maintained. A Combined Real-Time Hypergraph is constructed to model the multimodal transport system where all the public transport modes have random arrivals and real-time information on arrivals is available for some lines of some modes. In order to model the period of time when some lines have real-time information, the composition of the head nodes of hyperarcs changes over time. The algorithm is tested on a real-life transport system where we change the number of lines with available real-time information to assess the performance of the algorithm in different scenarios. We found that incrementing the number of lines with real-time information does not impact the performance.",0965-8564,Not found
Bicycle superhighway: An environmentally sustainable policy for urban transport,10.1016/j.tra.2019.06.015,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Bicycle is a sustainable low-carbon transport mode. However, insufficient or unplanned infrastructure leads to decrease in the share of bicycle in many cities of developing nations. In order to increase the bicycle share and to provide safer, faster and more direct routes, a bicycle superhighway is proposed for urban areas. This study identifies the potential of increase in the bicycle share. For maximum utilization of the new infrastructure, an algorithm is presented to identify the optimum number and locations of the connectors between proposed new infrastructure and existing network. Household income levels are incorporated into the decision making process of individual travellers for a better understanding of the modal shift. A real-world case study of Patna, India is chosen to show the application of the proposed superhighway. It is shown that for Patna, the bicycle share can escalate as high as 48% up from 32% by providing this kind of infrastructure. However, together with bicycles, allowing motorbikes on the superhighway limits the bicycle share to 44%. The increase in bicycle share is mainly a result of people switching from motorbike, public transport and walk to the bicycle. Further, to evaluate the benefits of the bicycle superhighway, this study first extends an emission modelling tool to estimate the time-dependent, vehicle-specific emissions under mixed traffic conditions. Allowing only bicyclists on the superhighway improves congested urban areas, reduces emissions, and increases accessibility. However, allowing motorbikes on the superhighway increases emissions significantly in the central part of the urban area and reduces accessibilities by bicycle mode to education facilities which are undesirable. This study elicits that a physically segregated high-quality bicycle superhighway will not only attract current non-cyclist travellers and increase the share of the bicycle mode, but will also reduce negative transport externalities significantly.",0965-8564,Not found

This manuscript outlines a conjoint framework where various factors affecting sustainability and competitiveness of UCMs are identified through observation study and organized using PESTLE qualitative framework. Afterwards, it presents an AHP-TOPSIS based qualitative approach where inputs from experts as well as major stakeholders (owners/operators, drivers, conductors and passengers) are combined based on the PESTLE framework to fathom the competitiveness of UCMs. Along this process, the manuscript also unveils the business model of UCMs along with their area of operation, advantages and weaknesses. For this, the study uses Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh as study area and selects three popular UCMs – locally known as Rickshaw, Easy bike and Leguna. The findings suggest that economic, social and political factors respectively have the highest influence among all factors of PESTLE. Rickshaw was found to be the most competitive followed by Easy bike and Leguna. The study is expected to shed light into the perception and expectation of major stakeholders of UCMs which in turn will provide valuable insight for designing conventional public transport services, and/or, help in slowly integrating the UCMs into the mainstream transportation service through addressing their shortcomings.",0965-8564,Not found

This is followed by purchase subsidies, to narrow the difference in price of an EV and that of an internal combustion engine vehicle, with 68% of respondents stating that they have a strong or at least a partial positive impact. Pilot/trial/demonstrations of EVs, to expose potential buyers to EVs, are also perceived to have a positive effect, with 66% of respondents stating so. Tax incentives, which like purchase subsidies, narrow the gap between the total operating cost of an EV and that of a conventional vehicle, are also perceived to have a positive impact by 65% of respondents.

Surrogate-based optimization for multi-objective toll design problems,10.1016/j.tra.2018.11.014,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The toll design problem (TDP) provides a quantitative approach to the design of road pricing schemes. Its practical use, however, can be computationally challenging if the formulated TDP requires time-consuming computer models to evaluate candidate designs, especially if such designs must account for multiple objectives. For TDPs to be of practical relevance to the real-world planning of sustainable transportation networks, efficient TDP solution heuristics must be developed. To this end, two surrogate-based solution heuristics for multi-objective TDPs are proposed in this paper. Surrogate-based optimization uses simple approximations to computationally expensive models in order to accelerate the discovery of good solutions. The general search strategy of the proposed heuristics is as follows. In each iteration of the heuristics, a pool of candidate pricing schemes with unique sets of tolling locations and associated tolling levels is generated. From this pool of designs, the heuristics use the surrogate models to screen for solutions that are expected to be nondominated and that meet a specified selection criterion. Then, these promising designs are evaluated by the computationally expensive models, and the outputs obtained from these evaluations are used to update the surrogate models. Both heuristics repeat this general process until a maximum number of iterations are completed, at which point the best TDP solutions are returned. In addition to the solution heuristics, this paper presents a transportation network paradox that highlights how transportation network interventions intended to reduce traffic emissions could have unintended effects on a population’s exposure to pollutants. The paradox also is used to illustrate the practical complexity of accounting for environmental inequality objectives, as well as the relevance of multi-objective analysis approaches to transportation planning. Formulations of multi-objective TDPs that consider both travel and pollutant exposure-related objectives are also presented, including the objectives of reducing human intake of vehicle-generated air pollutants and of minimizing environmental inequality. The Sioux Falls and Chicago Sketch networks were used in tests that examined the relative performance of the heuristics, as well as the characteristics of pricing configurations obtained under different budget constraints. Among other results, the tests show that a pricing configuration could decrease total pollutant intake and environmental inequality, while at the same time producing an increase in pollutant concentrations in a significant number of pollutant receptor points.",0965-8564,Not found
Classifying the traffic state of urban expressways: A machine-learning approach,10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.035,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The classification of the urban traffic state and its application is an important part of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which can not only help traffic managers grasp the traffic operation situation and analyze congestion, but also provide travelers with more traffic information and help them avoid congestion. Thus, an accurate traffic state classification method would be very practical for urban traffic management. The primary objective of this study is to classify the urban traffic state using a machine-learning method (i.e., the FCM clustering method, and the classification results can be determined from the corresponding clustering labels). In this approach, two parts are developed. First, a new classification indicator, i.e., the ample degree of road network is proposed, and it will make up a comprehensive classification indicator system with other parameters such as traffic flow, speed and occupancy. Then, the traditional fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering approach is improved in two regards, i.e., the fuzzy membership function improvement and weighting processing of the samples, and these improvements can enhance the clustering performance. As a result, an improved machine-learning method (i.e., the improved FCM clustering approach) is developed and used to conduct the clustering analysis with real-world traffic flow data. Next, a case study of Shanghai is used to guide the study process, which consists of data processing, clustering analysis and method comparison. The other methods (e.g., the support vector machines (SVM) method, the decision tree method, the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method and the traditional FCM clustering approach) are introduced to compare with the improved FCM clustering approach. The discussion shows the superiority of the proposed method (e.g., compared with the traditional FCM clustering approach, the objective function value of the improved method decreased by 31.11%, and cluster center error also show a descending trend), and it outperforms the other methods in classification performance (e.g., the overall classification accuracy of the improved FCM method increased by 10.10%, 5.45%, 30.92% and 35.66% in comparison with the traditional FCM method, SVM method, decision tree method and KNN method, respectively). Additionally, the NMI, ROC curve results also illustrated the superiority of the improved FCM method to other methods.

Combination of tradable credit scheme and link capacity improvement to balance economic growth and environmental management in sustainable-oriented transport development: A bi-objective bi-level programming approach,10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.031,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"In this paper, we propose a bi-objective bi-level programming model to balance economic growth and environmental management, which orients sustainable transport development by combining a tradable credit scheme (TCS) and a link capacity improvement measure.

The lower level is the user equilibrium problem, with elastic origin-destination (O-D) demand given the TCS and link capacity expansion measure.

Our research focuses on the question whether e-mobility product service systems (i.e. plug-in electric vehicles, interconnected charging infrastructure as well as charging platform and additional services) are supportive to plug-in electric vehicle adoption in professional environments. Our user oriented techno-economic analysis of costs and benefits is based on empirical data originating from 109 organizational fleets participating in a field trial in south-west Germany with in total 327 plug-in electric vehicles and 181 charging points. The results show that organizations indicate a high willingness to pay for e-mobility product service systems. Organizations encounter non-monetary benefits, which on average overcompensate the current higher total cost of ownership of plug-in electric vehicles compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. However, the willingness to pay for e-mobility charging infrastructure and services alone is currently not sufficient to cover corresponding actual costs.

Correcting for endogeneity due to omitted crowding in public transport choice using the Multiple Indicator Solution (MIS) method,10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.030,137,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Crowding levels are very relevant for the analysis and evaluation of the performance of public transport as they strongly affect the level of service and the overall perceived quality of the system. However, crowding is not an easy variable to measure and, hence, demand models often tend to ignore or use abstract proxies for it. In this paper, we assess the Multiple Indicator Solution (MIS) method in a Stated Preference (SP) experiment where crowding conditions were displayed to the respondent but are artificially omitted in the estimation of a curtailed model to cause endogeneity. Results provide evidence that the MIS method can be used to control for a wide range of omitted attributes in SP data. We also discuss the potential application of this approach to Revealed Preferences (RP) models of public transport by asking suitable post-trip questions to users. Two MIS variations were applied to this SP case study and both provided outcomes that were superior to those of the curtailed model. We enrich the analysis with the aid of Monte Carlo simulation. Results suggest that potential problems may arise in the presence of neglected interactions and if indicators are only weakly correlated with the omitted attribute. For the SP case study analysed, only the former issue seems to play a role in the results. The article finishes by discussing the implications of these findings for the correction of endogeneity on SP and RP data on public transport and suggesting future lines of research in this area.",0965-8564,Not found

Even incorrect weather forecasts can impact on bike ridership, which underlines the importance of weather forecast effects for traffic planners; for example, forecasted rain can reduce bike traffic by 3.6% in periods that turn out to be rain-free. Additionally, a digital image-processing method is used to calculate the darkness of the cloud coverage displayed on weather forecast maps. The results imply that bike ridership is significantly smaller in regions with darker forecasted clouds. It is also shown that weather forecasts have a stronger impact on recreational bike traffic than on utilitarian traffic. Furthermore, various lagging and leading effects of rain forecasts are outlined. Morning rain forecasts can, for example, reduce bike ridership in midday and afternoon hours that were predicted to be rain-free. To derive these results, hourly bicycle counts from 188 automated counting stations in Germany are collected for the years 2017 and 2018. They are linked to actual weather data from Germany’s National Meteorological Service and with historical weather forecasts that are deduced from weather maps of Germany’s most-watched television news program. Log-linear and negative binomial regression models are then used to estimate the weather forecast effects.",0965-8564,Not found
Passenger opinions of the perceived safety and interaction with automated shuttles: A test ride study with ‘hidden’ safety steward,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.009,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"A necessary condition for the effective integration of automated vehicles in our daily lives is their acceptance by passengers inside and pedestrians and cyclists outside the automated vehicle. 119 respondents experienced an automated shuttle ride with a ‘hidden steward on board’ in a mixed traffic environment in Berlin-Schöneberg. A mixed-method approach was applied gathering qualitative interview data during the ride and quantitative questionnaire data after the ride. Responses were classified into three main categories: (1) Perceived safety, (2) interactions with automated shuttles in crossing situations, and (3) communication with automated shuttles. Respondents associated their perceptions of safety with the low speed, dynamic object and event identification, longitudinal and lateral control, pressing the emergency button inside the shuttle, their general trust in technology, sharing the shuttle with fellow travellers, the operation of the shuttle in a controlled environment, and the behaviour of other road users outside the shuttle. Respondents pressed the emergency button inside the automated shuttle on 28 out of 62 test rides in order to test its behavior. They further expected to be more cautious in crossing the road before an automated shuttle due to the lack of eye contact with the human driver and a lack of trust in the behavior of the automated shuttle, and expected road users testing the automated shuttle due to the conservative driving behavior of automated shuttles. We recommend future research into the hypothesis that the acceptance of automated shuttles will be associated with the perceived safety of and their effective and intuitive interaction and communication with both passengers and other road users.",0965-8564,Not found
Transitioning towards the deployment of line-based autonomous buses: Consequences for service frequency and vehicle capacity,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.019,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The deployment of autonomous buses (AB) is expected to have consequences for service design facilitated by its cost function structure. We study the impacts of AB deployment in line-based public transport (PT) systems. In particular, we examine the transition phase where AB is sequentially deployed, involving the selection of lines for which AB will be introduced. To this end, we develop a modeling framework using a dynamic public transportation assignment and operations simulation model that captures users’ adaptive path choices. An analytical model is used to determine the initial solutions in terms of service frequency and vehicle capacity for the simulation framework. Due to their different cost function structures, the deployment of AB may be accompanied by changes in the service frequency and vehicle capacity settings and consequently also on passenger flow distribution across the network. Both the simultaneous and the sequential deployment of AB on multiple lines are investigated. Deployment solutions are assessed in terms of the both total operator and user cost. The decision variables are vehicle capacity per line, service frequency per line and vehicle technology per line - i.e. either manually driven or fully automated buses. The framework is applied to a case study in Kista, Stockholm. The study shows that AB service have the potential to attract passengers through improved service provision. A sensitivity analysis is carried out concerning the effects of different cost parameters and demand levels on the deployment of AB in fixed line operations.",0965-8564,Not found
Travel and cognitive dissonance,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.014,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"In this review paper, we reconceptualise the relationships between travel-related attitudes and behaviours using (and considering the applicability of) Festinger’s cognitive dissonance theory. According to this psychological theory – developed in the 1950s and widely used ever since − a dissonance between attitudes and behaviour can result in feelings of discomfort, which people will try to reduce by changing either their attitudes or their behaviour. In our interpretation, we focus on two interrelated decision processes linked with travel behaviour, i.e., travel mode choice and residential location choice. Although a considerable number of travel behaviour studies refer to the cognitive dissonance theory in order to explain found results (e.g., changed attitudes), a full examination of the process of cognitive dissonance (reduction) in the travel behaviour literature is currently lacking. Through this critical consolidation of transport literature on the cognitive dissonance topic, we propose future research directions to fill this gap. We argue that the cognitive dissonance theory can provide valuable insights into satisfaction levels with travel and the place of residence, while also helping to explain changes in travel-related attitudes and choices of where to live and which travel mode to use.",0965-8564,Not found
Scheduling synchronization in urban rail transit networks: Trade-offs between transfer passenger and last train operation,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.008,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The scheduling synchronization problem in this paper is to obtain an optimal schedule by optimizing running time, departure time, dwell time and arrival time of the last train in urban rail transit networks. Operators are often faced with multiple conflicting requirements simultaneously such as high passenger’s service quality and less cost, smooth transfer events and less passenger’s travel time, and high accessibility and less operation time. Thus, researchers in this industry concentrate on utilizing operations and management decisions to solve the scheduling problem while balancing the service trade-offs. In this paper, we formulate a mixed integer programming approach for the last train schedule planning, and passengers benefit from smoother transfer in the form of maximizing the transfer synchronization events, while operators simultaneously can benefit with lower operation costs by minimizing the worst big difference between last trains. We propose an improved non-dominated sorting approach embedded in a genetic algorithm to obtain close-to-optimal solutions in a much shorter time for a sophisticated, real-world and large-scale Beijing subway network. Results demonstrate that significant service performance gains (76.33% for Just-missed, 32.01% for successful transfer, 15.39% for non-equity for last trains and 45.25% for variance indicators, etc.), which indicate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling framework and solution algorithm. The operator formulates an efficient schedule for the actual operation of the urban rail transit network by the proposed application method, and it also would be applicable to solving schedule problems among a large-scale network in other industries.",0965-8564,Not found
The effectiveness of decarbonizing the passenger transport sector through monetary incentives,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.020,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Passenger cars account for most road transportation emissions, and almost half of overall transport sector emissions in the EU. Countries in Europe have established policies to achieve emissions reductions in the transport sector by incentivizing the acquisition of fuel-efficient vehicles. In this paper, we perform a pair-wise comparison of common passenger vehicles sold in 2017, which implements newer data and more realistic assumptions than an earlier study. The pair-wise study compares an electric vehicle (EV) against a similar combustion vehicle to simulate a real market choice for consumers—a method commonly used to elicit preferences—and shows that fiscal incentives are effective at increasing EV acquisition. Acquiring EVs over conventional vehicles alone contributes to about a 60% reduction per kilometer of well-to-wheel emissions, based on average emissions of new EU vehicle fleets in 2017. A second mechanism at reducing emissions in the transport sector is through incentivizing consumer charging behavior to use less carbon intense electricity. The electricity used to charge EVs is variable throughout a day; therefore, we propose a dynamic pricing mechanism dependent on the carbon intensity of the electricity grid. We do this analysis through a case study for Portugal using the entire country’s public charging demands from 2017. The responsiveness of the users to the variable price is reflected by the market price elasticity of demand, and the resulting reduction in demand from the surcharge is approximated. Our study finds that a surcharging mechanism based on the carbon intensity of the electric grid can yield an emissions reduction of 20 tonnes per year while still achieving profits.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact of high-speed rail on social equity in China: Evidence from a mode choice survey,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.018,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This paper investigates two fundamental questions related to the social impact of high-speed rail (HSR): (1) does the development of HSR infrastructure lead to the exclusion of certain social groups? and (2) what factors exclude certain users from using HSR? Based on a comprehensive survey of 4,924 passengers who chose conventional rail services in China, both binary and multinomial logit analyses were conducted to examine to what extent the mode choice of passengers who departed from Chongqing was affected by various factors, including socioeconomic and train service conditions. The analyses reveal that factors such as fare, travel habits, trip distance, and onboard amenities play significant roles in whether passengers choose conventional rail over HSR. Conversely, the study shows that lower incomes and education levels are associated with higher odds of choosing conventional trains over HSR by 24.1% and 25.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the study shows that the preference of conventional rail to HSR varies among different regions in China. In particular, people were found to prefer less to choose conventional trains in the west and central regions than the east region when the HSR service becomes available. Such a pattern suggests that HSR as a new mode of intercity travel, has become a preferred mode for many people, even for those in the less developed regions in China. However, some passengers from less developed western provinces were also found to have a stronger sense of being excluded from using HSR, given the concerns of high fares and personal perception of cities that the system serves. Overall, this study provides important implications for planning and policy-making to achieve sustainable operations and the development of the passenger rail system.",0965-8564,Not found
Estimating the housing capitalization effects of new infrastructure: Should we be using rents instead of prices?,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.016,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"A widely used approach to valuing transport infrastructure is to look at its effects on housing prices, in treated vs control regions, before and after it is built. But anticipation effects mean that housing prices may start changing as soon as a project is announced. This creates complications for an analysis of the capitalization effects on prices. A long span of data is potentially required—because the time from a project’s announcement to completion may be many years—and the assumption of common price trends between the treated and control regions must be maintained over this time span. An alternative approach is to use rents. This may be advantageous as rents are more directly related to the infrastructure’s service-flow. Though account needs to be taken of the fact that those homes which are rented are often not representative of the housing stock as a whole. We investigate these issues for a new train line in Sydney and contrast the results from using both prices and rents.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper investigates two important prerequisites for bike sharing to fulfil these premises: Does it synergise rather than compete with current alternatives to car-based urban mobility; and is it inclusively accessible across population and spatial segments? Drawing on complete 2016–2017 trip records of the Oslo (Norway) bike sharing system, this paper analyses the potential use of bike sharing for accessing, egressing and interchanging public transport and explores its age and gender dimensions. Bike sharing ridership is substantially higher on routes that either start or end with metro/rail connectivity, whilst controlling for other factors, such as route distance, elevation, urban form, time of day and bike dock capacities. However, our results also reveal that bike sharing – both as a stand-alone system and in conjunction with public transport – is less accessible to, suited to, and used by women and older age groups. Especially gender biases appear profound, multifaceted, and intersected by spatial inequalities favouring central male-dominated employment areas. These findings are discussed to derive policy and design directions regarding multimodal integration, dock expansion, rental limitations, and the introduction of e-bikes, to improve the performance, multimodal integration, gender equality and overall socio-spatial inclusiveness of bike sharing.",0965-8564,Not found
Assessing the impacts of automated mobility-on-demand through agent-based simulation: A study of Singapore,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.004,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The advent of autonomous vehicle technologies and the emergence of new ride-sourcing business models has spurred interest in Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMOD) as a prospective solution to meet the challenges of urbanization. AMOD has the potential of providing a convenient, reliable and affordable mobility service through more competitive cost structures enabled by autonomy (relative to existing services) and more efficient centralized fleet operations. However, the short and medium-term impacts of AMOD are as yet uncertain. On the one hand, it has the potential to alleviate congestion through increased ride-sharing and reduced car-ownership, and by complementing mass-transit. Conversely, AMOD may in fact worsen congestion due to induced demand, the cannibalization of public transit shares, and an increase in Vehicle-Kilometers Traveled (VKT) because of rebalancing and empty trips. This study attempts to systematically examine the impacts of AMOD on transportation in Singapore through agent-based simulation, modeling demand, supply and their interactions explicitly. On the demand side, we utilize an activity-based model system, that draws on data from a smartphone-based stated preferences survey conducted in Singapore. On the supply side, we model the operations of the AMOD fleet (including the assignment of requests to vehicles and rebalancing), which are integrated within a multimodal mesoscopic traffic simulator. Comprehensive simulations are conducted using a model of Singapore for the year 2030 and yield insights into the impacts of AMOD in dense transit-dependent cities from the perspective of the transportation planner, fleet operator, and user. The findings suggest that an unregulated introduction of AMOD can cause significant increases in network congestion and VKT, and have important policy implications that could potentially inform future deployments of AMOD.",0965-8564,Not found
Does China's high-speed rail development lead to regional disparities? A network perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.010,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This research examines whether cities are getting more equally accessible and connected via high-speed rail (HSR) in China over the period from 2010 to 2015. Existing studies mainly use network centralities to describe the spatial pattern of HSR network without measuring the spatial disparity of these centralities, and most of them rely on the infrastructure network and thus fail to incorporate HSR service quality in the centrality measures. Using HSR timetable data, we incorporate both scheduled travel time and daily frequency of each origin-destination city pair into three centrality measures and further quantify their inequalities using Theil’s T index. We find that as the HSR network expands, cities appear to be more equal in terms of accessibility, but their disparities in connectivity and transitivity depend on the dimensions of comparison. In general, although the difference between economic regions or between megalopolises has reduced, small/medium-sized cities not belonging to any major city cluster are further lagged behind in HSR development. The difference between core and non-core cities in the same megalopolises has decreased despite that non-core cities are increasingly relying on core cities to access other regions.",0965-8564,Not found

Examining the impact of car-sharing on private vehicle ownership,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.003,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Car-sharing has experienced a significant boom in recent years, with estimates suggesting that car-sharing programs are now operating in over 30 countries worldwide, serving around five million users. The potential to reduce individual vehicle ownership rates is frequently cited as a motive for promoting car-sharing. While some previous studies have argued that customers are indeed willing to reduce the total number of vehicles owned after becoming car-sharing members, the reliability of these findings is tenuous given that many are based on self-selected samples of car-sharing users, resulting in biased estimates. In theory, the availability of car-sharing programs could have limited effect on the general public’s car ownership decisions–or at least have no effect on a large portion of travelers. Whether or not traveler decision processes are significantly influenced by specific attributes of different car-sharing options (e.g., access time, vehicle size, fuel type, etc.) remains an unanswered question, as there are limited quantitative studies on this issue. To contribute to filling this research gap, this paper discusses the findings of a study of 1,500 private households across major Australian cities. A nested logit model is used to investigate the impacts of car-sharing on respondents’ household vehicle ownership decisions. In contrast to the results of some previous studies, we find that the stated availability of car-sharing appears to have minimal impact on respondents’ decision to own a vehicle or not, leading to important policy implications. We agree with prior investigations that car-sharing could potentially reduce private car ownership. However, because this study finds limited impact of the availability of car-sharing on vehicle ownership, and because the majority of respondents did not self-identify as car-sharing users, education and awareness campaigns could be important factors in improving the general public’s preferences towards car-sharing and fully realizing car-sharing’s benefits to society.",0965-8564,Not found
A stakeholders perspective on improving barriers in implementation of public bicycle sharing system (PBSS),10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.007,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Public bicycle sharing system (PBSS) has been adopted around the globe to reduce traffic congestion, CO2 emissions and for positive health effects. The first system was initially started in the year 1965 at Amsterdam and now it has been expanded almost in all the continents of the globe. The adoption of this concept was initially seen in developed countries. Now in the past decade various developing countries also have implemented the PBSS in their urban areas. However, the developing countries are facing many implementations and less ridership issues due to various barriers. This paper identifies the barriers which are hinders in the way of implementation of PBSS. An identified 31 barrier was categorized under six groups for ranking. The Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) is applied to examine the relevance and prioritize them with the help of different stakeholders. Total 31 stakeholders were selected as experts from different working backgrounds for this study. The experts were grouped into six namely decision makers, academicians, consultants, scientists and researchers, operators, and users. The perspective of each group is also examined and checked using Kendall' coefficient. The majority of experts opine that City infrastructure barrier and travel characteristics barriers are most influential barriers for successful implementation of PBSS while technological and geographical barriers are least influential barriers. The overall results and opinions by different group of experts will help the decision makers to formulate effective policy to tackle all the barriers prior to implementation of PBSS in Indian urban areas.

"How comparable are origin-destination matrices estimated from automatic fare collection, origin-destination surveys and household travel survey? An empirical investigation in Lyon",10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.021,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Origin–destination (OD) matrices are one of the key elements in travel behaviour analysis. For decades, transportation researchers have mostly used data obtained by active solicitation such as surveys to construct these matrices but new data sources like automatic fare collection (AFC) are now available and can be used to measure OD flows. As a result, a more heterogeneous corpus of data sources is now available to estimate travel demand. However, little research examines how comparable the estimated demands may be. In this paper, three data sources namely a household travel survey, a large scale origin–destination survey and entry only automated fare collection are processed to derive typical weekday public transit OD trip matrices. Various elements of the resulting matrices are then compared. While all the matrices share some common characteristics, there are also substantial differences that must be addressed. AFC data is not error-free and needs to be supplemented with data from other sources to construct a representative OD trip matrix. This is because not all destinations can be inferred, the smart card penetration rate is far less than 100% and fare evasion cannot be ignored. Our empirical results suggest that scaling an AFC matrix with automated passenger counts may be a viable solution. The results also indicate that the household travel survey significantly underestimates the volume of public transit trips compared to the other sources. The findings of this research contribute to a better understanding of the available data sources for public transit demand estimation. They can help practitioners to improve the quality and accuracy of OD matrices.",0965-8564,Not found

Impact of speed limit changes and road characteristics",10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.024,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The estimation of the free flow speed (FFS) distribution is important for capacity analysis, determination of the level-of-service, and setting speed limits. Subjective time headway thresholds have been commonly used to identify vehicles travelling under free flow speed conditions i.e., vehicles whose speeds are not influenced by the vehicle in front. Since, the headway a driver operates under the free flow state is subjective and varies from driver to driver, such approaches can introduce biases in the FFS estimation. Therefore, in this paper a parametric probabilistic latent approach is proposed based on discrete choice utility theory to estimate the FFS distribution on urban roads and simultaneously the probability that drivers perceive their state as constrained by the vehicle in front. This methodology is used to estimate the impacts of road characteristics and Posted Speed Limit (PSL) changes on the FFS distribution using an extensive dataset of speed observations from urban roads with varying characteristics. The results show that the simultaneous estimation of the free flow speed distribution and the state the driver is in (e.g., free or constrained) is feasible. The analysis indicates that the FFS is influenced by several road characteristics such as land use, on-street parking and the presence of sidewalks. The PSL change impacts not only the distribution of the free flow vehicles but also the speed distribution of the constrained vehicles. The constrained probabilities vary depending on the PSL change with higher probabilities for lower speed limits.",0965-8564,Not found
Comparing social costs of public transport networks structured around an Open and Closed BRT corridor in medium sized cities,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.005,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) has proven to be an effective and affordable transportation option for large-sized cities. In these cities, BRT is usually considered an effective complement or substitute for rail-based systems, playing a key role in complex multimodal networks with several massive transport corridors. More recently, medium-sized cities of less than 200,000 inhabitants have also considering implementing BRT as a means of mass transit. These cities usually need only a few of these massive transport corridors (often just one), and they must decide how to structure their services. This report discusses which of the two types of BRT-based networks is best for the social interest in the case of medium-sized cities: (1) Closed BRT, in which buses operating inside and outside the corridor are separated and have different designs, or (2) Open BRT, in which the same buses operate inside and outside the corridor, entering and exiting at different points along a route. To answer this question two models with different levels of detail in terms of a city’s characteristics were developed to represent both agency and user costs. In the first model a classic idealized city approach is addressed, while in the second model the problem is solved for the specific geographic characteristics and constraints of a real city. The results based on both models show that when it is optimally configured, Closed BRT networks offer mid-sized cities higher frequencies and lower waiting times. However, these benefits do not offset the cost associated with higher number of transfers that Closed BRT networks require, as compared to Open BRT networks. Transfers not only affect users due to the transferring experience, but also end up making the entire system slower. Overall, Open BRT shows significantly less Total Costs than Closed BRT in most of the scenarios that were analyzed.",0965-8564,Not found

Based on statistical analysis and regression analysis, this study explores the factors that affect VOTs at the macro/micro level, and provide several suggestions to decrease errors in VOTs caused by inappropriate data collection and model construction. With regard to influencing factors, the volume of transported goods per capita was found to be a more appropriate variable than GDP per capita to explain the variation in VOT. With regard to data collection and model construction, ignoring reliability will risk overestimating VOT, and the model estimated by using stated preference data tends to yield lower VOTs than that using revealed preference data.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact of vehicle automation and electric propulsion on production costs for mobility services worldwide,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.021,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Automated driving technology along with electric propulsion are widely expected to fundamentally change our transport systems. They may not only allow a more productive use of travel time, but will likely trigger completely new business models in the mobility market. A key determinant of the future prospects of both existing and new mobility services will be their production costs. Hence, in this research the production costs of various transport modes both today and in an automated-electric future are analyzed. To account for different local contexts, the study is conducted for 17 cities across the globe. The results indicate that high-income countries will benefit the most from vehicle automation, while only smaller changes can be expected in lower-income countries. This is due to the different relative contribution of labor cost to the total cost of current taxi and bus operations. In a likely final state, transportation costs will be largely decoupled from a country’s income level, which will favor productivity in higher-income locations. While this research provides valuable first insights into potential future developments, the underlying assumptions will need to be updated as better information becomes available.",0965-8564,Not found

From an economics policy perspective, the recommendation would be to encourage the specialisation of ports where possible, and collaboration between ports with different specialisations, as well as those of smaller sizes. This would allow the development of strategic planning that favours coordination between ports, the joint development of infrastructure, and the avoidance of service duplication.

The results confirm the role of HSRs as a driving force in promoting local economic growth, although the spill-over effect is found to be insignificant.

By dividing the sample into small-medium cities and large-mega cities, as well as least-developed, developing, and developed cities, this study finds that HSRs make a significant positive contribution to economic growth in large-mega cities and developed cities but has insignificant effects in other cities. The results indicate that HSRs can widen economic disparity in China. Our findings not only advance the understanding of the role of HSRs in promoting China’s economic growth but also provide insights for planning future HSR networks. This study concludes that each city should reasonably plan its HSR network to promote economic growth and reduce economic disparity by accounting for different resource endowments, especially geographic and population factors.",0965-8564,Not found
Facility location and capacity planning considering policy preference and uncertain demand under the One Belt One Road initiative,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.012,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Due to its importance in integrating facilities and smoothing supply chain, facility location and capacity planning problem (FLCPP) is no doubt a key issue in constructing an efficient logistics and transportation network. One Belt and One Road (OBOR) initiative aims at reconstructing the logistics and transportation network along the trade corridors and improving the trade connectivity among the developing and developed countries. Nevertheless, under the OBOR initiative, FLCPP is greatly influenced by the government policy for regional development and the uncertain demand incurred by the enormous difference of economic form, custom and culture awareness among the involved countries. This study focuses on a special FLCPP under the OBOR initiative, in which the uncertainties of both policy preference and customer demand are considered simultaneously. To cope with these two categories of uncertainties, this study proposes a simulation-based optimization approach that includes the rough simulation and fine simulation methods. The former aims at finding a set of feasible decisions by using fuzzy and stochastic simulation, while the latter is used to achieve the best decision from the obtained feasible decisions by hybridizing the stochastic simulation with optimal computing budget allocation and mathematical programming. In order to demonstrate the application and advantage of the proposed approach, simulation experiments are conducted and experimental results show that this approach performs well in dealing with the concerned problem as well as some managerial insights and policy suggestions are obtained according to the analysis and results.",0965-8564,Not found
Willingness to ride and perceptions of autonomous public transit,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.010,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold great promise to contribute to global sustainability by expanding access to mobility. The introduction of autonomous buses and shuttles could be a turning point for public mobility in the USA, but how autonomous public transit is perceived remains largely unknown. To fill this gap, this study analyzes the willingness to use autonomous buses and shuttles based on two surveys conducted in Michigan. These surveys were a phone-based random-sampling survey of the general public and an on-board intercept survey of public transit riders. We found that autonomous buses might increase willingness to use public transit. 15% of people, who occasionally ride or do not ride public transit, embrace the idea of using autonomous bus service, while fixed-route riders were more likely to accept AVs than demand-response transit riders. However, about half of the public transit riders were hesitant about riding in autonomous buses citing concerns over safety, no human, and distrust in technology. Willingness to ride was higher among younger males than it was for females, seniors, and people with mobility disabilities. In addition, our data suggests that riders’ satisfaction with their drivers - be it skill, professionalism, or friendliness - had no impact on willingness to ride in AVs. As AVs become ready for deployment, policymakers and public transportation service providers should consider AV acceptance among vulnerable individuals to bring AV benefits to all.",0965-8564,Not found
Enhancing rail direct demand models with competition between ticket types using contributions from economic theory and market research,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.017,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Direct demand models estimated to ticket sales data have for many years provided evidence on how key variables influence rail demand in Great Britain. Nonetheless, there has been relatively little estimation of demand models disaggregated by ticket type which would provide own and cross-price elasticities that can inform the pricing of different ticket products. We here report such enhanced models estimated on large data sets and exploiting the relationships of economic theory within a demand system. In addition, a complementary market research exercise is undertaken that itself provides ticket specific own and cross-elasticities and which also supports the estimation of models jointly based on actual and stated behaviour. We conclude that the demand systems approach can recover robust ticket specific own-elasticities but that there are econometric difficulties in estimating cross-elasticities even using supporting economic theory, so that cross-elasticities between tickets are better deduced from these own-elasticities than estimated. This contrasts with the convention in the railway industry in Great Britain where own and cross-elasticities are deduced from recommended conditional elasticity evidence. Market research also has a role to play and provides own-elasticities that, as is common, are rather larger and cross-elasticities that are a little larger than those derived from ticket sales analysis. A key feature of this work is to reconcile those two approaches by scaling the market research elasticities using ticket sales data. This further supports our conclusion that generating robust own-elasticities and deducing cross-elasticities from these is currently the most fruitful method of obtaining a full set of own- and cross-elasticities for different ticket types within a demand system framework, and that this approach is superior to the conventional single equation approach.",0965-8564,Not found
A multi-criteria spatial evaluation framework to optimise the siting of freight consolidation facilities in inner-city areas,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.020,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Location analysis for a consolidation facility is a multi-criteria challenge, compounded by spatial constraints in real-world scenarios such as those found in inner-city areas. However, most decision support models in location studies of consolidation facilities are limited to numerical computation or multi-criteria analysis while ignoring spatial factors in location selection. This study aims to characterise suitable locations for an inner-city consolidation facility based on spatial aspects, operational requirements, and societal concerns. Accordingly, this study presents an integrated spatial multi-criteria location framework to identify and rank optimal sites for a proposed freight consolidation facility in an inner-city area using 11 decision criteria identified from key stakeholders. Real geographic data from Inner Melbourne, Australia, are used to identify 20 candidate sites which are then evaluated and ranked using the TOPSIS method. The suitability analysis confirms that the most suitable locations are in zones with affordable industrial land with excellent accessibility to major roads and goods receivers. Sensitivity analysis indicates that assigning more significance to the operational requirements and decreasing the priority weight for proximity to residential areas tip favourability towards areas with low real estate costs and more industrially-zoned parts. The multi-criteria spatial modelling allows decision-makers and transport researchers to apply value-decisions at the onset of the process, and it also allows for improved understanding and visualisation of the results and of the significance of the chosen criteria in the evaluation process.",0965-8564,Not found
Autonomous taxis &amp; public health: High cost or high opportunity cost?,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.011,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Passenger vehicles are a major source of air pollution, exposure to which increases respiratory disease risk, amplifies life-threatening conditions and burdens the public purse. The negative externalities associated with these vehicles rise further when road accidents are considered. Almost all such accidents involving fatalities transpire when private users are in single vehicle incidents or collide with each other. Though autonomous vehicle technology can mitigate these effects, widespread adoption and proliferation demands cost competitiveness with the status quo; namely, personally owned and operated, conventional vehicles. Here we show that this prospect may - in a commercially owned and operated enterprise – be unlikely. Causal factors of relevance include low capacity utilization rates and impracticable profit expectations. In a single ridership ‘autonomous taxi’ model, we find capacity utilization rates would need to improve from 52 percent to 100 percent and profits lowered by 37 percent (from 27 cents to 17 cents on a per-mile basis) for autonomous taxis to offer fares that are comparable with personally owned, conventional vehicles. In a multiple ridership model, the affordance of these fares requires a 30 percent increase in vehicle occupancy (from 1.67 to 2.2) and a 75 percent increase (1.67 to 2.92) were even lower fares offered to incentivize shared, autonomous taxi use over personally owned, conventional vehicles. We conclude that consideration of the opportunity costs of driving are integral to the widespread adoption of a technology that may dramatically improve public health outcomes.",0965-8564,Not found
Modeling demand for ridesourcing as feeder for high capacity mass transit systems with an application to the planned Beirut BRT,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.019,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Ridesourcing (Uber, Careem, Lyft, …) is emerging as a main player in the transportation industry. However, its relation to mass transit remains ambiguous, with divided opinions on its complementarity or substitutive effect towards high capacity public transportation systems. This study examines the integration of ridesourcing and transit, particularly focusing on modeling the demand for mass transit when ridesourcing is used as an access or egress mode to mass transit. It extends the existing literature on the integration of transit and new mobility concepts by providing a modeling framework that incorporates all stages of multi-modal trips such as those that involve using mass transit. A mixed logit with error component structure is presented to capture correlations in unobserved factors across multi-modal alternatives sharing similar modes at certain stages. The framework incorporates uni-modal and multi-modal travel alternatives and distinguishes between access, main mode, and egress stages without applying constraints on possible combinations. An application to Beirut’s planned Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, performed on a data set of 392 respondents, reveals that ridesourcing as a feeder mode is mostly popular with young commuters while also being perceived as more reliable than feeder buses and jitneys. Awareness and familiarity are major drivers for the service implying higher potential in the future. A complementarity effect with transit is found as the introduction of ridesourcing at the feeders’ level is expected to drive an additional 2% of commuters to use the BRT. Decreasing ridesourcing fare is effective for its integration with transit, as a fare decrease of 50% increases BRT market share from 33.53% to 36.89% of all motorized trips, implying possible synergies between the two modes. Forecasting results further reveal that additional taxes on parking used by car commuters and increasing park and ride capacity at BRT stations are effective policies to augment BRT ridership.",0965-8564,Not found
Economic and distributional effects of different fare schemes: Evidence from the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.014,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This paper assesses the ability of alternative fare system designs to change the modal-share of public transport use, as well as their corresponding impact on company revenues. Specifically, we provide evidence for how switching from flat to distance fares or from integrated to non-integrated tickets affects both the ridership and the financial situation of public transport companies. Secondly, because distributional concerns are at the heart of the policy debate, we evaluate the impact of the alternative fare schemes on equity. We distinguish between commuting and personal travel purposes. Focusing on the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona, our analysis shows that different pricing structures have only a moderate effect on ridership, while the potential for revenue changes is higher. Regarding equity, our results reveal that the distributional profiles of alternative pricing strategies are quite homogeneous. However, there appears to be a mild regressive effect when an integrated fare system is removed. Our results may help to guide policy decisions related to public transport pricing strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
Integrated impacts of public transport travel and travel satisfaction on quality of life of older people,10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.019,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"This study identifies the relationship between individual's travel and their perceived Quality of Life (QoL). We consider two variables for travel reflecting its objective/quantitative and subjective dimensions. The observed one is a measure based on public transport trip frequency and travel duration obtained from smart card data. The second is the perceived level of Travel Satisfaction which is obtained by survey data. This study is conducted in Shizuoka city, a mid-size city in Japan where we could obtain and link both data sets. We focus particularly on aging effects and therefore divide the data samples into three groups, non-elderly (less than 65 year), younger-old (65–74 years), and older-old (over 75 years). Older people show in general higher travel satisfaction. Regression analysis with travel satisfaction as dependent variable indicate the importance of travel opportunity for older-old. We then identify the relative importance ofmobility on QoL considering both objective and subjective one and discuss transport policy implications for an aging society based on these results. The results provide support that public transport systems are determinants of its usage, travel satisfaction and eventually QoL. These relationships are most evident for younger-old but less significant for older-old.",0965-8564,Not found
How attractive is it to use the internet while commuting? A work-attitude-based segmentation of Northern California commuters,10.1016/j.tra.2020.05.007,138,2020-08-01,2020,8,"We explore how the hypothetical provision of Wi-Fi on transit affects the willingness of non-transit commuters (solo drivers, ridesharers, and cyclists) in Northern California (N = 1402) to switch from their current mode to public transit with internet access (PTWIA). Beyond the prima facie interpretation of our survey results, they shed light on the heterogeneously-perceived utility of hands-free travel more generally, and, as such, speak to an automated-vehicle future. We develop latent class binary choice models of the likelihood of switching to PTWIA, stratified by current commute mode. Each model identifies two latent classes, based largely on work-related attitudes: solo drivers divide into the work-oriented (22%) and pleasure-oriented (78%); ridesharers into the over-traveled monotaskers (77%) and multitasking commuters (23%); and cyclists into work-oriented (28%) and non-work-oriented (72%). Thus, non-work-oriented commuters are a sizable majority of non-transit users, and also have a much lower weighted probability of switching to PTWIA (0.17, on average) compared to the work-oriented commuters (0.48). In sum, work-friendly hands-free travel can be an appealing alternative to those who are oriented toward working (and especially on the commute), but (1) not for all of them, and (2) such people only constitute about a quarter of the non-transit commuters (in Northern California). These results provide empirical insight into the extent to which the productive use of travel time made possible by automated vehicles will be exploited by future commuters.",0965-8564,Not found
Using a sequential latent class approach for model averaging: Benefits in forecasting and behavioural insights,10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.005,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Despite the frequent use of model averaging in many disciplines from weather forecasting to health outcomes, it is not yet an idea often considered in travel behaviour or choice modelling. The idea behind model averaging is that a single model can be created by calculating contribution weights for a set of candidate models, depending on their relative performance, thus creating an ‘average’. There are different ways of doing this, with a clear distinction between looking at the overall performance of each model or by doing this at the level of individual agents or observations. In this paper, we demonstrate that a relatively straightforward adaptation of latent class models can be used for the latter approach and show how this can be an effective method for travel behaviour modelling. We identify two key opportunities for model averaging. The first is the situation where an analyst faces the difficult choice between a number of advanced models, all with some desirable properties. The second is the situation where advanced models cannot be used due to the size of the data and/or choice sets. Our tests demonstrate that in both cases, model averaging using a sequential latent class framework results in a consistent improvement in model fit for both estimation and in forecasting with subsets of validation samples. Additionally, we demonstrate that model averaging can be used to obtain more reliable elasticities and welfare measures by averaging across outputs obtained from the set of candidate models. In terms of actual implementation of model averaging, we present a simple expectation–maximisation (EM) algorithm which can deal with very large numbers of candidate models within the same model averaging structure, unlike the typical case with classical estimation approaches for latent class.",0965-8564,Not found

Based on a large data set with information on sections of the road network, including age, pavement type, and traffic, a more disaggregate analysis of pavement life than that in the literature is facilitated. The analytical strategy enables identification of major differences in marginal costs across the road network. This establishes that the deterioration of the road quality can be attributed not only to heavy vehicles but also light vehicles such as passenger cars, a possible reason being the widespread use of studded tires in a country with regular freeze-thaw cycles. Due to the limited width of time windows of the dataset observations, no evidence could be found to support the notion that road deterioration is significantly influenced by time alone.",0965-8564,Not found
"Economic growth, transport accessibility and regional equity impacts of high-speed railways in Italy: ten years ex post evaluation and future perspectives",10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.008,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The deployment of HSR services in the recent decades has been, arguably, the most significant innovation for intercity travel around the globe. HSR has brought impacts which have been widely studied in different countries in relation to the different socioeconomic, territorial and transport characteristics. This paper analyses the economic growth, the transport accessibility and the social impacts observed in Italy after ten years of HSR operation, as well as the estimated impacts of the system completion. The Italian case study is of particular interest since along the 1,467 km of new high speed line (300 km/h), a combination of major cities distances and a unique HSR competitive market, producing prices reductions and more daily trains, brought a 200% increase of HSR demand (from 15 to 45 millions of passengers/year). Estimations results show that, on average, HSR in Italy contributed to a significant increase in transport accessibility (+32%) for the zones along the HSR network, while only marginal for the others (+6%). Impacts on the economic growth show that HSR has contributed to an extra growth of per capita GDP of + 2.6% in 10 years and would have contributed to a further increase of 3.6% if the final project scenario (HSR_N) would had been completed by 2018. Regional (horizontal) equity impacts were evaluated in terms of the Gini indexes variations with respect to the distribution of the transport accessibility. It results that HSR in Italy has decreased equity in terms of users’ travel time accessibility of 11%, increasing the differences between the zones served by HSR and those not. If the HSR_N scenario would have been completed equity indices would have increased of 29% with respect to the pre-HSR 2008 scenario, thus reducing regional inequalities in the country. Results show that the HSR project was a country-level “game changer” in Italy, suggesting that the wider economic benefits, the assumptions on market regulation, the effects on regional disparities and the compensatory measures should be included in the ex ante and ex post evaluation of similar projects.",0965-8564,Not found
"Domestic workers’ commutes in Bogotá: Transportation, gender and social exclusion",10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.019,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Transportation, gender and social exclusion have increasingly come together in scholarly pursuits and policy agendas in Latin America and the Caribbean. The recognition of the gender dimension of sustainable mobility has opened a space to consider the role of women, especially of those facing poverty and exclusion, in this global agenda. However, research on the link between precarious occupations, social exclusion, and gender, and the role that mobility plays both in enhancing and limiting development opportunities for highly vulnerable workers in the Global South is still limited. Based on Bogotá’s 2015 Mobility Survey, data from an application that matches domestic workers with employers (HogarU) and interviews conducted with domestic workers, this paper investigates the case of Bogotá, Colombia, to describe domestic workers’ daily commutes. More specifically, it focuses on the long duration of their trips, their patterns, their inevitable connection to public transportation, and the financial implications for their restricted family budget. Considering a legal provision that establishes a time-window for switching between public transportation vehicles, the paper also examines its effects on domestic workers’ commutes. By doing so, the paper aims to address the situation not only of the massive group of female domestic workers traversing the city every day, but also of other similarly situated social groups that could find in transportation a path towards greater social inclusion.",0965-8564,Not found
Misguided quality incentives: The case of the santiago bus system,10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.014,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"This article helps explain why incentive-based contracts have failed in some cities. It also explicitly shows how contracted kilometer- and passenger-based payments affect transit service quality. First, we study how contract renegotiations in 2012 and 2013 affected quality related to service kilometers in the bus public transport system of Santiago, Chile. To do that, we analyze the evolution of compliance measures and estimate the effect of renegotiations on key performance indicators. The main results are that the renegotiation of 2012 led to minor improvements in frequency compliance but deterioration in regularity, whereas the renegotiation of 2013 led to reduced fines for non-compliance with no change in frequency compliance and decreased regularity. Second, we formulate a model to analyze the behavior of a firm operating under a contract like the one in Santiago. We identify conditions that must be present for an operator to provide the contracted service kilometers, depending on the per-kilometer and per-passenger payments stipulated in the contract. The results of the analysis are empirically tested, and we conclude that the incentives in Santiago do not sufficiently incentivize contract compliance. A central result is a formula for payment per kilometer and payment per passenger when the objective is the provision of service kilometers.",0965-8564,Not found
Determinants of intention-to-use first-/last-mile automated bus service,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.001,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The successful adoption of a product or service by its target market or users relies on delivering a product or service in line with their needs and expectations. Failure to do so will likely result in a low rate of uptake or use of the product or service. This study sought to identify the criteria by which potential users of a first-/last-mile automated bus (AB) service would evaluate the service, and accordingly decide whether to use or disregard the service. This research investigated various explanatory factors affecting users’ perceptions of the service’s quality and utility, and which enhanced or diminished their intentions to use it. The data analysed in this study was collected from a survey conducted in February and March of 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden, during a trial operation of a first-/last-mile AB service. Three-factor theory analysis, commonly used to analyse services, was applied to this data in order to identify users’ core perceptions about the service, which in turn influence their intention-to-use the service. Structural equation modelling was used to identify the significant factors that influence the identified perceptions influencingthe intention-to-use the service. This study found that different subgroups of users prioritised different attributes. Prospective users (with no prior experience with the service) were most concerned with the frequency of service. Their intention-to-use the service greatly increased when the service frequency is comparable to the service frequency of a regular public bus service. Experienced users’ intentions to continue using the service greatly increased when the buses were made more comfortable. This study additionally found that users’ perceptions of the service’s quality were also influenced by numerous factors including the passenger’s age, income level, preferred mode of travel for daily trips, preferred mode of travel for first-/last-mile trips, being tech-savvy or not, and their level of familiarity with automated driving technology.",0965-8564,Not found
Impacts of variable message signs on en-route route choice behavior,10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.015,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Background Variable message signs (VMS) have been widely applied to alleviate traffic congestion by providing spatiotemporal information related to traffic and network conditions to drivers. There is a debate on whether the VMS information would lead to the less-alleviation of congestion or congestion transfer to the adjacent roads in the different traffic congestion situations due to the inappropriate VMS information. Additionally, it is still unknown how to find a practically applicable method to design the most effective VMS information for drivers. Objective In order to design and display the appropriate VMS information for drivers under different traffic conditions, this paper aims to identify the effects of VMS on individuals’ route choice behavior by exploring the different effects of VMS on the several separate groups. Drivers in these groups are homogenous in gender, driving experience, education level, occupation, and monthly income. Methods In the hypothetical scenario, a stated preference (SP) questionnaire was conducted to build the dataset consisting of 3462 samples from local private and taxi drivers. The decision tree via the chi-squared automatic interactive detector (CHAID) algorithm is utilized to split drivers into several groups, and further two fixed-parameter logistic regression models considering intra-heterogeneity between drivers (i.e., considering and not considering systematic taste variations), and random-parameter logistic regression models are employed to analyze the factors affecting driver route choice behavior of each group. Results Five groups with different driver characteristics are identified. Besides, the modeling results indicate that the effect of the VMS information on individual route choice behavior is heterogeneous. These findings include: (i) random-parameter logistic regression models have a significantly improved goodness-of-fit because of the lower AIC and BIC; (ii) compared with the stated cause information on road construction and congestion, the accident information had a larger effect on driver route choice behaviors; (iii) the route choice behaviors of drivers with more than 6-year driving experience are affected by the VMS information on road constructions, accidents, and the quantitative delay time; (V) the route choice behaviors of less-experienced female drivers were affected by display formats and display frequencies of VMS information. Conclusions The findings from this study can assist traffic authorities in designing the most appropriate VMS for different traffic congestions based on driver characteristic distribution and the road capacity for improving the practicability of VMS information and further provide the theoretical evidence for the design of in-vehicle personalized information service systems.",0965-8564,Not found
Transport policy evaluation based on elasticity analysis with social interactions,10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.011,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The effects of social interactions on individual behaviour have been observed in many social phenomena, including travel-related behaviour involving direct or indirect contact with other agents. However, most formulations of urban transport policy assume that individual behaviour is independent of each other, which likely results in policy evaluation bias. Therefore, this study aimed at urban parking behaviour with frequent interactions among agents in Taiwan (1) to examine the influence of others’ behaviour on individuals by modelling parking location choice and introducing social utility and (2) to develop a modified elasticity analysis method that considers policy spillover effects driven by social interactions and then use it to conduct parking policy evaluation based on the choice model. A stated preference survey targeting scooter and bicycle users was performed through face-to-face interviews to simulate parking policy and reference-group behaviour levels. The pseudo panel where the observations of each respondent may be interdependent was addressed by a mixed logit model incorporating an error component to capture unobserved individual heterogeneity. The results of the model estimation supported the presence of social interactions among users and identified other influential determinants of parking location choice including travel characteristics (visit frequency and vehicle used), psychological heterogeneity (attitudes and personal norms), and parking policy (distance, fixed cost, and marginal cost). For policy evaluation, the proposed elasticity analysis method with social interactions illustrated that policy spillover effects (49.7%) were nearly as strong as direct policy effects (50.3%). Two-wheel vehicle parking policy measures containing soft measures based on attitudes and personal norms and hard measures considering social influences were presented for on-street parking mitigation.",0965-8564,Not found
Developing an urban bikeability index for different types of cyclists as a tool to prioritise bicycle infrastructure investments,10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.010,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"This study proposes an urban Bikeability Index (BI) to assess and prioritise bicycle infrastructure investments, and in turn, improve accessibility for cyclists. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we construct a BI that addresses particularities of the roads in cities of the Global South and considers the preferences, perceptions and socioeconomic characteristics by type of cyclist. Second, a tool is developed for decision-makers to prioritise investments in bicycle infrastructure, considering the estimated BI and expected cyclist flows. The methodology is structured into two stages. The first stage constructs a new BI following three steps. First, we select the most important factors and components related to biking behaviour. Second, we estimate weights for selected factors and components by using a discrete choice model to analyse users’ perceptions based on results from ranking surveys. Third, we estimate the BI by type of cyclist as a weighted additive function, which are equivalent to the probabilities calculated using the discrete choice model. The second stage proposes a direct demand model to prioritise bicycle infrastructure investments based on the estimation of BIs, and expected flows of cyclists. We applied the methodology to Barranquilla, Colombia and ranked different bicycle infrastructure investments for increasing bicycle demand in the city. The results suggest that even though primary roads are currently associated with low BI values due to high rates of road accidents, they tend to be preferred by cyclists. The presence of adequate bicycle infrastructure is the most crucial factor for people who frequently cycle for sport, while traffic safety and security are the most critical factors for those who cycle to work.",0965-8564,Not found

This article seeks to understand to what extent individuals’ perceived mobility necessities (PMN), activity pattern complexity, and temporal, spatial, social, or compulsory constraints in everyday activities inhibit switching from private motorized transport modes to more environmentally friendly modes. We formulate an Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model that accounts for PMN and activity patterns, complexity and constraints. To estimate the model, we used two datasets: the first dataset is the Danish National Transport Survey, which is a large dataset consisting of approximately 150,000 respondents; the second is a small(er) but highly detailed dataset, which contains relevant information regarding activity patterns, constraints and PMN. We found that the more complex the activity patterns are, the higher are both PMN and the probability of selecting car and bike, and this effect is even more evident when individuals are constrained by some activities. Consistently, individuals who perceive high mobility needs are more likely to select car and bike. The result that mobility needs and related constraints increase cycling conflicts with results found in low-cycling countries. Yet, it indicates that the bike can play a similar role as the car when the respective infrastructure is provided.

Since a fiscal burden would be incurred from the contingent liability of issuing a guarantee, charging a fee for the guarantee is considered an effective remedy for management of contingent liabilities in practice. This study incorporates the charge mechanism for minimum traffic guarantee (MTG) into consideration, and proposes a method to choose the optimal concession contract variables with a paid MTG. We find that the government sector will specify a lower toll and a higher capacity for a BOT road with a paid MTG. As a result, the society suffers a social welfare loss when providing a paid MTG. Meanwhile, both the charging fee of an MTG and the guaranteed traffic volume would increase the loss of social welfare, which means the incentive mechanism of private participation and the management of contingent liabilities (charging fee for MTG) are all at the expense of social welfare. Moreover, since the welfare loss is magnified under a high marginal social cost condition, the government should set the charging fee and guaranteed traffic volume according to the marginal social cost level. In addition, to obtain more insights, this paper has made two extensions to further investigate the effects of a paid MTG (1) when contracting with a risk averse private investor; (2) when the concession period is an endogenous variable. Based on our model results, this paper derives several policy implications regarding BOT contract design when a paid MTG is provided.",0965-8564,Not found
To scoot or not to scoot: Findings from a recent survey about the benefits and barriers of using E-scooters for riders and non-riders,10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.009,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"E-scooters are rapidly changing transportation in US cities and university campuses. Hailed as a convenient, inexpensive solution for “last mile” and other short trips, e-scooters are available in over 100 US cities and were used for nearly forty million trips in 2018. Yet relatively little is known about e-scooter use, including who uses them, for which types of trips, and the perceived benefits and barriers related to e-scooters. This information is particularly important in light of concerns about safety and the loss of physical activity (PA) due to replacing walking and biking with e-scooting. In this paper, we aim to characterize trends in the barriers and benefits related to e-scooter use within a professional population. We surveyed 1,256 university staff in Tempe, AZ, finding that 36% of respondents had ridden e-scooters and 40% indicated that they would do so outside of campus in the next year. Overwhelmingly, e-scooters are seen as a convenient way to travel, particularly in the heat and compared to walking. However, demographic differences were notable, particularly regarding barriers. African American and non-white Hispanic respondents were significantly more likely than non-Hispanic white respondents to intend to try e-scooters and to be unhappy with current transportation options. E-scooters are also associated with concerns about traffic safety – particularly for women – and barriers related to being able to find working equipment when needed. These findings suggest that e-scooters fill an important transportation niche and may contribute to transportation equity, and that efforts to address barriers could further enhance that contribution.",0965-8564,Not found
Environmental governance of transportation infrastructure under Belt and Road Initiative: A unified framework,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.001,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has attracted much attention in the field of transportation research. With a primary goal to improve regional and global connectivity, the initiative proposes a massive development programme of transportation infrastructure (TI) linking China with the rest of the world. While it creates a tremendous development opportunity, the unprecedented scale of TI construction also brings various challenges. In particular, the environmental impacts of the TI projects are of critical concern. Herein, smooth implementation of the TI projects would depend on the capacity of all the concerned actors to conduct collaborative planning and integrate environmental considerations. Therefore, from a multi-actor perspective, this paper aims to provide a unified framework of the environmental governance of the TI projects under the BRI. The goal is achieved through a focused review of relevant research articles and technical reports published in both English and Chinese. Based on the review findings, the framework along with four propositions are derived, focusing on the key actors (who), the environmental considerations (what) and the governance structures (how). The study concludes with theoretical and managerial implications.",0965-8564,Not found
Transportation professionals' visions of transit sexual assault: The problem of deproblematizing beliefs,10.1016/j.tra.2020.03.023,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"This study examines planners’ views of transit sexual assault in two transit systems where sexual assault is widespread, but little action has been taken: TransMilenio Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Bogotá and Soacha, Colombia and informal transit in El Alto, Bolivia. In both cases, many planners lack information about transit sexual assault in their city, and the agencies do not systematically measure its frequency. Additionally, planners’ views of transit sexual assault are shaped by five widespread deproblematizing beliefs: (1) victims of sexual assault on transit are often mistaken or lying; (2) groping and sexual rubbing do not seriously harm victims; (3) victims brought the attack on themselves; (4) assault is natural and unchangeable; and (5) planners should not be responsible for addressing sexual assault because they did not create the problem. These beliefs, which were more common among male planners, pose a significant barrier to action because they support an attitude that sexual assault on transit is not a problem to which planners should devote resources; either there is no problem to solve or attempting to solve it is so difficult as to be futile. Additionally, deproblematizing beliefs reduce openness to new data about transit sexual assault. The belief that women are likely to mistake innocent actions for sexual assault renders some planners dismissive of survey data based on the self reports of (ostensibly) unreliable narrators. The results indicate that in the long term, a gender mainstreaming approach that includes training for planners is needed. In the short term, one critical task is to convince reluctant reformers that transit sexual assault is a problem on which planners can and should take action.",0965-8564,Not found
A framework for the impact of highly automated vehicles with limited operational design domains,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.024,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Highly automated vehicles (AV) are in the early stages of deployment and are likely to have significant impacts on the United States transportation system. In particular, a broad deployment of shared, on-demand AVs might significantly impact vehicle ownership and transportation energy consumption; projecting these impacts is essential for climate, infrastructure, and policy planning. However, it seems increasingly likely that AVs will be deployed gradually over a period of decades, in which case there may be geographic or functional variation in their availability. This might occur for a combination of technological, policy, and economic reasons. This manuscript seeks to advance a new framework for projecting AV impacts, with a particular focus on energy consumption impacts. Specifically, we introduce a framework for AV impacts that allows for AVs catering to specific operating environments or ride types. As a demonstration of this framework, we use the 2009 National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS) to segment US household travel demand based on built environment and ride length. Our framework allows us to specify AV “availability” for each population segment and ride type and use that information to predict the impact of AVs. We analyze a case scenario where shared, on-demand AVs are mostly suited for short trips in highly urbanized environments. We project the impact on household relocation, private vehicle ownership, induced travel demand, and fuel consumption. Utilization of this framework would help identify policy levers for sustainable deployment of AVs.",0965-8564,Not found
The importance of consumer motives for green mobility: A multi-modal perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.021,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"While most consumers agree that adopting more sustainable mobility behaviors should be a priority, this attitude often fails to translate into actual behavior. We argue that this is because sustainable mobility products do not sufficiently satisfy consumer mobility motives. To investigate this issue from a multi-modal perspective, we first synthesized previous research into a general measure of superordinate consumer motives in the mobility domain. We then conducted a representative survey experiment in which potential mobility consumers (N = 504) reported their mobility motives and their purchase intentions for a diverse set of mobility products including electric vehicles, hybrid-electric vehicles, efficient fuel cars, electric bikes, annual public transport tickets and sport utility vehicles. In line with our expectations, mobility motives substantially contributed to explaining all purchase intentions on top of demographic variables and prior ownership. While environmental motives were the most important predictor, also status, financial, independence, safety and hedonic motives contributed substantially to the prediction of mobility purchase intentions. We discuss the importance of consumer motives as a basis for marketing and policy measures, to effectively promote sustainable mobility alternatives during the rise of multi-modal mobility.",0965-8564,Not found
"Puzzling over parking: Assessing the transitional parking requirement in Vancouver, British Columbia",10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.007,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Drawing upon Flyvbjerg's (1998) insight that planning is defined more by the political than the rational, we examine the experience of parking reform, as attempted by municipal officials, in Vancouver, British Columbia. The literature offers a broad consensus that minimum parking requirements represent a misguided and inefficient policy producing excess parking in the wrong places and reduced housing affordability. Yet minimum parking requirements remain a near-universal fixture in municipal regulations. We examine the stubborn disconnect between Vancouver’s parking standards and its strategic policies. Rather than reiterating normative debates, we consider how ideas and institutions could shape officials’ hesitation in reform. We reveal the compromise that ensues under planning's duality of designing credible, forward-looking strategy while managing the political constraints created by policy path dependence. We find that Vancouver’s laneway housing parking requirement represents a typology that could propagate across North America: a transitional parking requirement of political compromise, which, we suggest, has the potential to produce a workable reconciliation of theory and practice.",0965-8564,Not found

In doing so, first, it sets up the complex network in the CR express transport. Second, based on the restraint coefficients in the theory of structural hole such as network scale, efficiency, grading and clustering co-efficiency, this paper applies the Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) model in association with algorithm development in calculating the importance of the CR express nodes including both inland nodes and seaport nodes. The paper has three-fold contributions. In theory, it confirms the accuracy and practicability of the structural hole theory in the importance ranking of nodes in the complex network.

A comparison in travel patterns and determinants of user demand between docked and dockless bike-sharing systems using multi-sourced data,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.022,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The co-existence of traditional docked bike-sharing and emerging dockless systems presents new opportunities for sustainable transportation in cities all over the world, both serving door to door trips and accessing/egressing to/from public transport systems. However, most of the previous studies have separately examined the travel patterns of docked and dockless bike-sharing schemes, whereas the difference in travel patterns and the determinants of user demand for both systems have not been fully understood. To fill this gap, this study firstly compares the travel characteristics, including travel distance, travel time, usage frequency and spatio-temporal travel patterns by exploring the smart card data from a docked bike-sharing scheme and trip origin–destination (OD) data from a dockless bike-sharing scheme in the city of Nanjing, China over the same spatio-temporal dimension. Next, this study examines the influence of the bike-sharing fleets, socio-demographic factors and land use factors on user demand of both bike-sharing systems using multi-sourced data (e.g., trip OD information, smart card, survey, land use information, and housing prices data). To this end, geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) models are built to examine the determinants of user demand over space and time. Comparative analysis shows that dockless bike-sharing systems have a shorter average travel distance and travel time, but a higher use frequency and hourly usage volume compared to docked bike-sharing systems. Trips of docked and dockless bike-sharing on workdays are more frequent than those on weekends, especially during the morning and evening rush hours. Significant differences in the spatial distribution between docked and dockless bike-sharing systems are observed in different city areas. The results of the GTWR models reveal that hourly docked bike-sharing trips and dockless bike-share trips influence each other throughout the week. The density of Entertainment points of interest (POIs) is positively correlated with the usage of dockless bike-sharing, but negatively correlated with docked bike-sharing usage. On the contrary, the proportion of the elderly has a positive association with the usage of docked bike-sharing,but a negative association withthe usage of dockless bike-sharing. Finally, policy implications and suggestions are proposed to improve the performance of docked and dockless bike-sharing systems, such as increasing the flexibility of docked bike-sharing, designing and promoting mobile applications (APP) for docked bike-sharing, improving the quality of dockless shared bikes, and implementing dynamic time-based pricing strategies for dockless bike-sharing.",0965-8564,Not found
Commuter value perceptions in peak avoidance behavior: An empirical study in the Beijing subway system,10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.001,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Peak-avoidance has been suggested as a strategy to ease congestion and improve the travel experience in the road traffic system. However, commuters’ trade-offs when choosing whether to avoid the peak in the context of subway use have not yet been explored. In highly concentrated megacities, high demand during peak hours in the subway leads to long queues waiting to enter stations or platforms, as well as crowded trains, which yields highly negative externalities. This paper contextualizes and incorporates commuters’ perceived value as a theoretical basis to explain how perceived benefits and perceived sacrifices affect commuters’ intentions to avoid the peak in subway systems. A hybrid model was constructed to incorporate the perceived benefits and perceived sacrifices as latent variables to understand peak-avoidance behavior. Social norms, previous habits, and personal subjective feelings have significant impacts on subway commuters’ peak-avoidance decisions. In addition, our combined model improved the explanatory power compared to a traditional ordered logit model. The framework can be used as a theoretical basis for further development of behavioral research into commuters’ decision-making. Finally, these findings provide meaningful guidance for the government and subway companies to encourage travelers to avoid rush hours effectively.",0965-8564,Not found
Air and rail connectivity patterns of major city clusters in China,10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.002,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"This study proposes a series of statistical and regression approaches to investigate city-cluster transport connectivity patterns. Three major city clusters in China are selected for this study, namely, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) economic zones. Our analyses examine three aspects of city-cluster connectivity patterns: (i) connectivity distribution among cities within the city cluster; (ii) dependence of the non-center city on the center city; and (iii) the impact of improved intra-city-cluster rail connectivity on air-connectivity distribution. First, it is found that the BTH has the most concentrated connectivity among the three city clusters, with Beijing clearly dominating the other cities in every kind of connectivity. The connectivity distributions are more balanced in the YRD and PRD. Second, the calculated “survival connectivity” and regression analyses suggest that non-center cities heavily rely on the center city as the hub to develop their network connectivity. Such a “hub-and-spoke system” helps a non-center city improve total connectivity but reduces its direct connectivity to other cities outside the city cluster. Finally, our regression analysis shows that improved intra-city-cluster rail connectivity further deteriorates the air-connectivity disparity within the city cluster, which occurs because the center city benefits more from the upgraded air-HSR (high speed rail) intermodal connectivity because it can attract air passengers from neighboring non-center cities. Relevant policy implications and suggestions are also discussed in the paper. We believe the proposed statistical and regression approaches can be easily applied to examine city-cluster connectivity in other contexts and countries.",0965-8564,Not found
A joint panel binary logit and fractional split model for converting route-level transit ridership data to stop-level boarding and alighting data,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.015,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Detailed ridership analytics requires refined data on transit ridership to understand factors affecting ridership (at the stop and/or route-level). However, detailed data for stop-based boarding and alighting information are not readily available for the entire bus system. Transit agencies usually resort to compiling ridership data on a sample of buses operating on the various routes. We propose an approach to infer stop-level ridership for transit systems that only compile route-level ridership information. A joint model structure of binary logit and fractional split model is proposed to estimate stop-level ridership data sourced from route-level ridership. The model is developed for the Greater Orlando region with ridership data for 8 quadrimesters (four-month time periods) from May 2014 through December 2016. In the presence of repeated data measures, panel version of the joint econometric models for boarding and alighting are estimated. The development of such an analytical framework will allow bus systems with only route-level ridership data to generate stop-level ridership data. The model results offer intuitive results and clearly supports our hypothesis that it is feasible to generate stop-level ridership with route-level ridership data. For transit agencies with ridership data at the stop-level, the proposed model can also be employed to understand how various stops along a route interact with one another toward affecting route-level ridership contributions.",0965-8564,Not found
Sexual harassment in public transport in Bogotá,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.018,139,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Although the last decades have seen an advance in equality and empowerment for women, there are still numerous challenges to be addressed. Among them, and particularly pressing in cities, are issues of gender-based violence, including sexual harassment in public spaces. Despite the numerous effects that street harassment has on women, and the high incidence of it in different countries, this issue has not been broadly studied, and even less so in cities in the Global South. This study aims to characterise the ways in which women in Bogotá experience sexual harassment in public spaces, specifically focusing on public transport and including vehicles, stations, stops and walking routes to and from their origins or destinations. Focusing on this objective, this study made use of a mixed-method approach, including an online self-completing questionnaire, as well as in-depth semi-structured interviews. The data gathered showed that sexual harassment in public transport – and public space – is widespread in Bogotá, and intersections with age and class play a very important role. Additionally, episodes of sexual harassment are widely under-reported, and there is a general perception that reporting is useless, which is supported by accounts of women who have tried to report an incident and have faced several difficulties. Finally, policies proposed so far in Bogotá have been unsuccessful in reducing sexual harassment in public transport and, in many cases, do not tackle the problem. Consequently, a comprehensive set of policies aimed at preventing and reducing sexual harassment in different spaces associated with public transport must be put in place.",0965-8564,Not found

Specifically, we examine the intensity of competition in the industry using a unique dataset, to evaluate the economic effects of two major deregulations in 2002 and 2013. The absence of organized data means there is no previous research that quantitatively evaluates the deregulations. We collect data capturing the entry of bus operating companies by web-scraping and use a structural estimation method developed in econometrics for the purpose of measuring the degree of competition. Our empirical analysis yields the following three main results. First, we find that the markup ratios always exceed 1, which indicates that the entry of one additional firm always intensifies competition. Specifically, the markup gained by one firm under duopoly is estimated to be about three quarters of that under monopoly. Second, the competitive effect of an additional entry decreases as the number of incumbents increases. This result is obtained irrespective of the mode of competition. Third, we find that the services offered by firms in the industry are significantly differentiated. Counterfactual analysis reveals that additional 0.76 firms can enter a market on average by differentiating their products from each other. These results provide useful insights into the development of competition policy pertaining to the contemporary transportation industry.",0965-8564,Not found

Unlike the traditional user type classification, our study classifies respondents into three segments: Direct Trip Enthusiastic (DTE), Cost-Sensitive (CS), and Real-time Information Supporter (RIS). Each segment exhibits different preferences for transit service attributes, and their willingness to pay for service improvements is distinctly different.

Valuation of travel time reliability: Considering the traveler's adaptive expectation with an indifference band on daily trip duration,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.002,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"In this article, we focus on the valuation of travel time reliability that considers the adaptive expectation with an indifference band on daily trip duration. Owing to the learning effect of adaptive expectation, travel time variation relates to the travel time forecast bias but not to the absolute deviation of daily trip duration. Meanwhile, the indifference band toward travel time variation moderates the adaptive expectation formation in daily trip repetition. In this case, travel time reliability follows the discrete probability distribution. We use the rank-dependent utility framework to capture the value of travel time reliability (VOR), in which the probability transformation accommodates the risk attitude toward random trip duration and provides us the subjective probability weight to each potential reliability point. Numerical simulation indicates that the traveler's subjective VOR awareness associates with both learning rate and indifference band in the adaptive expectation on daily trip duration.

Interrelationships among service quality factors of Metro Rail Transit System: An integrated Bayesian networks and PLS-SEM approach,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.014,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Finding ways to improve the service quality and consequently attract more passengers is a major concern for public transit officials worldwide. Given the fact that there is a glaring deficiency of service quality models in the literature, especially for developing nations, the present study develops interrelationships among service quality factors of Metro Rail Transit System (MRTS) in Delhi, India. For this purpose, the study implemented an integrated Bayesian Networks (BN) and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach on perceptions of 2390 passengers of Delhi Metro. Firstly, the study extracted 41 service quality indicators into eight service quality factors using principal component analysis. Secondly, the extracted factors were learnt in BN to achieve the most robust network structure. Thirdly, the robust BN structure was tested and analysed in PLS-SEM to develop a service quality model. The integrated methodological approach has facilitated in identifying hidden interrelationships among service quality factors through a systematic manner. The developed model indicates ‘passenger ease’ as the most influential and ‘amenities’ as the least influential factors of overall service quality (OSQ). The OSQ index of 79.59 reveals the moderate satisfaction of passengers with Delhi Metro services. The study proposed several insights into the service quality improvements for Delhi Metro that must be focused and enriched for increasing Metro transit ridership. This knowledge of interrelationships among service quality factors can help transit officials in formulating effective strategies and investment plans accordingly to meet the passengers’ needs.",0965-8564,Not found

The objective of this article is to elucidate the social and spatial inclusiveness of bike sharing, by exploring its intersectionality with user backgrounds and residential contexts, and its mechanisms of mediation by attitudes, mobility resources and daily mobility patterns. Hereto, the paper examines and cross-compares the discrepancies between stated bike sharing interest and reported bike sharing membership, amongst a sample of 3672 residents of urban regions in Norway in structural equation models (SEM). Our results indicate that interest is positively influenced by early adopter characteristics, such as young age, full-time work, environmental consciousness, urban outlook, urban residential locations, and the current adoption of combined bicycle and public transport use. In contrast, reported bike sharing membership is explained more typically as a travel behaviour: with reduced effects of attitudes; enhanced effects of residential urban form and bicycle-public transport use; and additional negative effects of car and bike ownership. The paper concludes by discussing these and other interest-adoption discrepancies across social and spatial categories, to derive policy and research directions for inclusive bike sharing.",0965-8564,Not found
How fair is the allocation of bike-sharing infrastructure? Framework for a qualitative and quantitative spatial fairness assessment,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.007,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"How fair is the allocation of the infrastructure of a bike-sharing system (BSS)? Design guidelines for BSSs focus on optimizing the demand but not on who is served who is not. Areas where mainly young Caucasians, highly educated people live, and that have high access to community resources, presented greater access to BSS. Based on the concept of spatial fairness and its subjectivity, we developed a framework for a qualitative and quantitative assessment to help decision-makers and the general public evaluate the allocation of BSS infrastructure. First, from the general concept of justice, we developed our definition of spatial fairness assessment based on the rules of spatial equity, equality, and efficiency. Then, we developed a qualitative and quantitative spatial fairness assessment of BSS. The qualitative assessment aims to understand how underprivileged people perceive the spatial fairness of BSSs taking as case study non-motorized households in Strasbourg feeling socially excluded. The quantitative assessment helps to numerically determine which distribution rule (equity, equality, efficiency) the infrastructure of a BSS follows. This assessment was applied in residential blocks inside the service area of the hybrid BSS in Munich, Germany. We developed a concept of availability as an accessibility indicator. As social indicators, we considered social milieus, access to other opportunities (e.g. health, education), and developed a deprivation index that is a combination of those two. As a result of the qualitative assessment, non-motorized individuals who felt socially excluded were less likely to talk about BSS at all. Furthermore, bicycles’ availability in the bike-sharing system in Munich matched the efficiency and equity rule, although lower availability of bikes correlates to residential blocks where traditional-oriented social groups live. Policy makers, stakeholders, urban and transport planners, and the general public have now available 1) the perception of a group of the underprivileged population about BSS, and 2) a quantitative methodology to identify which distribution rule(s) the infrastructure of a BSS follows and which social groups are spatially advantaged or disadvantaged by it. Further research may be oriented to apply the approach in the same city or applying them to more case studies.",0965-8564,Not found
Modelling the influence of peers’ attitudes on choice behaviour: Theory and empirical application on electric vehicle preferences,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.016,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"While the importance of social influence on transport-related choices is commonly acknowledged within the transport and travel behaviour research community, there remain several challenges in modelling influence in practice. This paper proposes a new analytical approach to measure the effects of attitudes of peers on the decision making process of the individual. Indeed, while most of the previous literature focused its attention on capturing conformity to a certain real or hypothetical choice, we investigate the subtle effect of attitudes that underlies this choice. Specifically, the suggested measure enables us to model the correlated effect that might indirectly affect the individual’s choice within a social group. It combines detailed information on the attitudes in the individual’s social network and the social proximity of the individuals in the social network. To understand its behavioural implications on the individual’s choice, the individual’s peer attitude variable is tested in different components of a hybrid choice model. Our results show that the inclusion of this variable indirectly affects the decision making process of the individual as the peers’ attitudes are significantly related to the latent attitude of the individual. On the other hand, it does not seem to directly affect the utility of an alternative as a source of systematic heterogeneity nor does it work as a manifestation of the latent variable, i.e. as an indicator.",0965-8564,Not found

Some methodologies that maximise coverage or accessibility are suggested in the literature. In this paper, we propose a bike-sharing stations location model that includes not only these issues but also equality aspects. The model aims to minimise inequalities in bicycle-public transport mobility among observed population groups trying to maintain specified levels of accessibility and coverage at the same time. We evaluated the performance of the model on a test network and carried out a sensitivity analysis according to the available budget. The results showed that maximising accessibility or coverage alone, without considering equality, may lead to an unequal distribution of accessibility among the population, producing discrimination between different groups. The outcomes of the application revealed the significance of the model in evaluating equality in the network design phase for achieving not only a satisfactory bike-sharing system and public transport multimodal accessibility of each zone but also a high equality measure among the considered population groups. Budget availability also played an essential role since a minimum budget value is needed to achieve higher levels of equality. The proposed approach could serve transport and public authorities as a decision support system in planning future investment as well as promoting multimodal mobility because it links bike-sharing stations with stops/stations of the public transport lines networks.",0965-8564,Not found

In this paper, a game theory concept is used and the payoff function for each UAV is defined based on the coverage probability value, which depends on the altitude and the characteristic of antennas in the UAVs. We introduce a mathematical formulation for evaluating the payoff values based on a set of actions for each UAV, and the Nash equilibrium for this kind of game. This approach works in an intelligent way based on the interactions between the UAVs and their neighbors in a connected network and it might work even in harsh environments. In order to minimize interference, the UAVs’ altitudes are adjusted based on the antennas and other deployment requirements (i.e. search and surveillance purposes) by using the minimum number of UAVs to cover the candidate geographical region. The simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves the maximum coverage value, converges fast with the environmental changes based on the power levels, and robust for failure scenarios. Finally, we compare our approach against one of the traditional approaches called Collaborative Visual Area Coverage Approach (CVACA) based on uniform coverage quality. The simulation results show that the game approach outperforms the traditional approach in term of the coverage value and the computational time.",0965-8564,Not found
"Travel behaviour in Brisbane: Trends, saturation, patterns and changes",10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.019,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Peak–car is characterised by slower rates of growth, levelling off, or a reduction in car travel. Researchers have paid much attention to this topic recently. However, a consensus on possible explanations of the phenomenon remains elusive. Questions remain whether the drivers of travel demand are changing and projection methods need to be revised, or the peak–car is purely an external effect (e.g. fuel price, financial crisis) and car travel continues to increase when such effects are nullified. The study investigates these issues focusing on Brisbane using six versions of the South East Queensland Household Travel Survey data (1992, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2018). Three different analytical methods were employed. First, four pooled regression models were estimated to examine the effects of time (external effects) on travel behaviour, controlling for different socio-demographics and built environment factors. Second, five multiple linear regression models were estimated using 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2018 datasets to identify behavioural differences between different groups in a specific point in time. Third, differences in coefficients as generated in the second stage were estimated to understand whether the behavioural patterns are changing. The findings suggest that car travel in Brisbane: a) reached a peak in 2003; b) experienced a decline throughout 2003–2012; and c) exhibited a levelling off throughout 2012–2018. The factors contributed to the peak–car phenomenon in Brisbane are both external (global financial crisis, policy interventions in public transport) and a significant change in the coefficients of some internal factors over the periods (millennials, household size, population density).",0965-8564,Not found
Observing gendered interdependent mobility barriers using an ethnographic and time use approach,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.018,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Combining traditional transport research tools with qualitative research methods, particularly ethnography, can contribute to our understanding of the complexity of mobility strategies, particularly their gendered differences. Ethnographic approaches can both explain and disentangle some of the results that emerge from travel and time use surveys, hence providing a more complete picture of how and why these strategies take place, and the barriers people face when moving in the city. Using research-case studies based on in the city of Concepcion, Chile, the paper describes the application of these methods, presenting results which are particularly gender sensitive, as they shed light on the difficulty of understanding mobility strategies as individually decided and conceived, and help to explain how mobility strategies are interdependent and how determinant issues of care are in terms of mobility decision making.",0965-8564,Not found
Trip chain based usage patterns analysis of the round-trip carsharing system: A case study in Beijing,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.017,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"In recent years, the concept of carsharing is rapidly gaining popularity in China, and the round-trip carsharing has become a common mode. However, few studies have revealed the role of round-trip carsharing in users’ travel. In this study, the round-trip GPS data provided by a carsharing company in Beijing, China is used to analyze the users’ usage patterns based on their trip chains. Through the extraction and analysis of trip information, all trip chains are grouped into three clusters, each of which has a different usage pattern. Then the consumption features and the shared car pick-up and return time of these three patterns are discussed. Further, the Bayes’ rule is used to predict the activity purpose, and the proportion and spatial distribution of different purposes are analyzed. Results reveal that the carsharing program presents multiple usage patterns to meet the different travel needs of users. Price incentives like coupons, discounts, and packages can attract more shared car trips. Users' demand for price incentives increases with longer travel distance and time. Also, users’ usage of vehicles and parking spaces has obvious peak hours. The spatial distribution of user activities has distinctly different hotspots. This paper can be beneficial for operators to set a reasonable pricing plan and provide better services.",0965-8564,Not found
Test-riding the driverless bus: Determinants of satisfaction and reuse intention in eight test-track locations,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.013,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The introduction of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) presents a wide range of challenges and uncertainties regarding their general acceptability. Hence, it is essential that transit managers have a good understanding of passenger satisfaction and of their behavioural intentions after experiencing a driverless vehicle trip. To this end, 1,062 face-to-face surveys were conducted following driverless bus trials in eight Catalan (Spain) municipalities. Using a three-step SEM-MIMIC ordinal Probit approach, we seek to identify the heterogeneity in user perceptions and reuse intentions, a novelty in SAV literature. Specifically, we analyse the users’ behavioural intention to repeat a journey without transit support personnel on the bus and when entirely alone, and how willing they are to substitute their regular bus service with a driverless one. Our results confirm that critical incidents affect user satisfaction concerning safety, the latter constituting one of the most critical factors impacting user reuse intention and overall satisfaction. The test-track scenario also affects reuse intention, with university campuses and parks recording better outcomes than city centres and pedestrianized zones. In contrast to outcomes reported for conventional bus systems, higher socioeconomic status is associated with higher levels of satisfaction with driverless vehicles and a stronger reuse intention. Female users are reluctant to ride on driverless buses alone; however, when they are not regular bus users, they express a reluctance to board SAV both without transit support personnel and alone. In high-income municipalities, we find a positive impact on reuse intention. Finally, a higher degree of satisfaction with the regular bus system is positively linked with a better perceived driverless bus experience. For implementation purposes, location, critical incidents, safety, regular bus user satisfaction, technology affinity, and the income level of the municipalities are all aspects that need to be factored-in when designing an adoption strategy.",0965-8564,Not found
An efficient caching policy for content retrieval in autonomous connected vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.005,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Connected vehicles will enable the smart and autonomous transportation systems in the future.

Vehicles will receive traffic and infotainment contents from the city traffic command center using C-V2X communications. In this context, infrastructure Road Side Units (RSUs) will cache urgent and popular data in their memory storage, hence providing vehicles to retrieve information from a closer vicinity at a RSU. In this paper, we present a content caching policy for the connected vehicles operator to improve the efficiency of the content retrieval in terms of download rate and delay. We propose the utility functions for the RSUs and vehicles to cache a particular content at a given RSU. Moreover, Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm is used to efficiently allocate RSU cache to the contents. We also provide rules to update the cache slots. The proposed caching scheme is compared with random caching policy and market matching based caching policies. Results show that the proposed content caching policy improves the efficiency of the content retrieval with 60 % more data transmission with reduced downloading time and better link utilization as compared to other two scheme.",0965-8564,Not found
Examining impacts of time-based pricing strategies in public transportation: A study of Singapore,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.010,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Peak and off-peak pricing strategies are an important policy tool used to spread peak demand in public transportation systems. This study uses an agent-based simulator (SimMobility Mid-term) to examine the impact of pricing (off-peak fare discounts) strategies used in Singapore. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the capabilities of the simulator, and types of detailed performance indicators it can provide, in order to examine the effects of complex public transport pricing policies. Behavioral models within the simulator are calibrated with relevant datasets such as household travel survey, smart card, GPS probe data from taxis and traffic counts for the Singapore network. Nine (09) time-based pricing strategies are examined that consist of a combination of free pre-peak travel on Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and an off-peak discount for integrated transit (public buses, MRT and Light Rail Transit (LRT)). Changes in public transport ridership, mode shares, operator's revenue and denied boarding are used as indicators to examine the impacts of pricing strategies. The effects of these policies are also examined on segments of the population in terms of income level, person type and gender. Results indicate that off-peak discounts spread PM peak demand and attract individuals to public transportation. However, the availability of fare discounts in all off-peak periods results in adverse impacts during the AM peak because many commuters shift the return leg rather than the initial leg of their journey. The study concludes with suggestions on how to explore more effective pricing strategies, i.e. providing fare discounts only during off-peak periods that surround AM peak.",0965-8564,Not found
Promoting considerate parking behavior in dockless bike-sharing: An experimental study,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.006,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Dockless shared bicycles have become a popular mode of transportation for city dwellers in China. Despite its convenience, the dockless feature also creates new challenges, as users often park shared bicycles in a disorderly fashion, which places a burden on both city management and business operations. In a randomized field experiment, subjects receive general information via one of three interventions to improve orderly parking: being informed about the social norm, receiving a warning message, or being offered a monetary incentive. The results suggest that the warning message and monetary incentive shift users’ behavior compared with the social norm intervention. Users who received warning messages were 18.0% more likely to park in an orderly fashion, and users who received a monetary incentive were 25.2% more likely.

Evaluating the systemic effects of automated mobility-on-demand services via large-scale agent-based simulation of auto-dependent prototype cities,10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.013,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The growing demand for urban mobility highlights the need for relevant and sustainable solutions in cities worldwide. Thus, we develop and implement a framework to analyze the systemic impacts of future urban mobility trends and policies. We build on prior work in classifying the world’s cities into 12 urban typologies that represent distinct land-use and behavioral characteristics by introducing a generalized approach for creating a detailed, simulatable prototype city that is representative of a given typology. We then generate and simulate two auto-dependent (largely US-specific) prototype cities via a state-of-the-art agent-based platform, SimMobility, for integrated demand microsimulation and supply mesoscopic simulation. We demonstrate the framework by analyzing the impacts of automated mobility on-demand (AMoD) implementation strategies in the cities based on demand, congestion, energy consumption and emissions outcomes. Our results show that the introduction of AMoD cannibalizes mass transit while increasing vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and congestion. In sprawling auto-dependent cities with low transit penetration, the congestion and energy consumption effects under best-case assumptions are similar regardless of whether AMoD competes with or complements mass transit. In dense auto-dependent cities with moderate transit modeshare, the integration of AMoD with transit yields better outcomes in terms of VKT and congestion. Such cities cannot afford to disinvest in mass transit, as this would result in unsustainable outcomes. Overall, this framework can provide insights into how AMoD can be sustainably harnessed not only in low-density and high-density auto-dependent cities, but also in other typologies.",0965-8564,Not found
Assessing spatial and social dimensions of shared bicycle use in a Southern European island context: The case of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.003,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The 21st century has seen a cycling renaissance across Europe with many cities moving away from the car-centric infrastructure, urban design and planning policies prevalent since the 1950s. Southern European island cities, which exhibit certain characteristics considered as barriers to cycling, such as hot summers and high humidity, hilliness, and car-oriented culture and infrastructure however, have been lagging behind in this resurgence of cycling. Despite this, bicycle sharing systems (BSS) and policies promoting cycling have emerged in this region. These have the potential to provide alternatives for those marginalized by car-based mobility and to reduce traffic related diseases and injuries, noise and air pollution, which can contribute to an improved quality of life for all citizens. Using the coastal city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain) as a case study, the utilization of bike-sharing is investigated through a questionnaire to users of the shared bicycles, as well as through spatial analysis of the BSS trip data. The analysis of the survey, through descriptive and inferential statistics, allows for an understanding of the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the users, and the inter- and intra-personal factors influencing the choice to use a shared bicycle as a mode of transport. Results show that distance to nearest station, money-saving and environmental concerns, satisfaction with the operating system, and provision of safe cycling infrastructure significantly influence BSS use. A regression model is constructed to assess the influence of spatial factors such as land use, socio-economic characteristics and network variables on the use of the BSS. From the regression model it appears that the presence of cycling infrastructure, proximity to a bus station and the density of tourism accommodation, and by proxy, the number of cafes and restaurants, near bicycle sharing stations positively influences frequency of use. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of the BSS in the promotion of cycling and the transition to sustainable and inclusive mobility policies, which are still contested in the car-centric transport system currently dominating the city.",0965-8564,Not found

Recalling the credulousness that attended the arrival of O Bike’s fleet between June 2017 and 2018, this paper gives primacy to considering whether O Bike was ever about bicycles and transport, showing how the scheme aligned itself with hyped discourses of disruption and the sharing economy, whose true beneficiaries were startup entrepreneurs developing platform-based schemes seeking venture capital and unicorn status. In Melbourne, this ‘success’ left the city with hundreds of bicycles in its waterways, and little insight or curiosity about how this was generated by a group of individuals carrying out their professed modus operandi of 2010s tech startup culture, which has no meaningful, enduring relationship with public transport or urban cycling. This re-telling of O Bike’s dispersal and fall in Melbourne seeks to focus attention within transport studies and political geography on docked and dockless public bike schemes to the occluded centrality of venture capital as a key agentic force at work in global cities in the decade just passed. The limit of this re-telling is the utopia of 2010s capitalism: unlimited profit and success without regulation or responsibility. By offering critical counterfactuals from this instantiation of dockless, it encourages policy makers to think more carefully about the value and meaning of ‘sharing’ platforms.",0965-8564,Not found

A growing number of studies have been mining bike-sharing data from different cities to understand bike-sharing systems. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of a bike-sharing network structure. Thus, this paper attempts to use complex network theory and spatial autocorrelation analysis approaches to examine structural properties of bike-sharing systems, quantify the importance of bike stations in the network, and evaluate their spatial clustering patterns. This research analyzes bike-sharing trip data from five different sized bike-sharing systems in the United States, Canada, and China. The results of network analysis reveal that the bike-sharing networks have a small-world property with a small average path length and a high clustering coefficient. Compared with medium-scale networks, the connectivity and accessibility of bike stations are relatively low in the large-scale bike-sharing network. Also, the connectivity of bike stations is positively related to their accessibility while they are not highly correlated with their intermediateness. The spatial clustering analysis results indicate that the spatial distributions of connectivity and accessibility of bike stations have a strong global spatial autocorrelation. Also, the stations with high connectivity and accessibility are concentrated in the urban centers, and the stations with low connectivity and accessibility are clustered in the periphery of the urban areas. However, their intermediateness does not show a strong global spatial clustering pattern, which implies that bike-sharing networks consist of multiple sub-groups. The findings provide new insights for transport planners and managers to understand bike-sharing systems and to improve their service quality.",0965-8564,Not found

However, low-income populations, people of color, and transit-dependent households are not highly representative of the bikeshare user’s profile. Some bikeshare programs in the United States, such as Divvy in Chicago, try to address this equity problem by promoting their systems among low-income communities. Currently, there is limited research estimating bikeshare ridership in these communities and quantitatively analyzing the impacts of financial barriers in disadvantaged areas at the station level. This research fills this gap by analyzing the current utilization of bikeshare systems among disadvantaged populations. The study develops a Negative Binomial regression model to estimate bikeshare ridership using data from Chicago’s bikeshare system. The results show that bikeshare stations in disadvantaged communities generate around two-thirds of the average annual trips across all stations. The employment rate plays an important role in increasing bikeshare ridership, especially for disadvantaged areas. Additionally, the research found that the proportion of trips by annual members is significantly lower in disadvantaged communities than in other areas. However, interestingly, residents in disadvantaged communities tend to make longer bikeshare trips once they are annual members. Their dependence on bikeshare systems may result from accessibility improvement (e.g., work commute by bikeshare). Based on all the findings, we discuss planning implications for more socially inclusive and equitable bikeshare systems.",0965-8564,Not found
Multimodal subsidy design for network capacity flexibility optimization,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.001,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Transportation networks are facing severe congestion due to the increasing burden of traffic demand and unexpected incidents. Therefore enhancing the network capacity flexibility is the urgent task of transportation managers. Apart from the expansion of road links, economic approaches such as congestion pricing are more effective ways of improving network capacity flexibility. However, congestion pricing often receives objection since it brings excessive travel cost to travelers. A more acceptable economic scheme of adjusting route choice behavior might be offering a subsidy, in a manner of reducing existing charges. In light of this incentive, we propose a solution in the form of multimodal subsidy design with the goal of optimizing network capacity flexibility. To validate the general applicability of the proposed multimodal subsidy schemes, we evaluate and quantify the network capacity flexibility by adopting three different measurement approaches, which are based on the concepts of reserve capacity, total capacity flexibility, and limited capacity flexibility respectively. Three mathematical models are established using these different capacity flexibility measurement approaches, each of which is formulated as a bi-level programming problem. The upper-level problem is to optimize the values of various subsidies, including road link subsidies, parking subsidies, and metro ticket subsidies to enhance the network capacity flexibility. The lower-level problem is a nested-logit based variation inequality program that considers multimode traffic and predicts how drivers and passengers react to the subsidy decision delivered from the upper-level problem. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate how the proposed subsidy schemes affect network capacity flexibility as well as to compare the effects of different subsidy schemes.",0965-8564,Not found
The long-haul full-load vehicle routing and truck driver scheduling problem with intermediate stops: An economic impact evaluation of Brazilian policy,10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.021,140,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This paper presents a methodology to identify the economic impact of different policies for heavy vehicle routing and driver scheduling in long-haul full-load trips with intermediate stops for refueling and for regulation-driven meal and rest periods. This methodology can be used both as a planning tool to help policy-makers define policies through scenario simulations, and as an evaluation tool to examine ex-post economic impact once policies have been changed as illustrated herein for the Brazilian case. The paper introduces a mathematical formulation, proposes a state-space graph search approach, and develops an algorithmic solution for a variant of the vehicle routing and truck driver scheduling problem with intermediate stops (VRTDSPIS), which is especially important in countries with vast territory where long-range freight trucking trips are common. In addition, it is particularly relevant for the economies of emerging markets that may have evolving regulatory frameworks and suboptimal infrastructure environments. Regulatory maximum driving and minimum driver resting time windows impose significant constraints to trucker routines, especially in sparsely populated regions through which long range vehicle trips with full load are common. Such trips can take days to be concluded and numerous alternative routes are possible, each with very different alternatives for refueling and rest. While the literature to date has focused mostly on truck driver scheduling given pre-determined routes and individual country’s laws and regulations, this paper proposes a joint solution for the routing and scheduling problem with time window constraints, determining simultaneously a routing and scheduling plan that meets all maximum driving and minimum resting time interval regulatory requirements at minimum cost. An illustration applying the methodology to evaluate the economic impact of truck driver regulatory changes in Brazil is presented.",0965-8564,Not found
Is the London Cycle Hire Scheme becoming more inclusive?

A growing body of evidence suggests that cycle hire schemes tend to serve wealthy areas and young, high income groups, mirroring inequalities in other types of cycling uptake, yet there has been little research into the ‘direction of travel’ and whether such inequalities are growing or ‘levelling up’ over time. This paper explores the uptake of the London Cycle Hire Scheme (LCHS), a large, early and prominent scheme that had the explicit aim of ‘normalising’ cycling. The method involved reproducible analysis (with code documented in the GitHub repo Robinlovelace/cycle-hire-inclusive) of 73.4 million cycle high records spanning 8 years from January 2012 to December 2019, using the geographic location of docking stations alongside official statistics to assess social and spatial inequalities in uptake.

This study uses a dataset of 11.9 million hourly observations from 118 traffic count stations over 2010–2017 to investigate the relationship between gasoline prices and traffic flows in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The findings suggest that higher gasoline prices reduce traffic flows, with an average effect size of −0.04 in the hourly estimates. The elasticity is particularly pronounced during off-peak periods, both on weekdays (−0.10) and weekends (−0.07). In contrast, a positive effect of gasoline prices on traffic flows is observed for peak periods on weekdays (0.06). Evidence is also obtained that afternoon peak-hour speeds are faster when gasoline prices are higher, consistent with a lowering of traffic density. The research also finds a negative price elasticity of gasoline demand and that people are more likely to use public transport when gasoline prices are higher. The findings suggest that fuel excise plays a role in both reducing overall road dependence and alleviating the severity of some peak-hour traffic jams.",0965-8564,Not found

A synthetic population of New York City with a tour-based nested logit mode choice model was developed with accessibility to bikesharing and ride hail services via smartphone ownership. The model results suggest Manhattanites have a value of time of $29/h, consistent with the literature. Smartphone ownership is positively influenced by income and negatively influenced by age, and in turn negatively impacts Citi Bike ridership relative to other modes available.

Towards this, we conducted an intercept survey focusing on the transit trips in the Chicago metropolitan area and analyzed it using latent class modeling approach. Per the results, two classes of transit users could be identified: (1) worthwhileness seekers, productively travelers and (2) leisure seekers, occasional worthwhile travelers. The results also suggest travel time, waiting time and walking distance to the transit station, and the set of in-vehicle activities as significant predictors of worthwhile use of travel time.

Using several land use and transit service datasets, including data collected from the fare box systems onboard the Saskatoon Transit buses, three types of models were tested. These models include ordinary least square models (OLS), spatial lag models (SLM), and spatial error models (SEM). The results from the models suggest that we can more closely predict actual public transit ridership when including a gravity-based accessibility measure in the model, while controlling for several household socioeconomic factors and built environment characteristics. In all cases, the measure that best fit the variation in ridership was the filtered frequency accessibility measure calculated using a 400 m network buffer and a Butterworth filter with a distance decay bandpass value of 250 m. This study offers transit planners and practitioners a better understanding of the performance of different transit local accessibility measures in relationship to actual transit ridership.",0965-8564,Not found
Investigating passenger behavior in airport terminals with multisource data: Recall bias and time budget effects,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.010,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Passenger activities in terminals can be understood better in the current era, when sensors are pervasive throughout airports. This study demonstrated the usefulness of combining multiple-source data to investigate passenger behavior in airports. Objective time-use and terminal activity participation data of 266 air passengers’ behavior at Taipei Songshan International Airport were collected from beacons, a self-developed mobile application, and questionnaires. The study first investigated recall errors generated from self-report questionnaires, an approach commonly used in previous studies with a retrospective design. The study then assessed the participation and duration of terminal activities conducted by passengers with standard, nested, and mixed multiple discrete-continuous extreme value models. The analysis results revealed that recall errors were associated with activity choice and duration and passenger characteristics. These errors were not random but systematic and could potentially lead to biased results in retrospective studies solely based on self-report questionnaires. The estimation results of extreme value models generally confirmed the expected association of terminal activity choice with passenger characteristics, such as more frequent retail store visits in female passengers than in male passengers. However, the associations of passenger characteristics with activity duration could be consistent with or opposite to those with activity choice; for example, frequent flyers tended to consume food and beverages (F&B) more frequently and spend a longer time in restaurants whereas passengers having a long free dwell time were less likely than those having a short free dwell time to consume F&B but the duration was relatively long on average. Managerial implications for airports and retailers and recommendations for future air passenger behavioral studies were provided.",0965-8564,Not found
Does free-floating carsharing reduce private vehicle ownership? The case of SHARE NOW in European cities,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.016,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"During the last decade, the use of free-floating carsharing systems has grown rapidly in urban areas. However, little is known on the effects free-floating carsharing offerings have on car ownership in general. Also the main drivers why free-floating users sell their cars are still rarely analysed. To shed some light on these issues, we carried out an online survey among free-floating carsharing users in 11 European cities and based our analysis on a sample of more than 10,000 survey participants. Our results show that one carsharing car replaces several private cars – in optimistic scenarios up to 20 cars. In Copenhagen (followed by Rome, Hamburg, and London) one carsharing car replaces about two times more private cars than in Madrid, the city with the lowest number. The main non-city specific influencing factor of shedding a private car due to the availability of the free-floating carsharing services seems to be the usage frequency of the service. The more kilometres users drive with these cars, the more likely it becomes that they sell a private car (or they sell their car and, therefore, use this service more often). Further memberships of bikesharing and other carsharing services, users that live in larger buildings as well as users that own several cars are more likely to reduce their number of cars, too. Finally, our findings are highly valuable for carsharing operators and (transport) policy makers when introducing free-floating carsharing systems in further cities. According to our results, all 11 cities show a reduced private car fleet due to members’ access to free-floating carsharing.",0965-8564,Not found
Explanatory variables underlying the route choice decisions of tourists: The case of Geiranger Fjord in Norway,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.023,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The tourism industry is rapidly growing, and the massification of certain areas is jeopardising the environment. Certain roads in protected areas or near tourist attractions are experiencing an increase in traffic volumes, leading to higher pollution and noise levels and greater discomfort in the travel experience. To recommend measures intended to ensure a sustainable tourism industry without compromising the environment, it is necessary to obtain further knowledge regarding tourists' travel behaviour as it may differ from that of other travellers, i.e., tourists might choose a route based on variables other than time and cost, such as landscape or tourist attractions. Using Geiranger Fjord in Norway as a case study, tourist route choice preferences were observed and analysed. In total, 60 routes from 12 different origins were observed based on 408 responses collected through a tourist survey administered in the summer of 2018. These data were combined with information regarding road features and the locations of tourist attractions. A path size correction logit model was selected to estimate the significant variables in the choice of one route over other routes. The results showed that tourists selected their routes mainly based on the travel time, road scenery (water bodies and forests), sightseeing places among first-time visitors, and outdoor activities among those living outside of Norway. In addition, the tourists preferred local roads, and 'caravan' tourists were more attracted to roads with fewer facilities. The findings of this study show that tourists’ route choice behaviour differs from that of other travellers. Policymakers should consider these differences to enhance transport systems. Further research should focus on incorporating these findings into a transport model to simulate tourists' travel patterns and quantify changes in traffic volumes due to different sustainable measures.",0965-8564,Not found
Behavioral response to promotion-based public transport demand management: Longitudinal analysis and implications for optimal promotion design,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.027,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Increasing ridership in the urban rail systems in major cities is outpacing their designed capacity. Promotion based demand management can facilitate better utilization of the available capacity of the existing system when the investment and opportunity to expand the system are limited. While several studies address short-term behavioral responses to such promotions using before and after analysis, how behavioral changes are sustained in the long run is also very important as well as differences in response among different user groups. Using an extensive smart card dataset over two years from Hong Kong’s urban heavy railway system, this paper explores the longitudinal behavior of passengers in response to a promotion aiming at changing passengers’ travel period from peak to the pre-peak. The approach uses customer segmentation to understand the heterogeneous response of different groups. Users who have high flexibility in schedule and familiarity with the system and travel long distances tend to be more likely to change their travel periods to take advantage of the discount. The longitudinal promotion analysis reveals that 35–40% of passengers who initially adopted the promotion will eventually revert to their previous travel time periods. The results suggest that the promotion designs should be adjusted/renewed over time to sustain the initial response given the attrition of early adopters. Based on the behavioral analysis, an ‘optimal’ promotion design approach is applied to examine the effectiveness of promotion strategies given different behavioral responses over time, heterogeneous group behavior, and constraints on the investment budgets and performance requirements. The promotion design using group-specific response can better target price-sensitive users, hence improves its effectiveness over time, while the design based on the average response shows a significant performance decrease. However, the optimal design schemes using different behavioral responses are relatively consistent in terms of the selected stations for promotion, though some differences exist in the discount levels and time periods for the areas where there can be more early morning travelers. From a design perspective, there is not much difference in the promotion effectiveness regardless of the behavioral response assumed for the design.",0965-8564,Not found
A study of relationships in traffic oscillation features based on field experiments,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.006,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Despite numerous theoretical models, only limited field experiments have been conducted to investigate traffic oscillation propagation, and the relationships between traffic oscillation features (e.g., period, speed variation, spacing and headway) have not received quantitative analysis. This study conducts a set of field experiments designed to inspect such relationships. In these experiments, 12 vehicles equipped with high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) devices following one another on public roads, and the lead vehicle was asked to move with designed trajectory profiles incorporating various parameters. Measurements of five features are extracted from processing the field vehicle trajectory data with a time-domain method. Frequency analysis is also proposed with the Fourier transform method to verify the effectiveness of the features measured by the time-domain method. Compared to the frequency-domain method, the time-domain method yields more measurements with comparable quality and is more robust on trajectories with a small number of oscillation cycles. Then, a series of linear regression analyses reveal a number of new findings on the relationships between these features. For example, the time gap between two consecutive vehicles is negatively correlated with the speed standard deviation of the preceding vehicle and the initial speed of the following vehicle. It is also positively correlated with the average speed of the preceding vehicle and the initial spacing. The findings are helpful in constructing new microscopic traffic models better describing traffic oscillation dynamics. To illustrate this benefit, revised car following models are proposed to capture the relationship between time gap and other features. The simulation results show that the revised models yield better prediction accuracy (in range of 18% to 40% with the oscillation experiment dataset and in range of 30–63% with the stationary experiment dataset) than the classical models on reproducing real-world trajectories.",0965-8564,Not found

Statistical evaluation of data requirement for ramp metering performance assessment,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.011,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Ramp metering is known to be an effective freeway control measure that ensures the overall efficiency and safety of a highway system by regulating the inflow traffic on-ramps. Therefore, agencies are required to frequently assess the performance of their ramp meters. However, one major challenge for the agencies conducting ramp metering performance assessments is the lack of knowledge about data requirements. Data requirements consist of the information regarding the duration of data collection for accommodation time (the time needed for the users to get familiar with the change) and for the evaluation time. In this paper, a non-parametric statistic approach is proposed that is robust to the underlying distribution of the random variable. Meaning that the accuracy of the model is insensitive to the data distribution. For validation purposes, three active ramps along State Route 51, in the Phoenix Metropolitan area, Arizona are selected as the case study. ADOT altered their ramp control strategy from fixed-time to responsive control and is attempting to know the extent of data required for assessing its new ramp metering strategy. For this particular case study, the results suggest that two months’ worth of data is the minimum data sufficient for a ramp metering assessment. The proposed assessment approach can be transferred to other ramp metering applications to help traffic engineers efficiently tune up ramp metering strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
Exploring behavioral heterogeneities of metro passenger's travel plan choice under unplanned service disruption with uncertainty,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.009,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Understanding metro passenger’s travel plan choice behavior under unplanned service disruptions is vital for transit agencies. It allows capturing the changes in the demands of the passengers, adopting measures aimed at minimizing the impact on the transit system, and ensuring the safety of the interrupted passengers. Different from planned metro service disruptions, unplanned service disruptions cannot be known in advance and have high uncertainty. However, little is known regarding the role of the uncertain duration in the decision-making process and the taste heterogeneity in the behavior under unplanned metro service disruptions. To fill this gap, we first established a time interval in each scenario of a stated preference questionnaire to indicate the uncertain duration and conducted a web-based survey. Based on the survey data collected at Guangzhou, China, we developed an error component latent class model for travel plan choice behavior considering uncertainty and heterogeneity. The model result showed that the population can be classified into two classes, uncertainty pessimists and uncertainty optimists, who have a strong and weak perception of the uncertainty of the disruption duration, respectively, based on socio-demographic and travel characteristic attributes. Concurrently, the perception of uncertainty in both the classes is enhanced during peak hours and when a passenger enters a station. The findings of this study provide more insights into passenger’s travel behavior under unplanned service disruptions with uncertainty. Moreover, they can assist transit agencies in adopting effective management strategies, which, in turn, will aid in improving the service quality for its passengers.",0965-8564,Not found

Using GMM estimators, we found that all underlying variables influence each other in the long-run. The direction of causal relationship between the variables tended to vary across panels with different levels of significance. The results arising out of empirical analysis imply that transport and logistics infrastructure do contribute to FDI ‘attractiveness’ and sustainable economic growth.

Fare evasion correction for smartcard-based origin-destination matrices,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.008,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Origin-Destination matrices obtained from smartcard data are very valuable because they contain vast amounts of information and can be obtained at a very low cost. However, they can only account for trips paid by smartcard. Trips paid by other means, as well as non-paid trips, must be incorporated using additional information. This paper discusses the biases that are introduced due to fare evasion and presents a sequential method to estimate correction factors due to partial evasion in some trip stages, as well as total fare evasion in all trip stages, using external information regarding trips not registered in the smartcard database. We apply this method to the case of Santiago, Chile, where partial evasion (during a bus trip stage prior to a Metro trip stage) and total evasion (during all bus-only trip stages) are relevant fare evasion situations. Information from the Santiago Metro Origin-Destination survey and from external fare evasion measurements is used. The results indicate a 5% partial evasion rate for bus trip stages prior to Metro trip stages, and a 37% total fare evasion rate for bus-only trips. This paper is a contribution towards establishing new methods to feasibly obtain OD matrices through the adequate merging of automatically-collected data with complementary traditional measurements and survey instruments.",0965-8564,Not found
Ambivalent about travel mode choice? A qualitative investigation of car user and non-car user attitudes,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.012,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Attitudes towards travel mode choice have been regarded as bi-polar evaluations of travel options that remain stable across time and context. Intra-personal attitudes can be variable, becoming more or less salient and changing in strength or valence across decisional contexts. This study draws on theoretical underpinnings of attitudinal ambivalence, which proposes that a person can hold two-dimensional (negative and positive) evaluations about one attitude object simultaneously. The present research aimed to explore attitudinal ambivalence in relation to travel modes and examine the variability of attitudes in different contexts. Thirty semi-structured interviews explored above-average mileage car users’ (n = 15) and non-car users’ (n = 15) experiences of attitudinal ambivalence in relation to various transport modes and under which circumstances. Thematic analysis found support for attitudinal ambivalence and context-dependent attitude variability in relation to travel mode evaluations. Discussions of an a priori questionnaire confirmed the malleability of transport-relevant attitudes. Transport-relevant attitudes are complex and ambivalent. Attitudinal ambivalence and context-dependent attitude variability has implications for transport research design, interventions targeting travel-related attitudes and policies aimed to reduce single-occupancy driving.",0965-8564,Not found
Quantifying the employment accessibility benefits of shared automated vehicle mobility services: Consumer welfare approach using logsums,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.002,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The goal of this study is to assess and quantify the potential employment accessibility benefits of shared-use automated vehicle (AV) mobility service (SAMS) modes across a large diverse metropolitan region considering heterogeneity in the working population. To meet this goal, this study proposes employing a welfare-based (i.e. logsum-based) measure of accessibility, obtained via estimating a hierarchical work destination-commute mode choice model. The employment accessibility logsum measure incorporates the spatial distribution of worker residences and employment opportunities, the attributes of the available commute modes, and the characteristics of individual workers. The study further captures heterogeneity of workers using a latent class analysis (LCA) approach to account for different worker clusters valuing different types of employment opportunities differently, in which the socio-demographic characteristics of workers are the LCA model inputs. The accessibility analysis results in Southern California indicate: (i) the accessibility benefit differences across latent classes are modest but young workers and low-income workers do see higher benefits than high- and middle-income workers; (ii) there are substantial spatial differences in accessibility benefits with workers living in lower density areas benefiting more than workers living in high-density areas; (iii) nearly all the accessibility benefits come from the SAMS-only mode as opposed to the SAMS+Transit mode; and (iv) the SAMS cost per mile assumption significantly impacts the magnitude of the overall employment accessibility benefits.",0965-8564,Not found
Understanding bike-sharing users’ willingness to participate in repairing damaged bicycles: Evidence from China,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.017,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"In the past three years, many studies have been conducted on dockless bike sharing (DBS) around the world. However, these studies have focused minimally on the problem of damaged bicycles, which is critical to a DBS system’s operating efficiency, user satisfaction and platform sustainability. The objectives of this study are to develop an integrated theoreticalframework based on the normative activation model and examining the impact mechanism of users’ willingness to participate in repairing damaged bicycles. To achieve these objectives, a questionnaire survey was undertaken with a total of 633 DBS users from 27 provinces and municipalities in Mainland China. Empirical results confirm that the theoretical framework can provide a strong rationale for the investigation into DBS users’ willingness to participate in repairing damaged bicycles. Furthermore, internal psychological factors (i.e., personal norms, awareness of consequences, and perceived consumer effectiveness) and external intervention factors (i.e., platform incentives and service response efficiency) had positive effects on users’ participation willingness. Nevertheless, information publicity did not play a significantly direct role but indirectly affected the participation willingness through personal norms. Service response efficiency tended to moderate the impacts of personal norms and awareness of consequences on participation willingness. Eventually, some practical approaches to motivating users to participate in repairing damaged bicycles are proposed. This study extends the theory of normative activation model to better understand the behaviors of DBS users who participate in repairing damaged bicycles, and contributes significant theoretical and practical insights to the sustainability of DBS systems.",0965-8564,Not found
Does real-time transit information reduce waiting time? An empirical analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.014,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"A claimed benefit of real-time information (RTI) apps in public transit systems is the reduction of waiting time by allowing passengers to appropriately time their arrivals at transit stops. Although previous research investigated the overall impact of RTI on waiting time, few studies examine the mechanisms underlying these claims, and variations in its effectiveness over time and space. In this paper, we theorize and validate the sources of RTI-based users’ waiting time penalties: reclaimed delay (bus drivers compensating for being behind schedule) and discontinuity delay (an artifact of the update frequency of RTI). We compare two RTI-based strategies – the greedy strategy used by popular trip planning apps and a prudent strategy with an insurance buffer – with non-RTI benchmarks of arbitrary arrival and following the schedule. Using real-time bus location data from a medium-sized US city, we calculate the empirical waiting times and risk of missing a bus for each trip planning strategy. We find that the best RTI strategy, a prudent tactic with an optimized insurance time buffer, performs roughly the same as the simple, follow-the-schedule tactic that does not use RTI. However, relative performance varies over time and space. Moreover, the greedy tactic in common transit apps is the worst strategy, even worse than showing up at a bus stop arbitrarily. These results suggest limitations on claims that RTI reduces public transit waiting times.",0965-8564,Not found
The effects of high-speed rail development on regional equity in China,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.013,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This paper investigates the impacts of high-speed rail (HSR) development on regional equity in China during 2007–2017. The equity in terms of economic output and HSR service is characterized at national, divisional (Eastern, Central, and Western), and provincial levels. The Gini indices associated with prefectures’ gross regional product (GRP) per capita, HSR connectivity and accessibility are measured to assess disparity from different aspects. Instead of measuring the effect of HSR entry by a dummy variable representing the presence of HSR service only, this paper estimates the effects of HSR by various terms regarding the HSR presence, network coverage, service quality, and equity of HSR development. In particular, the HSR network coverage is captured by the number of prefectures connected to HSR. Service quality is characterized by the HSR connectivity (frequency of HSR services) and accessibility (average travel time and economic potential). The frequency and accessibility related metrics are further decomposed into two sub-variables representing the intra- and inter-provincial metrics to differentiate the service availability and travel time between prefectures in a same or different province(s). The influence between neighboring or adjoining provinces on each other’s economic equity is identified by spatial autocorrelation effect. Our main findings include: 1) National equity is gradually improved in terms of both GRP and HSR developments in China between 2007 and 2017; the provinces or divisions with larger GRP tend to be less equitable; 2) The inauguration of HSR has positive correlation with provincial equity; however, the positive effect diminishes with the spread of HSR coverage; 3) HSR accessibility (average travel time and economic potential) has more significant effect on provincial economic equity than frequency; 4) Effects of intra-provincial accessibility and connectivity (HSR service within the province) dominate inter-provincial metrics (services to other provinces); 5) The prosperous and balanced HSR development in neighboring provinces helps promote provincial economic equity of one another.",0965-8564,Not found
"Unraveling the impact of travel time, cost, and transit burdens on commute mode choice for different income and age groups",10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.020,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"It is well known that faster and less-expensive transit systems with shorter walking distances, as well as less transfers, are associated with transit use. In this regard, recent studies have focused on estimating transit’s competitiveness and further suggested possible policy interventions. However, there were not much attention on measuring travel time and cost differences between transit and auto by considering the temporal variability. In addition, only a limited study have focused on the impact of either walking during transfers on mode choice or the stage of walking that most affects mode choice. This paper provides additional insights into the impact of travel time, cost, and transit burdens on commute mode choice based on the analysis in a transit-oriented mega city, Seoul, Korea. Together with the 2016 household travel survey data, we utilize the web-based route guide information to measure time, cost, and transit burdens for both chosen and non-chosen modes. The results reveal that commuters are significantly affected by the travel time and cost difference between modes. Additionally, the results indicate that the odds of driving increases by 4.7% and 24.3% when commuters have to transfer once or more than once, respectively. Also, commuters were mostly disinclined to walk longer distances during transfer and egress. The effect of time, cost, and transit burdens on mode choice also varied by income and age groups, further implying the group of people that should be focused when devising policies to encourage transit use. To conclude, this paper suggests potential levers for transportation policies to trigger modal shifts toward sustainable modes by using advanced data sources that better estimate the travel characteristics by departure time based on a point-to-point travel survey data.",0965-8564,Not found

In particular, we explore the changes in project selection when assembling an optimal project portfolio under a budget constraint. The simulation model includes endogenous land prices and demand for residential land, heterogeneous preferences and wage offers across residents, and spillover mechanisms which affect wage rates in zones.

Does e-shopping for intangible services attenuate the effect of spatial attributes on travel distance and duration?,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.004,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"E-shopping for intangible services (e.g., eating out services, hairdressing, and visits to movie theatres) refers to searching and paying for services online, but it requires e-shoppers to travel to use these services.

As a result, spatial attributes may barely affect the distance and duration of trips resulting from e-shopping for intangible services. The present study used data from 714 valid face-to-face interviews in Beijing, China, to verify this hypothesis. The results showed that e-shoppers were likely to travel farther after purchasing intangible services online. The effect of spatial attributes on the distance of a single trip was largely attenuated due to online purchases of these services, and the effect on the duration was correspondingly weaker to a limited extent. Therefore, spatial interventions aiming to moderate travel distances and durations may not be as effective in the age of online shopping.",0965-8564,Not found

We implemented a survey across several regions with varying policy experience, using representative samples from Canada (n=1,552) and the US state of California (n=484). The survey evaluated respondents’: (1) awareness of each policy, (2) support and opposition for these policies, and (3) associations with personal characteristics. We find that policy awareness is similarly low in all regions, with fewer than 5% mentioning any of the policies in an open-ended question. Once prompted with multiple-choice style questions, stated awareness is higher for a VES (33–53%), followed by a LCFS (19–38%), and then a ZEV mandate (6–17%). In some cases, awareness is higher in regions that actually had a given policy in place, or for a longer period. Support for strong VES and LCFS is similarly high across regions (around 60–80% support) and support for a strong ZEV mandate is lower (34–55% support) – though all have higher support than strong carbon pricing (22–30%). Regression analyses indicate that policy support is most strongly associated with respondent values and trust in government, with only a minor role for demographic factors. Interaction effects indicate that policy support in the province of Quebec and California is associated with a lack of trust in the federal government but greater trust in provincial or state governments.

Motility is assessed through components of personal access, skills and cognitive appropriation and cover: neighborhood mobility qualities, residential access qualities, mobility skills, travel self-confidence, openness to new people and places. Eudemonic well-being is measured using the three aspects of the Self-Determination Theory: autonomy, relatedness and competencies. A tailor made questionnaire was designed to collect the data.

The results show: i) past mobility experiences and aquired travel resources are positively correlated with current perceived motility, ii) mobility skills, travel self-confidence, openness to new people and places are associated with autonomy and environmental mastery, ii) openness to people and places is linked to a higher degree of self-acceptance, iii) mobility skills are positively related to higher personal growth and purpose, iv) access, mobility skills and openness to new people and places is linked to positive relations with others (relatedness).",0965-8564,Not found
A two-stage framework for fair autonomous robot deployment using virtual forces,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.009,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Consider a set of landmarks that are distributed in an emergency scene and each needs a specific number of robots in its vicinity. This paper presents a two-stage framework for deploying robots autonomously for such scenarios. In the first stage, a Two-hop Cooperative Virtual Force Robot Deployment (Two-hop COVER) technique is employed. It expedites the deployment process by establishing a cooperative relationship between robots and neighboring landmarks. Two-hop communication is utilized as well to reduce the deployment time and traveled distance by robots to satisfy the mission requirements and optimize the deployment process. However, in certain scenarios, Two-hop COVER may not achieve full demand satisfaction. Therefore, the second stage, called Trace Fingerprint is invoked to guarantee full satisfaction. Finally, a fairness-aware version of Two-hop COVER is presented to consider scenarios in which the mission requirements are greater than the available resources (i.e. robots) and hence, the fairness-aware approach dispatches robots in proportion to each landmark's need. Extensive simulation experiments have been carried out to assess the performance of the proposed framework. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches considering several performance factors, such as total travelled distance, total exchanged messages, total deployment time, and Jain's fairness index.",0965-8564,Not found
A work-life conflict perspective on telework,10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.007,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Telework has been promoted for decades as one of the traffic demand management policies to alleviate congestion during peak periods and reduce work-related trips, along with other benefits. However, less clear is the role played by life stages (i.e., gender, marital status and parenthood) on telework behavior. This study investigated to which extent telework frequency associated with life stages, and how these associations could be explained based on the work-life conflict perspective. Representative data were obtained from German Microcensus 2010 (N = 188,081 participants). The outcome variable was measured as ordered telework participation levels (i.e., never, infrequently and frequently). After testing for multicollinearity, a zero-inflated ordered probit regression model was applied to assess the associations between telework and family-life stages, while adjusting for individual, household, job-related and environmental characteristics. Results suggest that life stages associate with telework behavior in a complex way. Three patterns have been distinguished. Specifically, irrespective of gender and marital status, parents are less likely to telework compared to those without children. Regarding individuals without children, single individuals are more likely to telework than married ones, and males more likely than females. In contrast, for individuals with children, the partnered parents are more likely to telework than single parents, and females more likely than males. Our findings suggest that as the most important feature in family-life stages, children play a vital role in telework behavior. It not only increases both work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict, but also triggers housework re-division within couples and aggravates gender differences. Policies that support formal childcare resources could relieve the family-to-work conflict and encourage people to work at home.",0965-8564,Not found
Quantifying the ex-post causal impact of differential pricing on commuter trip scheduling in Hong Kong,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.011,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"This paper quantifies the causal impact of differential pricing on the trip-scheduling of regular commuters using the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) in Hong Kong.

We find statistically significant but small effects of the EBD in the form of earlier departure times. Leveraging the granularity of the data, we also allow for the treatment effect to vary over observed travel characteristics.

ICT's impacts on ride-hailing use and individual travel,10.1016/j.tra.2020.08.012,141,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Previous studies have explored the relationships between an individual’s use of information and communication technology (ICT) and their travel. However, these studies often focus on one specific type of travel and have not considered new forms of mobility, such as ride-hailing, that are enabled by greater ICT penetration. This paper focuses on how ICT use impacts an individual’s self-reported travel behavior—including total number of trips, personal miles traveled (PMT), and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in a typical travel day—and ride-hailing use in the past month. Specifically, we investigate whether substitution or complementarity dominates the relationships between ICT use and an individual’s net travel; how ICT impacts individual ride-hailing adoption and frequency of use; and how ride-hailing use is associated with an individual’s overall travel behavior. Using data from the 2017 U.S. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), we estimate a structural equation model that includes a robust set of individual, household, built environment, and travel characteristics, frequency of ICT use, and a hurdle model (two-part regression) of the adoption and frequency of ride-hailing use. Results reveal that greater ICT is not significantly related to the total number of trips that an individual takes, but it does significantly predict higher PMT and VMT. Greater ICT use is positively and substantively correlated with whether or not the individual has used ride-hailing in the past 30 days, but has no significant relationship with the frequency of ride-hailing use with this bounded outcome being controlled for. We further find that an individual’s ride-hailing use has a small negative correlation with their PMT and VMT after controlling for other common factors. Our results indicate the importance of future research examining the mechanisms by which ICT use increases the distance individuals travel and the role that new ICT-enabled modes, such as ride-hailing, play in changing these mechanisms at both the individual and system levels.",0965-8564,Not found

"The role of involvement with public transport in the relationship between service quality, satisfaction and behavioral intentions",10.1016/j.tra.2020.11.006,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Several studies have made manifest that involvement with public transport play a key role in the intentions of its use. However, conflicting models exist in the literature about involvement’s role in the relationship between service quality, satisfaction and behavioral intentions or loyalty. Previous studies suggest all possible roles: antecedent, mediator, moderator and direct effects. A structural equation modeling approach is applied here to further understand the role of involvement with public transport, comparing eight alternative models and using data from a single survey carried out in five European cities (Madrid, Rome, Berlin, Lisbon and London). Later, the study uses a multiple indicators and multiple causes structural equation modeling approach (SEM-MIMIC) to analyze the effect of heterogeneity present in the data over the four constructs considered (service quality, satisfaction, involvement and behavioral intentions). This comprehensive methodological approach provides a number of noteworthy findings, including the empirical verification that satisfaction is a full mediator between service quality and involvement, and involvement is a full mediator between satisfaction and behavioral intentions. The results further suggest that involvement is the factor that contributes most to behavioral intentions or loyalty, followed by service quality perceptions and satisfaction. Lastly, this study demonstrates the relevance of controlling for heterogeneity in users’ perceptions, so as to obtain more robust relations among factors and identify significant differences among market segments, which could prove useful for public transport operators or policy makers.",0965-8564,Not found
Toll roads vs. Public transportation: A study on the acceptance of congestion-calming measures in Madrid,10.1016/j.tra.2020.11.001,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"To relieve road congestion, a variety of transport demand management measures (TDM) have been implemented all over the world. The success of these measures has been found to depend at least partially on users’ perception about them. Several articles have jointly addressed the acceptability of public transport improvement (carrot policies) and road pricing (stick policies). However, these research works have not considered discounts on existing toll roads to relieve congestion on free alternative expressways. The objective of this paper is to study the combined acceptance of different congestion-calming policies at the suburban level, including the promotion of toll roads and measures to foster the use of transit. To that end, a survey was conducted among travelers on a commuting transport corridor in the region of Madrid aimed at exploring their perceptions towards four TDM measures, and a choice modeling framework was conducted. The scenarios considered are “carrot” policies, and the results of the analysis indicate that enhancing public transportation enjoys more support among respondents than toll promotions. Motorists using the free highway are more willing to use transit improvements than to opt for a toll road as an alternative regardless of the proposed toll discounts. Among the TDM measures explored, the least supported is the promotion of toll discounts associated with non-household carpooling. Furthermore, according to the results, the adoption of these TDM measures is more influenced by trip-related factors, in particular, the trip frequency and the mode of transport, than by socio-economic characteristics of the traveler. Finally, some geodemographic attributes of the residential location are also found to be statistically significant.",0965-8564,Not found
Assessing the magnitude of freight traffic generated by office deliveries,10.1016/j.tra.2020.11.003,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"This paper studies the impact of offices on urban freight traffic. Research on freight activity generated by offices is very limited because they are not seen as important contributors to urban freight traffic, and because the amount of deliveries per office is very small compared to the number of deliveries per establishment in freight-intensive sectors (e.g., retail, wholesale, manufacturing). However, the number of offices in cities is so large that altogether they represent a significant share of urban deliveries and generate a nonnegligible share of urban freight traffic. Hence, the relevance of quantifying their freight trip generation. This paper uses the City of Stockholm as a case study.

The results show that offices represent 36% of establishments in Stockholm, 62% of employees and are responsible for 15% of freight trips generated in the city.",0965-8564,Not found
An empirical analysis and policy implications of work tours utilizing public transit,10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.018,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"We analyze the complex travel behavior of workers who utilize public transit as part of their work tours (“transit commuters”). Here, complex travel behavior is defined in terms of tours, where a tour is defined as a sequence of trips and activities that begins and ends at the same location and a work tour contains at least one non-home, work activity. The objective of this study is to investigate how transit commuters link non-work activities as part of work tours under transit operational constraints. In particular, we identify dominant patterns of work tours made by transit commuters and analyze these tours using a set of activity-travel analytics and data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). The primary insights are: (1) about 80 percent of work tours consist of 7 dominant patterns whereas the remaining 20 percent of tours demonstrate a total of 106 diverse and more complicated patterns; (2) half of the transit work tours are complex; (3) most simple tours are transit-only tours whereas most complex tours are multi-modal tours; and (4) transit use is more complex than the traditional home to work commute with a diverse set of choices at various stages of activity scheduling. While policies associated with public transit typically focus only on the journey to work, this study considers the complete set of trips starting and ending at home including intermediate non-work activity, which can provide insights for land use and transit-related policies to better accommodate the complex travel behavior of commuters who utilize transit.",0965-8564,Not found

In the presence of high density and complex missions, collision avoidance among swarm of drones and with environment obstacles becomes a challenging task and indispensable. This paper aims to enhance the optimality and rapidity of three dimensional IoD path generation by improving the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The improvements include using chaos map logic to initialize the population of PSO. Also, adaptive mutation is utilized to balance local and global search. Then, the inactive particles are replaced by new fresh particles to push the solution toward global optimal. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulation is carried out and the results are compared with slandered PSO and with recent work CIPSO.

Pedestrian crossing design and analysis for symmetric intersections: Efficiency and safety,10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.012,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Traffic engineers are making efforts to mitigate congestion and to improve efficiency at intersections. The symmetric intersection (SI) can increase the capacity of intersections and is economical, practical, efficient and convenient. The pedestrians’ crossing patterns tailored for SI has not yet been studied. This paper not only develops three pedestrian crossing patterns but also analyzes crossing patterns from the aspects of efficiency and safety. For efficiency, delay models are proposed by considering through and diagonal pedestrian movements. For safety, exposure conflicts and the number of potential traffic accidents are analyzed. Then delay and potential accidents are converted into money value respectively and the total cost is calculated. The case study results show that SI performs better in terms of increasing capacity and decreasing pedestrian delay compared with conventional intersection. Crossing pattern 1 is efficient but unsafe while the total delay and safety cost of pattern 3 is usually the highest. The sensitivity analysis indicates that cycle length has a negative impact on average pedestrian cost and if critical flow ratio increases, the average pedestrian cost of pattern 1 and pattern 3 will increase and decrease respectively. Furthermore, the best pedestrian pattern choice under different values of cost per accident and cost of pedestrian delay is also studied.",0965-8564,Not found
Customers’ preferences for freight service attributes of China Railway Express,10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.019,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"China Railway Express (CRE) is one of the most important constituent parts of the Belt and Road Initiative. Freight demand analysis is fundamental as a basis for the operational strategy of CRE and the investment policy along the CRE-routes. Most of the existing relevant literature has focused on the organization of the train operations of CRE, with little research related to demand analysis. This paper contributes to filling this gap by estimating customers’ demand preferences for rail freight service attributes, by using a novel multi-criteria decision-analysis (MCDA) method namely Best-Worst Method (BWM). To this end, a BWM survey was conducted in China to capture customers’ preferences for the main attributes that define the transport service offered by CRE. Two variants of BWM, the linear and the Bayesian, are employed for the analysis. Reliability is suggested as the most important attribute for CRE to focus on, to gain customers. We also conduct a cluster analysis based on the results, which helps the CRE operator to identify homogeneous customer segments, and to optimize the use of CRE’s resources with a differentiated pricing strategy.",0965-8564,Not found
Importance – Performance Analysis (IPA) of bus service attributes: A case study in a developing country,10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.020,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Ensuring a high level of customer satisfaction with public transport is a key objective for transit agencies wishing to maintain and/or increase service uptake. Importance – Performance Analysis (IPA) can be used to identify gaps in the performance of public transport service attributes relative to their importance. However, this approach is often used without adequate consideration of its validity or reliability. Using a case study of bus services in Tehran, Iran, this paper contributes to the literature by improving the validity and reliability of IPA through: incorporating Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify key components of bus service attributes, proposing a method for prioritising attributes, introducing confidence intervals around each attribute to aid in the interpretation of results, and dividing the sample using Cluster Analysis (CA) to mitigate the effects of heterogeneity on the results. The performance and importance of 15 different bus service attributes was assessed through a survey of 390 bus passengers conducted at six high-traffic bus terminals in Tehran. EFA results showed that the bus attributes could be represented by four key components: convenience, comfort, reliability and security. CA results classified the sample into three clusters based on socio-demographic and bus travel characteristics. IPA results indicated that transit agencies and policy-makers need to give greater attention to improving comfort related attributes of bus services in Tehran such as ventilation, cleanliness of buses, and providing facilities for elderly/disabled people. The enhanced approach to IPA developed in this paper can be applied to other jursidictions where agencies are seeking to identify areas to improve public transport customer satisfaction.",0965-8564,Not found
Monte-Carlo optimization model for dynamic capital structure adjustment in Chinese public-private partnerships under revenue uncertainty,10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.010,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"In the case of revenue uncertainty, the static capital structure predefined in the feasibility stage of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) cannot satisfy the need of dynamic adjustment in the capital structure of Chinese PPPs during project operation, thus deteriorating project financial viability in the long run. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a Monte-Carlo optimization model that can enhance the requirement of the dynamic capital structure of PPPs in the uncertain environment regarding the Chinese bridge sector. By quantifying the adjustment cost derived from changes in equity and debt, the proposed model can make a comparison analysis of dynamic capital structures of a specific project in different scenarios with three capital structure adjustment strategies adopted, respectively. In particular, the before-and-after effects and effectiveness derived from the use of government subsidies, capital market financing, and debt financing in adjusting capital structures of a PPP project, respectively, can be compared and evaluated. Based on historic data of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge (HBB) case, the imbalanced roles of the three strategies are unveiled that the strategy of government subsidies has a stronger effect as compared with the other two strategies, thereby enhancing project financial viability and sustainability. The simulation results of the HBB case further indicate that the debt financing strategy, which is the actual strategy applied to HBB can alleviate the short-term project operation pressure, but it may affect the project revenue in the long term, and aggravate the repayment risk of the project. These analyses have uncovered the strategic role of dynamic capital structure in maintaining financial viability and avoiding project bankruptcy. This model fills a gap when we need to deal with changes through dynamic capital structures in PPP projects. Several policy implications are provided in the end for transport PPP projects to improve the survival of PPPs during project operation under revenue uncertainty.",0965-8564,Not found
Determining an efficient and precise choice set for public transport based on tracking data,10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.013,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"To understand the route choices of public transport users, it is important to know the information available to them, and the context present at that moment. In fact, each choice situation in a transport network has different characteristics and possibilities, also depending on the current status of the transport network. In this regard, travel diaries based on tracking technologies can capture precise observations for a long term. In this work, we exploit a large-scale tracking dataset, collected through a mode detection algorithm, to understand route choices of public transport users. We propose a choice set generation algorithm, able to cover more than 94% of the collected trips without any computational constraint. We compare the users’ paths in the public transport network with different choice sets, under multiple performance indicators, including coverage, size, and fit. This latter is computed by the estimation of a Path Size Logit model. The use of Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data allows comparing the available paths in terms of public transport vehicles used. We also consider different information provisions of network conditions and disturbances (full knowledge, no knowledge and current knowledge), and study which information provision best represents the choice set inferred by the observed users’ behaviour. Estimating a Mixed Path Size Logit model, we identified high heterogeneity among the users in only a few aspects. Overall, a condition of no knowledge results as the best fit, i.e. users seem to take into account in a minor way the realized delays in the alternatives considered when deciding their public transport route.",0965-8564,Not found

The unbalanced data spans 1978–2016, with the full 39 years of data for 36 countries. In addition, our dynamic panel estimates address nonstationarity, heterogeneity, and cross-sectional dependence. The OECD panel price elasticity for gasoline is around −0.7 or about three times that for the non-OECD panel; whereas, the OECD price elasticity for diesel is only modestly larger (in absolute terms) than the non-OECD elasticity (−0.3 and −0.2, respectively). For gasoline, the non-OECD GDP elasticity is around 1.0 or about twice that for OECD countries. For the OECD panel, the diesel GDP elasticity is about three times that of the OECD GDP elasticity for gasoline; whereas, for the non-OECD panel, the two GDP elasticities (for gasoline and diesel) are about the same. For non-OECD countries, subpanels based on geography and income produced mostly similar results. We found no evidence of GDP or price asymmetric effects for the 1978–2016 period. Lastly, the large (at least for the OECD panel) and statistically significant transportation price elasticities reported here provide stark contrast to the economy-wide energy price elasticities calculated in Liddle and Huntington (2020a).",0965-8564,Not found
Value of convenience for taxi trips in New York City,10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.016,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"The alternative public transportation options such as subway, bus, or taxis compete with each other to attract passengers. The competition depends on many factors such as travel time, reliability and convenience. Convenience is a collection of attributes affecting the attractiveness of the service including access and egress easiness, service frequency, crowding, comfort and information availability. It can be argued that the taxi preference when there is viable public transportation option is associated with the perceived convenience of taxis. The objective of this study is to evaluate the value associated with convenience of taxis in New York City by utilizing the large taxi trip data. First, the taxi trips which could be replaced by subway without any access or service availability issues (e.g., no transfers between subway lines) are extracted. Then, a multilevel modeling approach was utilized to estimate the monetary value associated with taxi convenience were estimated for different day-of-week and time-of-day periods, and areas in Manhattan. The results show that the value of convenience varies depending on the ratio of taxi travel time to subway travel time, and occasionally intersect when the ratio is close to 1. Furthermore, the corresponding value of convenience (VC) at those points (i.e., taxi travel time is equal to subway travel time) is close to $32/hr for all the zones during weekdays and weekends. Results also indicate that value of time is generally higher at peak hours during weekdays, whereas it is lower during weekend and social period at night and early morning hours.",0965-8564,Not found

Ships navigating in the Arctic may face two main accident scenarios, i.e., getting stuck in the ice and ship-ice collision. More specifically, excessive speed may cause severe hull damage, while a very low speed may lead to a high probability of getting stuck in the ice. Based on this multi-risk perspective, an integrated risk assessment model was proposed to obtain the overall risk using the Bayesian Network (BN), in which the probabilities of accident occurrence and the severities of the possible consequences for ships getting stuck in the ice and for ship-ice collision could be estimated. Then, the voyage data collected from Yong Sheng’s Arctic sailing in 2013 were inputted into the integrated risk assessment model to perform a case study. A sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the proposed model and reveal the inherent mechanisms behind these two accidental scenarios. The proposed model can be applied to identify the safe speed for Arctic navigation under various ice conditions, a duty that is traditionally performed by well-trained crew members, but which entails too many uncertainties.

Are air travellers willing to pay for reducing or offsetting carbon emissions? Evidence from Italy,10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.014,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"The aviation industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors in producing carbon emissions. In order to reduce its carbon footprint and to respond to the increasing number of people concerned about the impact caused by air transport on climate change, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has recently passed the “carbon neutral growth from 2020” resolution requiring that the global net CO2 emissions from international aviation do not exceed the 2019–2020 levels. Airlines, however, can act beyond their obligations under the ICAO resolution investing in projects aimed at reducing or offsetting all the emissions produced not only by their international flights but also by their domestic flights. The aim of this paper is to test whether Italian air travellers would be willing to donate a contribution to finance these projects and whether the willingness to pay depends on the projects’ type and on the projects’ effectiveness. To this aim we performed a stated-choice experiment involving a sample of 1228 Italians who travelled by plane at least once in the last 3 years. We find that their willingness to pay ranges from €12 to €38 per ton and from €14 to €66 per flight. The description of the project type to be financed via the passengers’ donations is one of the most important factors influencing their willingness to pay. Other key factors are the quantity of CO2 reduced or offset via the project and the respondents’ gender, education degree, occupational status, environmental consciousness and travel habits. Our results are useful for airlines to design the donation proposals and improve the corporate image and for policy makers to support air travellers’ environmental conscious behaviour and airlines’ environmental sustainable strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
The spatial distribution and determinants of China's high-speed train services,10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.009,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"China is now a global leader in the construction of high-speed railways (HSRs). However, few studies have focused on the actual operational performance of China’s HSR system, which is revealed by high-speed train (HST) services. This paper investigates the spatial distribution of China’s HST services, and the influencing factors are analyzed by using multiple stepwise regression. The results indicate that the total HST services in China have sharply increased in a short period, but there are significant disparities in HST services available to different regions and cities. At the regional level, Central and East China and China’s major urban agglomerations have received more HST services, while the HST services in West China have achieved faster growth. At the city level, most cities in the southeastern coastal provinces and middle reaches of the Yangtze River have received more services, largely due to the highly developed HSR infrastructure network there. The results of the stepwise regression show that the dominant factors in HST service allocation in China vary greatly at different spatial levels and in different regions. At the national level, the urban socio-economic performance and nature of the HSR infrastructure has a significant impact on the distribution of HST services. Additionally, at the regional level, the primary determinants of HST service allocation vary across regions, which are closely associated with the disparity in socio-economic development and the HST extension stages in different regions.",0965-8564,Not found

Categorization of pedestrian level of service perceptions and accounting its response heterogeneity and latent correlation on travel decisions,10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.011,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"User perception plays a critical role in pedestrian infrastructure usage. Indeed, the perceptional influence varies across individuals, and it is imperative to consider their response heterogeneity in modelling individual travel intentions. The present study develops a novel framework to understand the pedestrian perception, and further identify their impact on future travel decisions. In this framework, the individual pedestrian perception of an area is captured using a Level of Service (LOS) index, and the overall set of LOS is categorized using a clustering methodology. The future travel behavior is modelled using a single-step estimation that incorporates the effect of both response heterogeneity and latent individual correlation. The proposed framework is utilized in estimating the LOS categorization and the future willingness to walk in the city of Coimbatore, India. The results found a significant response heterogeneity among respondents in Coimbatore, and consequently emphasized the need for incorporating these taste variations in the travel behavior models. An increase in LOS encouraged the respondents to walk, and further, walk longer. Moreover, females were willing to pursue walking and/or walk more distance compared with males. The positive ordinal interval for LOS ‘A’ to ‘C’ indicated an acceptability for this LOS range among pedestrians compared with LOS ‘E’ to ‘F’ having a negative range. In the individual assessment of LOS variables, almost all study areas were found requiring an improvement with respect to the management of footpath vendors and footpath cleanliness.",0965-8564,Not found
"Positive, negative, ambivalent, or indifferent? Exploring the structure of public attitudes toward self-driving vehicles on public roads",10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.008,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"We explored the structure of public attitudes on whether self-driving vehicles (SDVs) should be allowed on public roads, through a four-way typology of attitudes (positive, negative, ambivalent, and indifferent). We segmented participants based on a single item, according to which participants allocated themselves to one of the four attitudinal groups, and characterized the demographic and psychological profiles of the four groups in a paper-and-pencil survey in Tianjin, China (N = 816). Nearly half of the participants were in the ambivalent group, followed by the positive group, with these two groups comprising 82% of the sample. Compared to the ambivalent group, the positive group had more participants who had heard of SDVs, more males, higher income, and more licensed drivers. The positive, negative, and two middle groups (ambivalent and indifferent) differed significantly on benefit and risk perceptions, whereas the two middle groups did not differ on benefit and risk perceptions, ambivalence, or interest in SDVs. These four groups clearly differed on two behavioral components of attitude, behavioral intention and willingness to pay. Their rank (from highest to lowest) was positive, ambivalent, indifferent, and negative, for both behavioral components. The findings offer novel insights into the complex structure of public attitudes toward SDVs.",0965-8564,Not found
Impacts of high-speed rail on domestic air cargo traffic in China,10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.002,142,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Air cargo is vital to the modern supply chain because it provides efficient and timely delivery. In the past decade, the development of high-speed rail (HSR) in China has resulted in significant impacts on air cargo traffic, which has long been neglected by the existing studies. In this research, we quantify such impacts using HSR entry dummy variables and employ a panel regression approach to capture the impacts, specifically, the impacts on air cargo volumes and flight frequencies. We conduct a case study using quarterly air cargo traffic data in China, which contains 321 city pairs and spans between January 2011 and December 2017. We separately analyze the impacts on belly-hold cargo (carried by combi or passenger aircraft) traffic and freighter cargo (carried by freighters) traffic. We first capture the general impacts on belly-hold cargo traffic and freighter cargo traffic for all city pairs. Then, to quantify the distance level impacts on belly-hold cargo traffic, we categorize city pairs into multiple groups according to their distance and apply the panel regression approach in each group. Our main results include: (1) The entry of HSR services reduces the belly-hold cargo volumes and flight frequencies by 21.9% and 19.4%, respectively; (2) The strongest impacts on belly-hold cargo volumes and flight frequencies are observed in the medium-haul group within a distance of 800–1300 km; (3) After the entry of HSR services, the cargo volumes and flight frequencies of freighter cargo generally increase by 22.3% and 20.9%, respectively; (4) The whole air cargo traffic in the measurement of cargo volumes and flight frequencies decreases after the entry of HSR, and the impacts on whole air cargo volumes are relatively smaller than the belly-hold cargo volumes in the short-haul (no more than 800 km) and long-haul (more than 1300 km) groups.",0965-8564,Not found

Understanding spatial spillover effects of airports on economic development: New evidence from China's hub airports,10.1016/j.tra.2020.11.013,143,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Many studies have been conducted to examine the direct effects of airports on local economic development, however, there is little solid evidence on spatial spillover effects and much less in the context of China’s airport system. To fill this gap, this paper analyses the spatial spillover effects of China's main hub airports on economic development. Our results indicate that air passenger traffic, air cargo shipment, and flight frequency can induce more positive and larger spillover effects to all other neighboring cities connected through airport network contrast to the direct effects. With other things being equal, increasing flight frequency of existing air services has a greater impact on GDP compared with expanding air services to new destinations. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting new evidence on the spatial spillover effects of airports on economic development in Chinese cities.",0965-8564,Not found
Freight mode choice: Results from a nationwide qualitative and quantitative research effort,10.1016/j.tra.2020.11.016,143,2021-01-01,2021,1,"The research reported in this paper focused on studying various aspects of freight mode choice in the continental United States (US) including the influencing factors, the development of econometric models to assess the impacts of public-sector policies and changes in market conditions. To gain insight into this complex subject, the team used qualitative and quantitative research techniques. The qualitative effort involved In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with a highly selective group of leading shippers, carriers, and receivers. The IDIs provided insight into the key factors that influence mode choice, and the barriers that limit mode shifts. The quantitative effort estimated econometric models that express freight mode choice as a function of key independent variables. A unique aspect of this research is that the models were estimated using high-quality confidential data under the custody of the United States’ Census Bureau, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Surface Transportation Board, including: the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS), the largest shipper survey in the world; the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), a comprehensive registry of commercial establishments in the US; and the Waybill Sample, a 5% sample; together with custom-made datasets of modal characteristics prepared by the authors. Using these data, the team estimated discrete-continuous freight mode choice models representing the choice of rail or truck for 42 different commodity types, and different combinations of independent variables and weighting schemes.

Parking space for shared automated vehicles: How less can be more,10.1016/j.tra.2020.11.008,143,2021-01-01,2021,1,"With the anticipated introduction of self-driving vehicles, new challenges arise for urban transport- and planning authorities. This study contributes to the efforts of formulating the potential opportunities and threats stemming from the introduction of larger fleets of self-driving vehicles to our cities, and what action could be taken by transport authorities to shape this introduction beneficially. In particular, the focus is put on the impact different parking management strategies can have on the performance of a fleet of shared automated vehicles providing on-demand transport services. This analysis focuses on aspects of service efficiency, externalities and service provision equity. The selected parking management strategies are tested in a large-scale activity-based simulation of a case study based on the city of Amsterdam, in which the parking facilities for SAV are digitally mapped throughout the city for different parking scenarios. The vehicles of the fleet aim at relocating to zones with high future demand, which can lead to bunching of vehicles at demand-hotspots. Parking management in the form of restricting parking facilities forces idle vehicles to spread out more evenly in the network. We show that this can reduce average passenger waiting times, increase service provision equity, cause less congestion and even can reduce the necessary fleet size. However, this comes at the cost of an increase in vehicle-kilometres-travelled, which reduces fleet efficiency and causes more undesired service externalities. Parking management is thus a simple, yet effective way for transport authorities to (a) determine where idle self-driving vehicles operating an on-demand transport service will be parked and (b) influence the performance of said transport service.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact of weather on freeway origin-destination volume in China,10.1016/j.tra.2020.11.007,143,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Existing literature has confirmed that severe weather events have a negative impact on travel behavior. Considering the features of long distances and long durations, intercity travel may be affected by the weather at the origin (O) point and at the destination (D) point. This paper aims to reveal the relationship between weather and OD volume of intercity travel by additional considerations of the weather difference between OD points and the lagging effect of various severe weather conditions. Travel data from toll collection system of freeway network in Shandong Province of China is extracted to investigate the weather effect on intercity travel demand. Three types of real-time weather variables (continuous variables of basic weather, dummy variables of severe weather, and weather difference variables between OD points) and two types of non-real-time weather variables (lagging variables and advance variables of severe weather) are combined to systematically analyze the weather effect. The results show that, temperature value and wind speed have no significant impact on intercity travel. Hot day, cold day, foggy day, strong breeze, heavy rain, rainfall, snowfall and visibility have significant impacts on freeway OD volume. Among these weather events, fog, heavy rain and snow usually have the most severe impact. Except for the weather at the O point, the differences in rainfall and snowfall between OD points have significant impacts on intercity travel demand, while the differences in temperature, wind speed, visibility between OD points do not. In addition, snow and heavy rain have the lagging and advance effects on freeway OD volume. The advance effect of snow and heavy rain lasts for one day and the lagging effect lasts for two days. Intercity travel demand is very sensitive to adverse weather on weekend days and during the afternoon. Comparative analysis of multiple OD pairs indicates that intercity travelers with less relevant experience are more sensitive to adverse weather. Findings from the paper will provide transport institutions with a practical guide for systematically investigating the weather effect on intercity travel demand. It can be applied in the intelligent transportation system to provide long-distance travelers with more accurate weather information and traffic guidance services.",0965-8564,Not found
Diffusion of public bicycle systems: Investigating influences of users’ perceived risk and switching intention,10.1016/j.tra.2020.11.002,143,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Public bicycles have been touted as a convenient, environmentally friendly, and sustainable travel mode. Public bicycles have also been viewed as one part of a holistic solution to reducing negative transportation externalities. However, government and private entities need a better understanding of factors influencing user adoption of public bicycle systems. In this survey study, 470 prospective public bicycle users from Beijing, China completed face-to-face and web-based surveys, providing their perceptions of public bicycle system attributes, perceived risk associated with public bicycle use, and their intention to switch to public bicycles as a new mode of transportation. Our findings suggest that switching intention is directly influenced by user perceptions of the risk of public bicycle use, as well as user perceptions of the system’s relative advantage over other modes of transportation and perceived compatibility of public bicycles with the user’s current travel habits. Moreover, perceptions of risk are found to mediate the relationship between system attributes (complexity and observability) and switching intention. That is, user perceptions that public bicycles are difficult to access and use increases perceived risk and reduces the likelihood they will switch to public bicycles as a mode of transportation. Moreover, when prospective users can observe others using the system, their perceptions of risk decrease, which increases the likelihood they will adopt public bicycles as a new mode of transportation. This research contributes to theory-building in public bicycle adoption and informs business and government leaders on how to promote public bicycle adoption through an increased focus on important public bicycle system attributes.",0965-8564,Not found

One popular strategy consists in setting up Low Emission Zones (LEZs) that regulate or restrict the access to a dedicated urban area, for different classes of polluting vehicles. While LEZs are growing in numbers, there is a lack of objective evidence on when and how they actually contribute in reducing air pollution. The main objective of this paper is to show how different LEZ setups lead to different impacts on air pollution. To do so, we use a conceptual framework based on simulated traffic data and behavioral hypotheses. Our analysis highlights that the impact of LEZ on air pollution does not only depend on the severity of the operational rules, but also on its interaction with the behavior adopted by road users, and calls for ex ante considerations of these aspects before establishing the LEZ.",0965-8564,Not found

Even though the policy has been effective in reducing the growing levels of congestion in several cities by curbing the indiscriminate use of the car, it still faces an initial rejection among the population in general. We discuss this issue based on a comprehensive review and set out to define what could be an acceptable road pricing scheme for Santiago de Chile. For this purpose, we estimated a hybrid discrete choice model that allowed us to segment the population according to their attitudes toward the measure. The preferred road pricing scheme in Santiago would charge only for entrance to the smallest of three cordons, around the historic centre of the city, during either the morning (or morning and evening) rush hours, provided that revenues were used to enhance public transport in the city. Since this is different from the best technical solution, which would imply charging in the largest cordon area, we suggest testing the preferred scheme in a pilot trial, following international recommendations and successful previous cases.",0965-8564,Not found
Characterizing the motivational mechanism behind taxi driver's adoption of electric vehicles for living: Insights from China,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.001,144,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Replacing combustion vehicles with electric vehicles has been promoted by the Chinese government as a viable policy to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of this study is to examine factors that influence Chinese taxi drivers’ adoption of electric vehicles for living. This study takes the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) as the theoretical framework and extends it to examine the influence of taxi drivers’ satisfaction over government’s invectives on their adoption of electric vehicles for living (i.e., adoption intention and use behavior). A questionnaire-based survey was conducted in Shenzhen and Guangzhou from November 2018 to April 2019, and 725 valid samples were collected. The model has good explanatory power, and its predictive validity accounts for about 89% of the variance in adoption intention and 50% in use behavior. The statistical results supported that such constructs as Satisfaction with Incentive Policies, Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Conditions, Hedonic Motivation, Price Value, and Habit, are influencing factors on taxi drivers’ intention of using electric vehicles (i.e., behavior intention). These constructs, together with Social Influence but excluding Habit, are also influential to the actual use of electric vehicles by taxi drivers for living (i.e., use behavior). This study expands the existing theoretical modeling for characterizing the adoption of electrical vehicles. The study suggests policy makers further investigate taxi driver's satisfaction with different incentive policies, and electric vehicle manufacturers focus on improving hedonic motivation for taxi drivers, e.g., providing test-drive experiences.",0965-8564,Not found
An equity-based transport network criticality analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2020.12.013,144,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Transport network criticality analyses aim at identifying important segments in a transport network. Such studies are often based on the utilitarian principle, where the criticality of a segment is assessed based on its contribution to the aggregate performance of the transport system. To allow for the use of alternative moral principles, I systematically operationalize concepts from the transport equity literature into an equity-based criticality analysis framework. There are two main ideas in this framework: calculation of equity-weighted transport demand based on distributive moral principles and adaptation of an equity-weighted user equilibrium assignment algorithm. Using the Bangladesh freight transport network as a case study, I show that different sets of transport segments emerge as being critical when different moral principles are used. The use of some pairs of moral principles, for example global equalization and proportionality, even produces a negative ranking correlation. This implies that links which are considered to be critical based on one principle are not at all critical based on the other one. Selection of a moral principle, either explicitly or implicitly, is an inevitable step in transport network criticality analysis. Hence, it is advised to use multiple moral principles or to make a deliberative selection of a moral principle, as considering alternative moral principles in a criticality analysis could expose previously overlooked transport segments.",0965-8564,Not found
Reflecting on forty years contextual evolution of arctic port research: The past and now,10.1016/j.tra.2020.12.001,144,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Despite its political, regulatory, technical, and environmental challenges , the recent trend of ice melting in the Arctic region has caused the increase in international shipping activities. Accordingly, this is supported by research focusing on a wide variety of shipping issues in the Arctic. Surprisingly, this is not the case in Arctic port research. That being said, considering the role of ports in the development of maritime transportation and recent activities in the Arctic, it was critical to map academic and managerial implications of the research in such a terrain. In doing so, this study focused on research articles which addressed the subject since 1980. Through a systematic analysis, the spatial scale (i.e., foreland and maritime space (global), hinterland (regional/national), and port (local) scales), and functional perspective (i.e., space- related (locational), activity-related (operational) and consequence-related (impact) perspectives) of 38 representative articles were extracted and used. The findings suggest that, despite the historic similarity between Arctic shipping and Arctic port research, there was a widening gap between such trends in the last ten years, and at the same time, the contribution of Arctic port articles was very limited. Over the past years, the order of impact of Arctic port research was that the consequence-related global scale issues were highest followed by regional/national and local scales respectively. This was in contrast to port research, in which activity- related local scale research ranked the highest. Also, a comparison of research between Northern Sea Route (NSR) and the North West Passage (NWP) was carried out to understand the attitude of infrastructure holders along those routes. Investigation revealed that more than 70% of research was conducted on the NSR.

As a new form of ridesharing services, ridesplitting has rarely been studied. Based on the Chicago ridesourcing trip data, this study explores how ridesplitting adoption rate (i.e., the proportion of ridesourcing trips with ridesharing authorization) varies across space and what factors are associated with these variations. We find large variations in ridesplitting adoption rates across neighborhoods (Census Tracts) and across origin–destination (Census-Tract-to-Census-Tract) pairs. Particularly, the ridesplitting adoption rate is low for airport rides. We further apply a random forest model to explore which factors are key predictors of ridesplitting adoption rate across O-D pairs and to explore their nonlinear associations. The results suggest that the socioeconomic and demographic variables collectively contribute to 68.60% of the predictive power of the model, but travel-cost variables and built-environment-related factors are also important. The most important variables associated with ridesplitting adoption are ethnic composition, median household income, education level, trip distance, and neighborhood density. We further examine the nonlinear association between neighborhood ridesplitting adoption rate and several key variables such as the percentage of white population, median household income, and neighborhood Walk Score. The revealed nonlinear patterns can help transportation professionals identify neighborhoods with the greatest potential to promote ridesplitting.",0965-8564,Not found
Quantifying economic benefits from free-floating bike-sharing systems: A trip-level inference approach and city-scale analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2020.12.009,144,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Despite many qualitative discussions about the benefits of free-floating bike-sharing systems (FFBS), high-resolution and quantitative assessments about the economic benefits of FFBS for users are absent. This study proposes an innovative trip-level inference approach for quantifying the economic benefits of FFBS, leveraging massive FFBS transaction data, the emerging multimodal routing Application Programming Interface from online navigators and travel choice modeling. The proposed approach is able to analyze the economic benefit for every single bike-sharing trip and investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the economic benefits from FFBS. An empirical analysis in Shanghai is conducted using the proposed approach. The estimated saved travel time, cost, and economic benefit due to using FFBS per trip are estimated to be 9.95 min, 3.64 CNY, and 8.68 CNY-eq, respectively. The annual saved travel time, cost, and economic benefits from FFBS in Shanghai are estimated to be 17.665 billion min, 6.463 billion CNY, and 15.410 billion CNY-eq, respectively. The relationships between economic benefits from FFBS and built environment factors in different urban contexts are quantitatively examined using Multiple Linear Regression to explain the spatial heterogeneity in the economic benefits of FFBS. The outcomes provide a useful tool for evaluating the benefits of shared mobility systems, insights into the users’ economic benefit from using FFBS from per-trip, aggregated and spatial perspective, as well as its influencing factors.

Equity of public transport costs before and after a fare policy reform: An empirical evaluation using smartcard data,10.1016/j.tra.2020.12.010,144,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Smartcard-based public transit systems have been widely adopted across many cities around the world. These systems generate large volumes of transaction records from individual passenger trips and contain the requisite information that enable the mapping, measurement and monitoring of fare equity. In this paper, we propose and apply new measures to evaluate fare equity using smartcard data to map changes in fare equities following a fare policy reform across a major metropolitan region in Australia. Smartcard data is used to first reconstruct individual travel trajectories on which we compute our measures to explore two dimensions of equity: (1) ‘horizontal’ (for all passengers) versus ‘vertical’ (different types of passengers); and, (2) ‘global’ (across the entire transit network) versus ‘local’ (for a specific travel zone). Results reveal that in the first dimension the fare policy reform led to more equitable fares with the effect of diminishing spatial variations under the old policy for all types of transit passengers (adults, children, seniors and concession card holders); however, the impact of this fare policy reform reflected in the second dimension is subject to the number of zones travelled, residential location of passengers, the number of journeys made within the week and the applicable incentives. Finally, we draw on our empirical approach to report on a prototype dashboard through which public transit agencies have the capacity to map, measure and monitor how ridership translates to fare equities. More generally, we highlight the capacity of smartcard data, when embedded within our empirical framework, to better inform smarter policy around fare reforms in order to achieve greater equity across service populations.",0965-8564,Not found

The crowdsourced delivery mode has become a novel and popular practice in the last mile delivery industry. This mode brings a novel way for facilitating the efficiency of last mile delivery on the basis of the shared mobility. This paper studies an open vehicle routing problem (OVRP) for the shared mobility based last mile delivery mode, in which parcel delivery orders are disseminated within a circle to attract occasional vehicles (or couriers) to fulfill these orders. Different from the traditional OVRP, this study further considers the decision of the above mentioned circle’s radius, which should be balanced between attracting enough vehicles and reducing additional cost (reward) for covering vehicles’ empty trips to the pickup location. This paper proposes a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model for the problem. A column generation based solution method is implemented to solve the model. Some numerical experiments are also conducted to validate the efficiency of the solution method and draw out some managerial implications for the practitioners.

We find that purchase price and driving range play a crucial role in consumers’ decisions in both countries, whereas charging time is not statistically significant. Comparing the two countries, price sensitivity is relatively stronger in Italy, while the sensitivity for driving range and fuel economy is relatively stronger in Slovenia. Of the two latent variables we tested, we find that only environmental awareness has a statistically significant positive impact on the choice of electric cars and that it is stronger for Italians compared to Slovenians.

A multiple discrete continuous model of time use that accommodates non-additively separable utility functions along with time and monetary budget constraints,10.1016/j.tra.2020.11.009,144,2021-02-01,2021,2,"This paper proposes a multiple discrete continuous (MDC) choice modelling framework with the following features for analyzing individuals’ time use decisions: (a) accommodates non-additively separable (NAS) utility functions with respect to time allocation across different non-work activities, (b) considers both time and money constraints by integrating the two constraints into a single economic constraint, and (c) allows corner solutions for (i.e., non-participation in) discretionary, non-work activities. The proposed framework is applied to analyze weekly time use of employed individuals in Netherlands using a data set derived from the Time use and Consumption survey of the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel. The empirical results of the proposed model are compared to those from two simpler models – (a) a model that ignores the monetary budget constraint but employs the NAS utility function and (b) a model that considers both time and money budget constraints but uses a simpler, additively separable utility function. The results suggest that considering both time and money constraints, when combined with the NAS utility function, facilitates in capturing rich substitution patterns in time allocation to non-work activities, in addition to revealing demographic heterogeneity in satiation effects. Further, the proposed model offers a superior goodness of fit when compared to that from the simpler models that ignore either the monetary constraint or the NAS utility function. Finally, the model results provide important policy insights for reducing demographic inequities in time allocation among employed individuals.",0965-8564,Not found
Analysis of waiting time perception of bus passengers provided with mobile service,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.011,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Smartphones and relevant mobile service have greatly influenced people’s daily lives, and intense smartphone users can be commonly seen at transit stops/stations, playing with their smartphones while waiting for buses/trains. This research presents a holistic perspective for analyzing the effects of smartphone usage on transit passengers, which also considers the effects at a psychological level. Such effects may be manifested as the reduction of perceived waiting time at stops/stations against the negative emotionality induced by long waiting, such as boredom and tediousness, so as to result in improved travel experience. An on-site survey is designed and implemented over the bus system in Taipei, Taiwan, to collect the revealed responses of bus passengers in regard to waiting time perception and smartphone usage, particularly for travel-irrelevant mobile service. The survey data are modeled and analyzed in both numerical and verbal representation of perceived waiting time by using a multiple linear regression model and a cumulative proportional odds logistic model, respectively. A finite mixture model is further employed to investigate the potential heterogeneity of waiting time perception related to using smartphones for travel-irrelevant mobile service. The analysis results highlight that travel-irrelevant smartphone usage may lead to the reduction of perceived waiting, and the effect can be more significant for young passengers and those without receiving bus arrival information, especially when waiting time is prolonged. Such findings can contribute to the comprehensive consideration of passenger behavior in transit system planning and associated information/service provision strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
"Spatio-temporal analysis of on-demand transit: A case study of Belleville, Canada",10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.020,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"The rapid increase in the cyber-physical nature of transportation, availability of GPS data, mobile applications, and effective communication technologies have led to the emergence of On-Demand Transit (ODT) systems. In September 2018, the City of Belleville in Canada started an on-demand public transit pilot project, where the late-night fixed-route (RT 11) was substituted with the ODT providing a real-time ride-hailing service. We present an in-depth analysis of the spatio-temporal demand and supply, level of service, and origin and destination patterns of Belleville ODT users, based on the data collected from September 2018 till May 2019. The independent and combined effects of the demographic characteristics (population density, working-age, and median income) on the ODT trip production and attraction levels were studied using GIS and the K-means machine learning clustering algorithm. The results indicate that ODT trips demand is highest for 11:00 pm–11:45 pm during the weekdays and 8:00 pm–8:30 pm during the weekends. We expect this to be the result of users returning home from work or shopping. Results showed that 39% of the trips were found to have a waiting time of smaller than 15 min, while 28% of trips had a waiting time of 15–30 min. The dissemination areas with higher population density, lower median income, or higher working-age percentages tend to have higher ODT trip attraction levels, except for the dissemination areas that have highly attractive places like commercial areas. For the sustainable deployment of ODT services, we recommend (a) proactively relocating the empty ODT vehicles near the neighbourhoods with high level of activity, (b) dynamically updating the fleet size and location based on the anticipated changes in the spatio-temporal demand, and (c) using medium occupancy vehicles, like vans or minibuses to ensure high level of service.",0965-8564,Not found
Beyond the limits of memory? The reliability of retrospective data in travel research,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.010,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"In the last decades, an emerging research interest has developed for long-term, individual travel patterns. Retrospective methods as one approach to investigate long-term behaviour on the personal level are being applied more often in travel research. Although biases and errors in retrieval are well known in cognitive psychology and memory research, they are hardly discussed in travel research. This paper focuses on three research questions: (1) What insights into the quality of retrospective methods are provided by memory research, what are its strengths and weaknesses? (2) What can we derive from the theory for the empirical work and the design of surveys? (3) What results can we transfer to the application of retrospective methods in travel research? Firstly, this paper provides an overview of the most important recall traps, such as omission, incorrect numerical and biased retrieval. As memory research has shown, various techniques can support retrieval and response behaviour regarding past behaviour, for example, the choice of event type, memory characteristics and recall aids, such as temporal and thematic landmarks, help improve accuracy. Furthermore, the design of a retrospective survey plays an important role, for example by building up an internal and thematic framework in respondents. The use of retrospective methods in travel research is categorized in the application fields of life events, changes in travel patterns, social networks and travel distances, mobility socialization, travel attitudes and needs and mobility practices. Along these categories, this paper discusses the potential, risks and opportunities to improve the use of retrospective data in travel research.",0965-8564,Not found
Does highway project bundling policy affect bidding competition? Insights from a mixed ordinal logistic model,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.006,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Highway transportation project bundling can significantly reduce project delivery cost but could cause undesirable consequences such as reduced market competition. As such, bundling policy needs to be guided by a careful assessment of the potential impacts of bundling on bidding competition. This paper analyses the effect of project bundling policies on market competition using random-effects mixed ordinal logistic modelling, a probabilistic approach. The paper also investigates the variations of such effects across the different project types. The bundling policy factors that were found to be significantly impact bidding competition were the bundle size, bundling combination, and spatial proximity. The results suggest that bundled projects are generally associated with lower bidding competition compared to standalone projects, for all work categories except traffic projects. Further, where the bundled projects have proximal location, the bidding competition is generally higher. It was also determined that the different highway project types exhibit significant differences regarding the effect of bundling on competition: bundling policy (vis-à-vis standalone policy) generally leads to less intense competition for bridge, road, small-structures, miscellaneous, and utility projects, and more intense competition for traffic projects. In addition, it was found that there is a significant improvement on the model performance by including a random effects specification which diagnosed and addressed the unobserved heterogeneity that exists across the contract-letting years, for all the project types. The paper’s models can help highway agencies not only estimate the expected number of bidders for a given project under different bundling policies but also assess the effects of the bundling policy-related factors on bidding competition.",0965-8564,Not found
Time lag effects of COVID-19 policies on transportation systems: A comparative study of New York City and Seattle,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.019,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"The unprecedented challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic demand timely action. However, due to the complex nature of policy making, a lag may exist between the time a problem is recognized and the time a policy has its impact on a system. To understand this lag and to expedite decision making, this study proposes a change point detection framework using likelihood ratio, regression structure and a Bayesian change point detection method. The objective is to quantify the time lag effect reflected in transportation systems when authorities take action in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using travel patterns as an indicator of policy effectiveness, the length of policy lag and magnitude of policy impacts on the road system, mass transit, and micromobility are investigated through the case studies of New York City (NYC), and Seattle—two U.S. cities significantly affected by COVID-19. The quantitative findings show that the National declaration of emergency had no policy lag while stay-at-home and reopening policies had a lead effect on mobility. The magnitude of impact largely depended on the land use and sociodemographic characteristics of the area, as well as the type of transportation system.",0965-8564,Not found
Public support for tradable peak credit schemes,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.014,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Congestion charging is generally regarded as an effective tool to manage the ongoing growth in road use and to abate congestion. However, public support is typically very low and therefore very few charging schemes have been implemented. The concept of tradable peak credits (TPC), which is based on the cap-and-trade principle, has characteristics that are believed to lead to more public support. First, a TPC system is revenue-neutral since the money circulates within the user group. Also, the expected effectiveness, and thereby support, may be higher because, in a TPC system, the operator has more control over the inflow of cars due to the firm cap. Lastly, the allocation of free credits provides the opportunity to address equity issues. This paper aims to quantify the levels of support for TPC among the public and to explore what the influence of scheme design, personal characteristics and attitudes is on these levels of support. To that end, a stated choice experiment has been conducted in which respondents were asked whether they would vote for the implementation of different TPC schemes. The discrete choice model shows that 32%, and up to a small majority of 52%, would support different TPC schemes. Most people, however, like or dislike TPC regardless of the scheme design. It is attitudes, and to a limited extent also socio-demographics, that relate to someone’s level of support, rather than the scheme characteristics. Support is especially higher among people who find TPC fair and effective, who live outside the borders of the municipality and are lower educated. Although the results indicate that a small majority would support a TPC scheme, directions for future research are given to supplement this study.",0965-8564,Not found
Generalized noortman and van es’ empty trips model,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.005,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"This paper presents a generalized Noortman and Van Es’ empty trips model that considers commodity groups and vehicle types. The model allows the analyst to quantify the contribution of empty trips by the various types of commodities. The model was validated using data collected in Colombia as part of the national Freight Origin-Destination Survey. The results reveal that not all commodities generate empty trips in similar proportions, and commodities that require specialized equipment are the ones with the largest proportion of empty trips generated. Moreover, the results show that the proportions of empty trips generated by a given commodity varies across vehicle types. The key contribution of the model is that it produces more precise estimates of empty trips as it includes the impacts of the cargo type in the generation of empty trips. The proposed model could be used by planners to identify key commodities that could be paired together with equipment that could be repurposed to reduce empty trips in their regions.",0965-8564,Not found
Multi-class stochastic user equilibrium assignment model with ridesharing: Formulation and policy implications,10.1016/j.tra.2020.12.011,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"This paper proposes a logit-based multi-class ridesharing user equilibrium assignment framework that can incorporate different policy measures such as car restrictions, cordon tolling, and subsidization. The framework is formulated as a mixed complementarity problem (MCP). Numerical studies are conducted to illustrate model properties and compare the effects of these measures under different circumstances. The results show that the effectiveness of different policy measures can be greatly influenced by the performance of the transit mode compared with that of the driving mode and the users’ preference for traveling by car. The “cordon toll” policy can be better than the “car restriction” policy in terms of the improvement in social surplus when the performance of the competing transit system is poor. Subsidizing ridesharing (transit fares) using the toll income is the most effective when the performance of the competing transit system is poor (good). It is also found that the implementation of the cordon toll policy cannot effectively promote ridesharing when the performance of the transit system is good.",0965-8564,Not found
Cutting the loss: International benchmarking of a sustainable ferry business model,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.007,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"With rapid road infrastructure development in the past century, the role of water passenger transport has diminished drastically worldwide. A lot of ferry services in coastal cities have become financially unviable. However, water transport has huge potentials in promoting transport sustainability and resilience. This paper proposes a holistic framework that examines five core elements in a ferry business model, including (i) population demand, (ii) connectivity to public transit and activity nodes, (iii) individual preferences, (iv) management and operational strategies and (v) pier infrastructure. An international benchmarking framework of ferry operation and pier management across several cities with large-scale ferry development (Brisbane, Hong Kong, London, New York, San Francisco and Venice) is proposed and tested in Hong Kong. There are several general lessons. First, providing denser and more diversified opportunities (employment, commercial, recreation and open space) near the piers with good connectivity is essential. Direct access to these activities by water transport and well-developed intermodal transfer are conducive to ferry patronage. Second, improving the travel experience of passengers, including pre-boarding and on-board experience, is fundamental. Overall, integrating ferry services, pier infrastructure and promenade development in a policy package is critical to the long-term viability of ferry transport, although several critical challenges need to be addressed.",0965-8564,Not found
"Exploring the relationship between bike-sharing and public transport in Poznań, Poland",10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.003,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"It is widely believed that bike-sharing has the potential to encourage sustainable travel by combining the flexibility of cycling with the reliability of public transport. However, there is actually little empirical evidence concerning the scale of that effect. While many models of bike-sharing travel patterns include station locations, only a few have accounted for heterogeneity in service levels. This paper aims to fill this gap by examining the case of the bike-sharing system in the city of Poznań (536,000 inhabitants). We hypothesise that a higher number of bike-sharing trips could be found in places with a higher frequency of public transport. A model based on trips data mined through a web application programming interface (over 19,240,000 GPS recorded bicycle positions), and open public transport frequency data from the general transit feed specification is used. Regression results show that while including control variables and spatial effects, the frequency of public transport was significantly associated with the number of bike-sharing trips. A positive effect existed for short and medium trips, whereas no relationship was found for long trips. Findings support the view that public transport frequency is a relevant factor for bike-sharing which should be taken into account in planning.",0965-8564,Not found
"Transport accessibility, residential satisfaction, and moving intention in a context of limited travel mode choice",10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.012,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"This paper examines the effects of transport accessibility on residential satisfaction and moving intention when travel mode choice is limited. It uses the case of Yangon City in Myanmar, where bus is the dominant transport mode, automobile dependence is low, and the use of two-wheel vehicle is restricted in some areas of the city. These characteristics altogether indicate that the potential bias arising from the unobserved differences in people’s travel mode preferences can be minimized. Based on a sample of about 5,200 residents living close to bus stops, structural equation modeling is used to test the effects of objective and subjective measures of bus stop accessibility on residential satisfaction and moving intention. The results show that high perceived bus stop accessibility—not short distance between the residence and the nearest bus stop—is associated with high residential satisfaction, and neither measures of bus stop accessibility is associated with moving intention. These findings indicate that the perception of bus stop accessibility matters for residential satisfaction rather than the actual distance between the residence and the nearest bus stop, and the low satisfaction with bus stop accessibility is not expected to induce households to consider moving to a new residence or location. The actual distance between the residence and the nearest bus stop has the strongest influence on perceived bus stop accessibility, followed by the satisfaction with neighborhood’s safety and security, holding household characteristics constant. From a policy perspective, the findings underscore the relevance of including subjective measures of accessibility in designing or improving the accessibility of transport systems. To aid planning, there is a need to explore the objective factors that underlie people’s satisfaction with transport accessibility. Moreover, an integrated housing and transport policy could bring significant gains to residents, as desirable neighborhood features are associated with not only high perceived bus stop accessibility but also high residential satisfaction and low moving intention.",0965-8564,Not found
New method for predicting long-term travel time of commercial vehicles to improve policy-making processes,10.1016/j.tra.2020.12.003,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Long-term travel time prediction, ahead of making a trip, is vital from the planning perspective of delivery freight, timetable design, vehicle/crew scheduling and further activities. The better the prediction is, the higher the reliability of service that can be offered. This study presents a discrete and continuous combined analysis for attaining improved long-term travel time prediction (LTTP) of commercial vehicles. One main problem of LTTP is that the speed factors are unknown ahead of trips. In light of this, the nonnegative tensor factorization and completion with neural weighted initialization is proposed to extract the potential speed patterns among multiple discrete factors and to complete the sparse tensors. The Gaussian mixture regression is adopted for handling the continuous factors. The proposed methodology with a combined discrete and continuous analysis is able to effectively integrate multiple factors into the computation, including vehicle type, road type, days, time period, weather conditions, driver differences and travel distance. The methodology is able to reduce the long-term travel time prediction error between 14% and 43% compared with the traditional average speed method and other baseline methods, which suggests its effectiveness. It can strategically assist policy-making processes of stakeholders on investment, insurance, planning and management, and can help tactically in predicting long-term travel time ahead of the scheduled trips to improve the reliability of the schedules. Furthermore, operationally, it can also be used to enrich current navigation information systems by separately predicting the commercial vehicles’ travel time based on multiple factors.",0965-8564,Not found
Freight trips generated at retail malls in dense urban areas,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.015,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"The number of studies examining Freight Trip Generation (FTG) has increased over the years. However, FTG modeling studies in different urban settings have presented wide-ranging results in terms of the relationship between establishment characteristics, freight deliveries, and resultant freight vehicle trips produced and attracted. This study aims to evaluate freight trips generated around retail developments or commercial districts in dense metropolitan areas, commonplace in both emerging and developed cities, which are known to attract high footfall and represent key freight attracting nodes. Establishment-level data was collected from six multi-storey retail malls in the city-state of Singapore and used to develop an aggregated model predicting FTG for retail malls or shopping centres. Using statistical regression, we model the relationship between establishment-specific attributes and deliveries per day, and then evaluate various models that can best predict freight vehicle trips per day to retail malls. This aggregated approach converts the establishment-level freight trip attraction to a building-level freight trip generation by considering trip chaining or the possibility of a carrier delivering to multiple establishments within the building during the same visit or trip. The selected model’s statistical performance is validated with observed freight vehicle arrivals at 16 retail malls. A comparison of the delivery frequency per commercial establishment across different cities is also offered. FTG for these developments is found to be sensitive to the establishment type, employment size, and whether or not the establishments present are branch outlets belonging to a larger retail chain. Contributions from this work can be applied in the evaluation of urban freight logistics initiatives targeted at these locations, and to assess the nontrivial impact that retail developments in cities have on local traffic conditions.",0965-8564,Not found

However, the vast majority of these studies have been limited to Western (North-American and European) contexts and draw evidence from the general population. Much less studies of bicycling behaviour have been carried out in East- Asian contexts and focus on lower social-economic population. Relying a survey data from Xi’an, China, this study investigates the personal, spatial, social and psychological factors associated with bicycling for transportation in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. In contrast to the results of many previous studies, this study finds that social norms have the greatest effect on bicycling behaviour, while attitudes toward bicycling do not affect bicycling. Among the neighbourhood environment characteristics, this study finds neighbourhood aesthetics, bicycle infrastructure, and access to subway stations are important factors in promoting utilitarian bicycling in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in China. Finally, an interesting finding of our study is that the spatial characteristics that improve attitudes toward bicycling (such as access to amenities and street connectivity) do not lead to more bicycling, due to their positive effect of walking. Overall, these findings offer important policy implications regarding designing effective interventions to promote bicycling in disadvantaged neighbourhoods and Chinese cities, and the special policy consideration of stimulating walking and bicycling jointly.",0965-8564,Not found

Our analysis shows that toll road usage affects both residential location preferences and travel behaviour. This influence varies across income groups and used travel mode and also depends on trip characteristics. Overall, the respondents in our survey prefer toll road options, as also shown by positive attitudes towards the toll road, except for low-income respondents and bus users. Furthermore, we found a significant association between residential location preference and route and mode choices for frequent users of the toll road, low-income respondents and residents who live close to the toll road. It means that self-selection exists between residential location choice and mode-route choice, and it is linked to the distance to the toll gate and frequency of using the toll road.

Social norms as a cost-effective measure of managing transport demand: Evidence from an experiment on the London underground,10.1016/j.tra.2020.12.006,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Demand for public transport in cities has been and is projected to increase, putting existing transport networks under increasing strain. Nudging passengers to behave in certain ways through the creation of a salient social norm has the potential to be a cost-effective mechanism to manage transport demand. Transport for London (TfL) implemented in the second half of 2017 an experiment on one of its busiest metro train platforms. The platform surface was painted to highlight the exact location of the train doors once it comes to a full stop and to direct passengers to wait in parts of the platform that would not obstruct passengers from alighting from the train and leaving the platform. Drawing on millions of individual train waiting times, we estimate the effect of this intervention to change passenger behaviour on the platform on train waiting and delay times. We use different sets of assumptions about what the counterfactual change in waiting and delay times would have been in the absence of the intervention. The intervention has reduced train waiting times by up to 6.6%. This reduction came about mainly through reducing delay times of trains once they are delayed. The reductions tend to occur during peak traffic hours. The implied cost-savings amount to a return of £6 per £1 investment.",0965-8564,Not found
Why do Gender Differences in Daily Mobility Behaviours persist among workers?,10.1016/j.tra.2020.12.016,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Gender is commonly identified as a key explanatory factor for travel behaviour. Since women’s role in societal structure has changed in the past few decades, the question arises as to whether the “gender” factor still plays a decisive role in differences in mobility within the working population. The aim of this paper is to extend the research on gendered differences in mobility by providing an in-depth analysis of how the main determinants of daily mobility affect male and female workers differently. Unlike previous research, our econometric models included terms that express the interactions between the explanatory variables (socioeconomic variables and transport mode access) and a dichotomous gender variable, to accurately identify the marginal impact of gender on mobility indicators. Based on the Rhône-Alpes regional household travel survey (2012–2015), which includes France’s second largest urban area, the results show that even if gender differences in employment status and access to the private car are eliminated, differences in travel patterns between men and women would still be observed because the two genders do not have identical factor sensitivities. From a policy perspective, these results suggest that authorities have to adopt a gender perspective to ensure that in the future urban mobility policies provide gender equity in the context of the sustainable development of transport networks.",0965-8564,Not found
Revisiting the impacts of virtual mobility on travel behavior: An exploration of daily travel time expenditures,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.002,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"There has been a growing interest in the association between online activities and daily activity-travel patterns.

This study contributes to the literature by exploring the relationships between Information and Communication Technology (ICT) use (focusing on telework and online shopping) and time spent traveling using different transportation modes. Using Tobit regression models, we investigate the impacts of ICT use on three travel alternatives: (1) automobile, (2) public transit, and (3) active travel. The results show that the effects of ICT use vary across these three travel modes. For example, all else being equal, respondents with higher durations of telework tend to spend less time on auto and transit. Respondents with higher durations of online shopping spend more time walking and bicycling. This study also explores whether the effects of ICT use on travel durations vary across groups with different socio-demographics and residential location characteristics. For instance, the study finds the greater the level of land-use mixture, the stronger the association between online shopping and time spent bicycling and walking. The research findings can inform planners and decision-makers on the relationships between ICT use and overall travel behavior in order to assess travel demand under different levels of ICT use.",0965-8564,Not found
Mobility as a service and private car use: Evidence from the Sydney MaaS trial,10.1016/j.tra.2020.12.015,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Australia’s first Mobility as a Service (MaaS) trial commenced in April 2019 in Sydney, running for two years. The objective of the trial is at least twofold – to assess interest in various MaaS subscription plans through bundling public transport, rideshare, car share and car rental with varying financial discounts and monthly subscription fees, in contrast to pay as you go (PAYG); and to assess the extent to which the use of the private car might change following a subscription to a monthly mobility bundle. This paper assesses the second objective by investigating the potential for changes in monthly car use in the presence of a MaaS program. There is no previous research that we are aware of that has tested the relationship between MaaS bundle uptake and private car use. The paper develops a joint discrete-continuous model system to explain the choice between monthly bundles and PAYG, and subsequently, the total monthly car kilometres. Controlling for monthly differences due to other influences such as seasonal travel activity, the findings suggest that the offered bundles do have an encouraging impact on private car use. Within the limits of what was tested under the Sydney MaaS trial, indicative evidence suggests that MaaS has the potential to change travel behaviour in a way aligned with sustainability objectives, although this evidence should not be taken as suggesting that MaaS is a commercially viable mobility strategy.",0965-8564,Not found
Effects of bicycle passing distance law on drivers’ behavior,10.1016/j.tra.2020.12.017,145,2021-03-01,2021,3,"This paper identifies the effect of passing distance laws on drivers’ perceptions and behaviors when passing bicycles. Using an instrumented bicycle, the study measured bicycle passing in a 25-h naturalistic field experiment using video recording and an ultrasonic distance-measuring device. In order to evaluate the effect of passing distance laws, the study examined jurisdictions with a three-foot passing law, a five-foot passing law, and no passing law. The experiment required a bicyclist to ride the instrumented bicycle in two-lane and three-lane roads to capture the distance between the bicycle and the overtaking motor vehicle. An Ordered Probit model was adopted to describe the relationship between a discrete dependent variable (i.e., passing distance) and independent variables. The results demonstrated that drivers’ overtaking distances were significantly greater in locations with the five-foot passing law than in other areas. The study also found that roads with paved shoulders, wider travel lanes, and a greater number of lanes contributed to greater passing distances. In contrast, we found that the passing distance was shorter on roads with shared lane markings (i.e., sharrows) or a higher share of heat vehicles. Moreover, a survey was conducted in locations with different passing laws and ordinances to determine drivers’ awareness and the effect of such policies on drivers’ behavior. The study illustrates that almost 70% of drivers in areas with a passing law were unaware of any existing laws requiring drivers to maintain a distance from bicyclists. These results can be useful to transportation engineers, policymakers, and legislators who intend to provide efficient designs for road infrastructure to better accommodate bicycles.",0965-8564,Not found

Thus, via an online survey and econometric modeling, we show that respondents appreciate the usefulness of punctuality indicators for planning their long-distance rail trips. The usefulness is reinforced by the fact that respondents employ several modes for regular trips and frequent train users. Moreover, they have already experienced missed appointments or connections. The risk attitude and prudence of respondents also play an important role but not totally in the expected direction.

The case of new energy vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.018,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"New energy vehicles (NEVs) are welcomed by both policymakers and consumers because of their energy saving and low carbon properties. However, due to their high production cost and limited cruising range, the development of the NEV industry relies heavily on governments’ cash subsidy (CS) programs. At the same time, policymakers in several countries, including the United States (California) and China, have introduced carbon regulation (CR) to re-energize the NEV market. CS and CR have different impacts on the consumer and production sides. To this end, we propose a hybrid model combining the advantages of both. Through this model, the impacts of different interventions on product demands, profits, carbon emissions and technology R&D are derived: (1) CS always increases the demand for NEVs, while CR promotes NEVs only when NEVs are emission saving; providing CS increases the profits of the supply chain members, but supply chain profits under CR show uncertain trends; (2) CS reduces total emissions only if the unit carbon emission of NEVs is small enough, and the effect of NEVs’ carbon quota on total emissions under CR shows a similar trend, whereas the impact of carbon price on total emissions under CR depends on specific thresholds. Further results show that when a customer values NEVs highly, the proposed hybrid model produces the lowest total emission; (3) Optimal technology R&D for the cruising range of NEVs increases under CS if the subsidy provided is based on the actual cruising range; otherwise, CR performs better. The hybrid model shows potential in outperforming the other two policies in terms of the optimal technology R&D; (4) Supply chain integration decreases the optimal technology R&D in the case of CR, whereas in the case of CS, technology R&D does not vary with integration or decentralization of the supply chain.",0965-8564,Not found
"Portraying ride-hailing mobility using multi-day trip order data: A case study of Beijing, China",10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.017,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"As a newly-emerging travel mode in the era of mobile internet, ride-hailing that connects passengers with private-car drivers via an online platform has been very popular all over the world. Although it attracts much attention in both practice and theory, the understanding of ride-hailing is still very limited largely because of the lack of related data. For the first time, this paper introduces ride-hailing drivers’ multi-day trip order data and portrays ride-hailing mobility in Beijing, China, from the regional and driver’s perspectives. The analyses from the regional perspective help understand the spatiotemporal flowing of the ride-hailing demand, and those from the driver’s perspective characterize the ride-hailing drivers’ preferences in providing ride-hailing services. A series of findings are obtained, such as the observation of the spatiotemporal rhythm of a city in using ride-hailing services and two categories of ride-hailing drivers in terms of the correlation between the activity space and working time. Those findings contribute to the understanding of ride-hailing activities, the prediction of ride-hailing demand, the modeling of ride-hailing drivers’ preferences, and the management of ride-hailing services.",0965-8564,Not found
On-street parking management and pricing policies: An evaluation from a system enhancement perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.009,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Car parking policies often aim to relieve or better distribute parking demand in central urban areas. Evaluating their effectiveness requires the investigation of traveller behaviour and responses to parking attributes such as availability, cost, walking distance, and time restriction. Parking policies, which are usually cost-intensive to implement, are crucial in solving parking problems and transportation system problems in general. To investigate parking policy properly, developing agent-based parking systems is beneficial. Motivated by a recent parking management system designed for Kingsford, Sydney, this paper introduces an agent-based simulation model to analyse the effects of different parking policies in a realistic dynamic framework. Furthermore, a novel behavioural pricing formulation is integrated into the simulation model, which dynamically seeks to maximise the total utility of all agents in the system with consideration of their travel behaviours. The model is implemented for the Kingsford town centre, to investigate the effects of different parking policies and demand scenarios on parking utilisation and system performance.",0965-8564,Not found
"MPG, fuel costs, or savings? Exploring the role of information framing in consumer valuation of fuel economy using a choice experiment",10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.004,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Despite the large body of literature, there is still considerable debate and uncertainty about how consumers value fuel economy. This study explores how the presentation of fuel economy information can influence valuation using a stated choice experiment with comparative experimental conditions. We randomly assigned a nationally representative sample of 1,612 intended vehicle purchasers in the United States to one of six conditions, which varied in their presentation of fuel economy information as follows: miles per gallon, annual fuel costs, five-year fuel cost, lifetime fuel cost, amount of money saved/spent over five years compared to the average vehicle per class, and the full government-mandated fuel economy label (in the US). We find that consumer valuation of fuel economy is causally impacted by the information presented. In particular, we observe significantly higher willingness-to-pay values for participants in the condition with the full fuel economy label, relative to conditions only presented with the annual fuel cost, five-year fuel cost, and spend/save comparison. Valuation also varied with the demographic characteristics of participants: fuel economy was more highly valued among older participants and those that anticipated a relatively lower purchase price for their next vehicle. This study suggests that the observed inconsistencies in consumer valuation of fuel economy in the literature may stem in part from differences in the framing of fuel economy information across studies – at least for stated preference studies.",0965-8564,Not found
"Support for market-based and command-and-control congestion relief policies in Latin American cities: Effects of mobility, environmental health, and city-level factors",10.1016/j.tra.2020.12.004,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Public support for the implementation of congestion relief policies is critical for the policies’ technical and political success. To identify the personal, social, and city-level factors associated with higher acceptance towards such policies, this study uses a 2016 survey of 8178 residents from 11 cities across 10 Latin American countries collected by the Development Bank of Latin America (Corporación Andina de Fomento or CAF). We examined support for two demand-side approaches to managing the traffic congestion externality: congestion pricing – a market-based approach, and driving restrictions or bans – a command-and-control approach. Logit regression models show that personal mobility such as owning or using a private vehicle during a respondent’s main commute trip are associated with decreased support, while higher congestion delay in one’s commute and having a young child recently diagnosed with respiratory problems increases support for either congestion relief policy. In addition, residents of cities with higher levels of median annual particulate matter and with prior experience with traffic bans expressed higher support for either policy. Residents of cities with higher income inequality supported only driving restrictions; while those of cities with higher GDP per capita had lower support only for congestion pricing. To improve the public acceptance of congestion relief policies in Latin America, policy makers could: (1) explicitly seek to mitigate the costs it brings on individuals by investing in substitutes like public transportation; (2) promote the personal and social environmental and health benefits; (3) consider beginning with temporary, pilot programs; and in the case of driving restrictions, (4) take into account city-specific conditions related to income inequality that may influence public support for the policies.",0965-8564,Not found
An environmental and techno-economic analysis of transporting LNG via Arctic route,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.005,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The Northern Sea Route (NSR) might be a promising route for LNG transportation from the LNG plants in Russia’s Yamal Peninsula to Northeast Asia countries with significant savings in sailing distance and time compared to traditional Suez Canal Route (SCR). However, surging transportation activities along NSR might harm the environment with the greenhouse gas (GHG) and atmospheric pollutant emissions. Little research has been done to investigate the environmental and techno-economic potential of transporting LNG via NSR. Furthermore, this paper analyses the relevance of an Arc4 ice-class vessel, not currently used for this route. This paper targets to address the question that how much GHGs and atmospheric pollutants does a carrier emit and how is the feasibility of different fuel types for the summer and winter transportation considering environmental impacts. An environmental and techno-economic model quantifying the emissions and total costs have been developed and 3 scenarios of using different fuel types (HFO, MDO, LNG) are proposed to investigate the environmental and economic performances in summer and winter respectively. Our results reveal that the unit cost of transporting LNG via NSR is around 90 U.S. $ cents/GJ in summer and 120 $ cents/GJ in winter considering environmental cost. The findings also show that in the short run when regardless of environmental cost, HFO is still the preferable option for ships by its competitive cost. While when considering the environmental cost, LNG has better economic and environmental performance than other fuel types. So, for the long run, LNG might be encouraged to be the main fuel used in Arctic.",0965-8564,Not found
Where are public bikes? The decline of dockless bike-sharing supply in Singapore and its resulting impact on ridership activities,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.016,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Active mobility modes have become a significant alternative mode of transport within all major urban cities. This could be partly attributed to the rise and fall of dockless bike-sharing services in the last three years which significantly changed the transport ecosystem in these cities. However, the various complex relationships between the supply of bike-sharing services, the generated demand as well as the cycling dynamics and behavior of subscribers is not well understood. In this article, we examine how the changes in bike supply impacted the cycling activities of a dockless bike-sharing system in Singapore. We employed a clustering algorithm and modelled the network community detection tool into a three-month cycling GPS dataset and compared the spatiotemporal pattern and network structures of biking journeys for two major time periods (1) January 2019 and (2) March 2019 between which a significant number of bike-sharing companies exited the industry. This resulted in a drastic drop in the number of available shared bikes for the latter period. Our results show that prior to the decline of the bike supply, we identified three types of bike journeys that shared similar temporal patterns, indicating different riders, namely casual, moderate, or enthusiastic users. Over 90 percentage of enthusiastic riders disappeared after the supply of public bikes decreased. Our network analysis further showed that nine out of ten observed communities either contracted or collapsed after the supply downsize. We therefore hope that urban and transportation planners and scientists would be able to use these findings to further understand the dynamics of supply demand of bike-sharing systems and help improve planning considerations in the future.",0965-8564,Not found
Does ridesourcing impact driving decisions: A survey weighted regression analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.006,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The initial public offerings (IPOs) of Uber and Lyft in 2019 marked a milestone for the decade-old ridesourcing. As we start to embrace ridesourcing in our daily life, we also rearrange our daily travel amongst different modes of transportation. As the fundamental decisions in travel behavior, car ownership and car travel should be re-examined in the advent of shared mobility. In this paper, we applied a vehicle choice model that factors in ridesourcing frequency to understand the decisions about (1) how many cars an individual would declare as the primary driver of, and (2) the annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) for all cars he or she drive. We used a subsample of the latest 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data that focus on the Capital region (Washington, D.C. – Maryland – Virginia) as our study area. We applied a weighted regression analysis following the NHTS survey design and derived population-representative results on both decisions. In addition, we calculated the driving cost for each household vehicle based on the latest fuel economy data and incorporated driving cost into the car travel model. The results suggest that ridesourcing is associated with a smaller chance of an individual being the primary driver of a car. However, the elasticity indicates that ridesourcing usage has a small impact on the number of primarily driven cars. Furthermore, ridesourcing has no significant impact on the annual VMT, either. Driving cost, on the other hand, still plays the key role in determining driving distances.",0965-8564,Not found
Full title: Well-being and mobility: A new perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.003,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The connections between transportation and subjective well-being have received increasing attention in the transportation literature. Yet there are few studies on the relationship between objective well-being and transportation. Objective well-being is the achievement of a persons’ potential in knowledge, health, friendship, and other life domains, through the development of their embodied capacities to know, create and be sociable. The value of these achievements is objective, in the sense that it is not derived from a person’s attitudes or mental state. Thus, objective well-being adds an important dimension to the study of well-being and transportation, as it can explain why active, embodied mobility modes—such as walking and cycling—offer more opportunities for human capacity development, compared to sedentary modes such as driving and riding in a driverless car. Embodied mobility modes activate a well-rounded combination of human capacities thus contributing to better understanding of one’s environment, creative flow and sociability, in turn enhancing one’s overall well-being. This may add important information for transportation planners and urban designers in design and evaluation of mobility environments.",0965-8564,Not found

The results indicated that around two-thirds of the participants voted against the LECZ scheme, and that latent psychological factors had a stronger impact on voting against the LECZ than observed variables. The results also revealed that people would be more likely to adopt and less likely to oppose the LECZ if the price, maintenance, and repair of HEVs were affordable. Regarding public attitudes towards the proposed system, distrust in government concerning the use of LECZ-derived revenues was noticeably related to the LECZ rejection. In the light of the findings, some policy and planning implications are recommended.",0965-8564,Not found
Examining the influence of attitudinal factors on the use of ride-hailing services in Toronto,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.002,146,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The continued growth of ride-hailing usage creates the need for policymakers to understand the factors that affect the adoption and utilization of ride-hailing services. Attitudinal and perceptual factors are of particular importance, both because ride-hailing services are still evolving, and a relatively small number of studies have examined the role of these factors. This paper utilizes data from a web-based survey to understand the role that latent attitudinal factors play in adopting and using ride-hailing services in Toronto. Specifically, two binary logistic regression models are used to understand the factors that influence the adoption of exclusive and shared ride-hailing services. Besides, a zero-inflated ordered probit (ZIOP) model is estimated to investigate the factors that affect the frequency with which a person uses ride-hailing. The empirical investigation reveals that the perception of ride-hailing services tends to differ between individuals with ride-hailing experience and those without, which is expected given the relative novelty of ride-hailing. The logistic regression models reveal that, although common attributes affect the likelihood that a person has adopted a ride-hailing service, the influence of these factors varies based on the specific type of service. This underscores the value of distinguishing between exclusive and shared ride-hailing services. The ZIOP model shows that attitudinal factors regarding qualitative trip characteristics, the inclination towards using ride-hailing services in certain situations, and the consideration of parking requirements affect the frequency with which a person uses ride-hailing. Also, transit pass ownership was found to influence the frequency with which a person uses ride-hailing positively. The results of this study aim to provide insights into the adoption and utilization of ride-hailing, which can help inform policies that aim to encourage the use of shared ride-hailing as an alternative to exclusive ride-hailing services.",0965-8564,Not found

Restricting vehicle dwell time is widely used to manage commercial vehicle parking behavior. However, there is insufficient data to help assess the effectiveness of these restrictions. This makes it difficult for policymakers to account for the complexity of commercial vehicle parking behavior. The current study aims to identify factors correlated with dwell time for commercial vehicles. This is accomplished by using generalized linear models with data collected from five buildings that are known to include commercial vehicle activities in the downtown area of Seattle, Washington, USA. Our models showed that dwell times for buildings with concierge services tended to be shorter. Deliveries of documents also tended to have shorter dwell times than oversized supplies deliveries. Passenger vehicle deliveries had shorter dwell times than deliveries made with vehicles with roll-up doors or swing doors (e.g., vans and trucks). When there were deliveries made to multiple locations within a building, the dwell times were significantly longer than dwell times made to one location in a building. The findings from the presented models demonstrate the potential for improving future parking policies for commercial vehicles by considering data collected from different building types, delivered goods, and vehicle types.",0965-8564,Not found
Economic benefits of road widening: Discrepancy between outturn and forecast,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.023,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Cost-benefit analysis of road investments involves models that generate travel time savings as the main economic benefit. Monitoring of traffic flows after the widening of the section of the M25 London orbital motorway between Junctions 23 and 27 found substantial increases in traffic volumes, of up to 23% two to three years after opening, but no increase in speed of travel beyond the first year. Comparison was made with the forecast traffic flows, made using a variable demand model based on SATURN software. The model projected increased traffic volumes and speeds as a consequence of road widening, but underestimated traffic volumes and overestimated traffic speeds compared to outturn. The forecast of faster traffic speeds was the input to the economic model used to compare investment benefits with costs, yielding a benefit-cost ratio of 2.9, which justified the investment. However, the absence of observed increase in traffic speed raises questions about the applicability of a long-established transport model and of travel time savings as the main economic benefit of road investment, as well as about the value of investment to increase the capacity of strategic roads where these are used extensively for local trips.",0965-8564,Not found
Could there be spillover effects between recreational and utilitarian cycling? A multivariate model,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.017,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The current study aims to investigate the impact of socioeconomic and bike infrastructure-related factors on the choice to cycle for different purposes (commuting, errands and leisure/sport) and explores the interplay between these three choices. We developed and estimated a multivariate ordered probit model that accounts for correlation effects among dependent variables, i.e. the three different frequencies of cycling for different purposes, and simultaneously controls for the impact of endogenous and exogenous variables. The data used in this study are drawn from a survey conducted by the University of Cagliari in two mid-size urban areas in Sardinia (Italy). We analysed a sample of 1,105 individuals with prerequisites useful for the study at hand. Model results show that different socio-demographic variables such as gender, age, level of education, household composition and vehicle ownership influence our dependent variables. The results are consistent with previous research, with males and younger individuals more likely to cycle, while people with children show a lower propensity to use the bike for both transportation and recreational purposes. Further, we show that, in the specific context of the analysis, unobserved effects between the three dependent variables exist and a higher frequency of cycling for leisure leads to a higher frequency of cycling for utilitarian purposes, suggesting the presence of a behavioral spillover effect. Finally, a policy simulation analysis is carried out to estimate the impact of the endogenous variable cycling for leisure on the probability of choosing to cycle for utilitarian purposes. In particular, we find that the adoption of an independent model that ignores the presence of unobserved effects among dependent variables leads to a small overprediction of the number of people cycling for utilitarian purposes.",0965-8564,Not found

It was shown that descriptive social norms played an important role in shaping user’s attitudes toward orderly parking directly and indirectly via personal norms, and thus influence the behavioral intention of orderly parking. Cultural tightness-looseness further moderated the effect of descriptive social norms. At the individual level, antecedents of personal norms (moral awareness, awareness of consequences, and ascription of responsibility) were investigated based on Norm Activation Model.

Evaluating the feasibility of combined use of the Northern Sea Route and the Suez Canal Route considering ice parameters,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.024,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Even though the Arctic ice is melting and Polar routes are being extensively studied, the amount of cargo shipped through the Northern Sea Route (NSR) remains low. Employing current data on the NSR operation provided by China Ocean Shipping Company, this paper investigates annual profitability of the NSR-SCR combined use, when a vessel sails through the NSR in summer and the SCR in winter. A Handysize general cargo ship is used as a model vessel since it allows reaching nearly maximum load rate and can sail through shallow areas of the NSR. This article proposes including ice thickness and ice conditions in the traditional cost comparison. The first parameter directly affects sailing speed, and hence other cost variables, while the second one is included in the official NSR navigation rules and connected with icebreaker escort fee. This paper also contributes to the existing literature by considering total shipping cost as a function of a vessel's ice class with corresponding building premiums and fuel consumption increments. The proposed approach is easily replicable, so shipping companies might use it to rethink their positions on shipping through the NSR. The overall conservative comparison reveals that the NSR-SCR combined shipping scheme can only be more competitive than sailing through the SCR if a shipping company provides a sufficient load rate on the NSR leg and uses a ship of a reliable ice class to navigate throughout the summer navigation. The NSR-SCR combined shipping scheme becomes attractive if the NSR leg is short, and the crude oil price is high.",0965-8564,Not found
Estimating the uncertainty of traffic forecasts from their historical accuracy,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.015,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Traffic forecasters may find value in expressing the uncertainty of their forecasts as a range of expected outcomes. Traditional methods for estimating such uncertainty windows rely on assumptions about reasonable ranges of travel demand forecasting model inputs and parameters. Rather than relying on assumptions, we demonstrate how to use empirical measures of past forecast accuracy to estimate the uncertainty in future forecasts. We develop an econometric framework based on quantile regression to estimate an expected (median) traffic volume as a function of the forecast, and a range within which we expect 90% of traffic volumes to fall. Using data on observed versus forecast traffic for 3912 observations from 1291 road projects, we apply this framework to estimate a model of overall uncertainty and a full model that considers the effect of project attributes. Our results show that the median post-opening traffic is 6% lower than forecast. The expected range of outcomes varies significantly with the forecast volume, the forecast method, the project type, the functional class, the time span and the unemployment rate at the time forecast is made. For example, consider a 5-year forecast for an existing arterial roadway made in 2019 when the state unemployment rate was 4% using a travel model. If a travel model predicted 30,000 Average Daily Traffic (ADT) on this road, our results suggest that 90% of future traffic volumes would fall between 19,000 and 36,000 ADT. A forecaster can apply the resulting equations to calculate an uncertainty window for their project, or they can estimate new quantile regression equations from locally collected forecast accuracy data. Aided by decision intervals, such uncertainty windows can help planners determine whether a forecast deviation would change a project decision.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of the MeToo scandal on women's perceptions of security,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.018,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"This study assesses whether the negative exogenous informational shock of the MeToo scandal has affected women’s perception of security. The MeToo movement was first reported in the media worldwide in October 2017, and has received enormous press coverage since then. The exogenous and unanticipated nature of the scandal provides a natural experiment that we can use to quantify how wider external information affects ‘ordinary’ women’s perceptions of security and their willingness to report feelings of dissatisfaction with security levels. To do so, we use a case study of women’s’ perception of security in 12 metro systems in Europe, for which we have large-scale unique customer satisfaction data over the years 2014 to 2018. We use interview dates to determine perceptions pre and post scandal, and we take the MeToo scandal as a ‘treatment’ affecting women in the sense that they were the primary target of the informational shock. Using pre and post treatment data, for our defined treated (women) and control (men) units, we apply a difference-in-differences estimator to identify the impact of the scandal on perceptions of security. Our results show a 2.5% increase in the probability of women being dissatisfied with security in stations and in metro carriages post-scandal. These results support the conclusion that revealed preferences are only revealed up to a certain extent. A change in the context (e.g., an informational shock), can alter perceptions and in turn, can encourage individuals to disclose lower (or higher) satisfaction levels as perceptions of the norm change.",0965-8564,Not found
Navigability assessment of large-scale redesigns in nine public transport networks: Open timetable data approach,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.015,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Redesigns of public transport networks are complex undertakings requiring a careful balancing of several conflicting perspectives (e.g., user requirements vs system performance) and aims (e.g., increasing spatial coverage, increasing frequency). Current assessment tools omit an explicit focus on navigability, often identified as a key aspect of the user perspective. For understanding the multidimensional perspective of navigability, this research introduces an assessment framework with both system and journey-level measures. The system-level measures provide an overview of redesigns based on static network representations. The journey-level measures are based on journey trajectories generated with a customized routing algorithm, assessing the distributive effects of the redesign. The framework is applied to public transport networks from nine cities with recently implemented redesigns, namely Amsterdam, Auckland, Austin, Baltimore, Columbus, Helsinki, Houston, Indianapolis, and Wellington. Results indicate that the redesigns have improved navigability both from a system-level and user perspective in general. However, in some cases, improvements in navigability come at the cost of increased travel time and number of transfers. Furthermore, the results suggest that the redesigns have differing emphasis within the regions, for different times of day, and for different aspects of network structure. The results are discussed both from the perspective of the case findings and for drawing more general planning and policy recommendations. Finally, this research provides a basis for further transdisciplinary approaches, encouraging connections between transport modeling and complex networks approaches.",0965-8564,Not found
Optimal infrastructure reinvestment in urban rail systems: A dynamic supply optimisation approach,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.009,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The state of infrastructure in many developed countries around the world is an increasingly pressing issue, with mounting costs the longer repairs are deferred. In today’s rapidly urbanising world, the urban rail network is particularly critical, since infrastructure failures can have severe economic consequences for both the operator’s finances and user time costs. This paper thus provides a system-level model of welfare-oriented supply optimisation that integrates asset management with the literature on optimal pricing and capacity provision. Using a simulation approach and calibrating with London Underground data, this paper delivers three key contributions. First, the economic efficiency of long-term capital planning is highlighted, with up to an 87% welfare gain when comparing a 40- versus 5-year planning horizon. Second, in general, the longer the planning horizon, the higher the annual welfare, demand, asset condition, fare and supply, in the steady-state. Third, the analysis explores why policies in reality diverge from the welfare optimum: we show that election cycles can have a detrimental effect, with increased asset neglect and volatility in spending. Economic efficiency improves in the short-term at the expense of the long-term; significant intervention is needed to break this downwards trend, as also reflected in various rail systems’ histories.",0965-8564,Not found

These methods are applied to the outcomes of a stated choice experiment, which was designed to survey the iterative airport choice process under hesitancy. The results indicate that a quarter of the passengers show evidence of hesitancy. Further, the deep reinforcement learning approach is found to provide the highest accuracy in representing the stated choices; the random forests algorithm also gives good results in capturing the reconsideration decision, while the multinomial logit model seems less accurate in representing the choice behavior of interest.

Impact of a Preliminary Feasibility Study on the accuracy of traffic forecasts in the case of Korea,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.013,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The financial crisis that beset the Republic of Korea in late 1997 had a tremendous impact on the nation’s economy. In an effort to resolve the fundamental causes of this crisis, one fiscal reform, executed with the goal of improving the efficacy of government investment, was the introduction of the Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS). PFS was initiated to determine which projects to fund in a transparent and fair way through preliminarily examinations and evaluation of the feasibility of large-scale government projects. This study assesses the achievements of PFS by investigating improvements in the accuracy of traffic forecasting results and analyzing the determinants of traffic forecasting errors in PFS. The traffic forecasting data include 42 road projects for which PFS were conducted and 113 road projects that were not subject to PFS and for which forecasts and actual out-turns were available. The results reveal that 41.3% of traffic forecasts were overestimated before the introduction of PFS. This statistic contrasts with the traffic forecasting error rate of 14.53% since PFS became mandatory. Moreover, traffic forecasts of PFS projects were also unbiased. By analyzing the determinants of traffic forecasting errors in PFS projects using the random forest approach, we also found that the characteristics of the project manager and forecaster, and the influence of politicians or political groups, had minimal effect on traffic forecasting errors. We conclude that PFS enhances the accuracy of traffic forecasts and prevents the initiation of inefficient transportation projects. Our study fills a gap in the existing literature because few studies have focused on the various factors affecting traffic forecasting error based on data and econometrics. This study also examines the effects of policy measures to mitigate overestimation and increase traffic forecasting accuracy. Our results emphasize the significant role of analysts, the need for credible guidelines and an independent evaluation institution, and the importance of a robust governance system in public investment management.",0965-8564,Not found
E-scooter sharing to serve short-distance transit trips: A Singapore case,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.004,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"E-scooter sharing provides a last-mile solution to complement transit services,butless was known about its effectiveness in serving short-distance transit trips. We investigate the potential of using e-scooter sharing to replace short-distance transit trips of excessive indirectness, multiple transfers, and long access-egress walking. First, we conducted a stated preference survey on e-scooter users in the Central Area of Singapore and estimated mixed logit models to examine factors influencing the choice of e-scooters and transit. We then calculated the number of transit trips that can be replaced by e-scooters. Second, we analyzed the decision of e-scooter companies in terms of the trade-offs between serving more e-scooter trips and making more revenue under varying fares. The results show that fare, MRT transfer, and MRT access-egress walking distance have significantly negative impacts on mode utilities with random tastes among respondents. Male, young and high-income groups are more heterogeneous in e-scooter preferences compared with other groups. The loss of mode share can be nearly 17% if maximizing the revenue. We classify trade-off situations into five categories and provide suggestions of how to balance between mode share and revenue for each category. Several implications are drawn for better harnessing and regulating this new mobility service, including where to deploy e-scooters to satisfy the demand unmet by the transit and how to reach a proper balance between private operators and public welfare.",0965-8564,Not found
The economic impacts of restricting black carbon emissions on cargo shipping in the Polar Code Area,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.017,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Since black carbon (BC) has become one of the most harmful pollutants and partly accelerated the melting of the Arctic sea ice, internationally mandatory policy to limit black carbon emissions in the whole Polar Code Area is on the agenda. To cope with this policy, some potential measures from both the coastal government and the shipowners, as well as the economic impacts of these measures, are considered in this paper. We analyze the daily navigation profits and the corresponding BC emissions after these measures are adopted. Since equipment-related cost is usually regarded as fixed and cannot be calculated on a daily basis, this paper also proposes an equipment investment payback period to access the time needed to achieve a balance between the investments and the profits of applying the equipment. A case of a dry bulk carrier navigating through the Northwest Passage is presented for concrete quantitative analysis. The results indicate that wind propulsion system can help shipowners mitigate the largest amount of BC emission. Wind-driven generators, which are used for auxiliary generating system, are the most economic-beneficial to shipowners under the current technology environment. Besides, we found that BC emission tax rate set by coastal governments plays an important role in the selection of different measures by shipowners.",0965-8564,Not found
Heterogeneity in passenger satisfaction with air-rail integration services: Results of a finite mixture partial least squares model,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.003,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Air-rail integration services (ARIS) are a promising solution for intermodal travel, but they also offer challenges such as trip complexity and uncertainty that may negatively impact passenger satisfaction. This paper addresses the quality evaluation of ARIS with a twofold purpose, specifically, (1) to explore the causal relationships between the psychological and behavioral variables of passengers and (2) to identify different passenger groups for precise service improvements. The relationships among passenger expectations, perceived quality, perceived value, satisfaction, complaints and loyalty are hypothesized and analyzed by using a passenger satisfaction index (PSI) model based on a representative sample of 1,345 intermodal passengers at Shijiazhuang Zhengding International Airport (SJW). Next, a finite mixture partial least squares (FIMIX-PLS) technique is applied to explore the heterogeneity. The results suggest that perceived quality, perceived value and passenger expectations have a positive effect on passenger satisfaction, which, in turn, influences passenger loyalty and complaints. Moreover, three passenger segments are found, namely, “perceived value and expectation-oriented passengers”, “perceived quality-oriented passengers”, and “satisfied loyal-conscious passengers”. Interestingly, an overall similarity in the perceived quality among the three passenger segments is observed with the importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) method. Nevertheless, some noticeable differences in the psychological-behavioral relationships of the three passenger segments are identified. Finally, managerial implications are discussed.",0965-8564,Not found
Unveiling daily activity pattern differences between telecommuters and commuters using human mobility motifs and sequence analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.002,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"This paper demonstrates the use of motif and sequence analysis in tandem to analyse differences and commonalities between telecommuters and usual commuters. In terms of substantive findings, telecommuters are by far more diverse in their allocation of time to places, activities, and travel. Approximately 20% of telecommuters stay at home all day during a workday, while only 8% of commuters do. Telecommuters that have at least one trip during their workday accrue more vehicle miles travelled and number of trips than their commuter counterparts. However, they travel less driving alone and tend to have more complex schedules visiting more locations. Within telecommuters and commuters, however, we have substantial variation in activity participation and travel captured by the combination of motifs and sequence analysis. As expected, a substantial proportion of commuters display morning and afternoon peaks of arriving at and departing from work, and telecommuters do not show this pattern. In addition, telecommuters do not only perform work tasks from home. Instead, during a day a high percentage travel to a variety of locations to either visit customers and/or use their spatio-temporal schedule flexibility to perform work tasks from locations other than home. In contrast, more than 80% of commuters perform work at their workplace. In addition, a slightly higher proportion of telecommuters function as the designated driver escorting other people to their activity locations.",0965-8564,Not found
An event-based probabilistic model of disruption risk to urban metro networks,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.010,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Metro systems serve large populations and form extensive networks. Incidents such as signal failure, train failure, and power failure, pose great challenges to the reliable operation of metro systems around the world. For the Beijing metro system, incidents caused 408 disruptions of train services from 2014 to 2018. These incidents are investigated in detail, and a Monte Carlo approach and incident parameter functions are used to generate stochastically simulated incident events. Based on the simulated incidents, combined passenger flow data and an input-output model, we estimate the risk associated with the Beijing metro system in terms of disrupted passenger flows by considering risk propagation in the network, where both direct passenger loss and indirect passenger flow loss considering interchanges between different lines are considered. Lines at high risk are identified, and a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effects of risk mitigation measures. This study provides a generic risk modeling method for urban metro systems and can improve decision making to manage metro system risk.",0965-8564,Not found
"Exploring shopping travel behavior of millennials in Beijing: Impacts of built environment, life stages, and subjective preferences",10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.012,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"China’s cities have witnessed rapid growth of the consumption economy in recent years. The millennials (defined in this study as those born between 1980 and 2000, also known as Generation Y) have become one of the main forces of domestic consumption. Thus, shopping trips of millennials significantly influence the transportation sector in the context of the consumption society. Previous studies intensively investigated the determinants of non-work travel. However, only a few empirical analyses were conducted on the shopping travel behavior of millennials in China’s cities. In addition, few studies integrated the influence of life stages and shopping habits in their analysis of travel behavior. The purpose of the study is to fill these research gaps by taking Beijing as a case. By using travel survey data in Beijing, this study explores the characteristics and determinants of shopping travel by millennials. A multinomial logistic (MNL) model is applied to investigate the travel mode choice of millennials for shopping purposes. A latent class (LC) model is used to further specify segment preferences according to individual life stages and shopping habits. The impacts of several major factors are addressed. These factors include neighborhood built environments, individual subjective attitudes toward travel, and household attributes. Results show that the completed commercial facilities and public transportation connections surrounding the neighborhoods would encourage shopping by walking or cycling. The findings and conclusions could enhance the knowledge of millennials’ travel behavior and contribute to policy-making to encourage sustainable transport by integrating land use and transportation planning strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
Relevance of detailed transfer attributes in large-scale multimodal route choice models for metropolitan public transport passengers,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.010,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Given the aim of increasing public transport patronage, it is important to understand how passengers perceive different trip characteristics. Most of the existing studies about public transport demand and route choice assigned a higher value of time to transfers than in-vehicle time and used a general transfer penalty to capture an average increase in the travel disutility because of the amount of transfers. However, it is likely that there are nuances to the transfer behaviour depending on specific transfer conditions that existing models do not capture and hence it is difficult to evaluate measures aimed at improving transfers to make public transport more attractive. This study presents a route choice model for the large-scale multimodal public transport network in the Greater Copenhagen Region where a variety of transfer attributes were explicitly considered within a unified model framework. The model was estimated on an extensive revealed dataset of 4,810 observed routes that made it possible to evaluate the rates of substitution of transfer related attributes. The results revealed that travellers do consider attributes for transfers such as ease of wayfinding, presence of shops and escalators at stations when choosing routes in the public transport network and this influences the attractiveness of the respective routes with a quite large range of the transfer penalty from 5.4 min compared to bus in-vehicle time for the best possible transfer to 12.1 min for the worst. Furthermore, the study revealed some differences in the preferences for transfer attributes across passengers. This suggest a quite large potential for improving transfers and hence public transport patronage focusing on the attributes of the transfers.",0965-8564,Not found
Travel preferences of public transport users under uneven headways,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.012,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Public transport is affected by different types of randomness which impact the reliability they offer. The source of this randomness may come, for example, from casual uncertainty sources, such as accidents or protests, or from systematic uncertainty, related to service supply, such as dwelling time or travel time between consecutive stops. In addition to these sources of variability, an extra source of uncertainty experienced by users arises due to the public transport vehicle not being immediately available to avoid a wait of uncertain length. In a frequency-based system (without schedules), even under perfect regularity, users are not sure about the next vehicle's time of arrival. This article aims to find out the impact that reliability has on travellers’ public transport alternative choice. To do so, an experiment of stated preferences is carried out, where the design characteristics are four operational attributes: speed, frequency, headway regularity, and average demand. Every scenario is randomly generated, based on the operational characteristics of the specific scenario. This means the alternatives presented resemble real-life operation and they are different between respondents. A Hybrid Discrete Choice Model was estimated, which addresses preference heterogeneity by considering two latent attitudes: punctual behaviour and crowding aversion. Overall, results indicate that headway irregularity has a significant effect on travellers’ choices, both in terms of waiting time and passenger density. This confirms this attribute should not be ignored in any public transport model, especially when it comes to evaluate projects which improve the system’s reliability but not necessary its average level of service.",0965-8564,Not found
Why do consumers choose to buy electric vehicles? A paired data analysis of purchase intention configurations,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.014,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Understanding the driving factors associated with electric vehicle (EV) purchases is a prerequisite for governments and firms to develop corresponding policy interventions and marketing strategies. However, prior studies primarily focus on the individual role of psychological and policy attributes, and there has been limited research on how the combinations or configurations of psychological and policy attributes jointly influence consumers’ EV purchase intentions. To fill this gap, we draw on the configurational theory to develop a research framework by integrating three psychological attributes (i.e., attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) and four policy attributes (i.e., purchase subsidies, license plate control, preferential usage, and preferential driving). We build a paired dataset with both qualitative and quantitative data. Using the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) approach, the empirical results from China reveal that configurations of attributes that lead to high EV purchase intention always include at least one psychological attribute. In contrast, even if a government has implemented purchase subsidies, the joint absences of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control lead to low EV purchase intention. We also provide interesting insights into different sociodemographic characteristics. We contribute to EV adoption literature by revealing the configurations of attributes associated with EV purchase intention from a new theoretical perspective. Our findings assist policymakers in developing potential alternatives when faced with policy adjustment.",0965-8564,Not found

Although several studies have investigated the influence of changes in the built environment of the residential environment, the complex relationships between the built environment, travel attitudes and travel behavior has remained controversial. One crucial research gap in this area is the paucity of longitudinal and semi-longitudinal research designs that could capture the influence of changes in the built environment, activity space dispersion, car and bike ownership, latent attitudes towards travel, as well as travel behavior, and the interrelationships between these factors. This study attempts to fill this gap by collecting retrospective travel behavior and attitudinal data in Helsinki Metropolitan Area using an online map-based survey tool. In total, 1321 residents who had relocated to a new residential location between three to eleven months prior to the survey date participated in the study. The study collected data related to common home-based trips during a typical week in September 2017 and September 2018, stated change in the use of different modes of transport after the move, as well as socio-demographic, and attitudinal data before and after the move. Based on residential location and the visited destinations during a typical week, respondents’ activity space dispersion was measured. Structural equation modelling was then used to investigate the interrelationships between changes in the built environment, activity space dispersion, car and bike ownership, travel attitudes, and travel behavior. Results indicate the existence of reciprocal influences between changes in car and bike ownership, travel attitudes, and travel behavior. It is also found that the built environment can modify and change travel related attitudes and influence activity space dispersion, which in turn affects travel behavior. The results of this study support the effectiveness of nudging approaches rather than marketing activities in changing travel attitudes and encouraging sustainable travel behavior.",0965-8564,Not found
Taking the path less travelled: Valuation of denied boarding in crowded public transport systems,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.007,147,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Many public transport networks worldwide experience high crowding levels. Overcrowding can result in passengers not able to board the first arriving vehicle. We infer how waiting time induced by being denied boarding in crowded public transport systems is valued by passengers, based on observed passenger route choice behaviour. For this purpose, we estimate a revealed preference route choice model based on passenger and vehicle movement data. As denied boarding typically occurs only at specific locations and within strict time bands, whilst its occurrence is notoriously uncertain, we propose additional constraints to generate an appropriate choice set for which observed route choices can be used to estimate denied boarding perceptions. We found that the additional waiting time caused by denied boarding is valued 68% more negatively compared to the initial waiting time. On average, one minute of initial and denied boarding wait time are perceived as 1.62 and 2.72 min on-board an uncrowded vehicle, respectively. Not incorporating this more negative denied boarding wait time valuation can result in an underestimation of the passenger and societal impact of overcrowding in public transport systems. Moreover, it can underestimate the benefits of potential crowding relief measures and as such underestimate the benefit-cost ratio of these measures.",0965-8564,Not found

Parking meter data and survey data are used to analyze the impact of the policy intervention on parking demand and user satisfaction, respectively. Regression discontinuity design (RDD), structural equation model (SEM), and binary logistic regression (BLR) models are implemented. Results show that the increase in parking pricing significantly decreases the parking volume (by around 20%) and parking duration (by around 10%). Drivers’ parking costs also increased. The influence varies across different sub-areas, days of the week, and trip purposes. After the policy adjustment, people feel that the parking price is higher, the distance of parking lots to the final destination is closer, and the parking lots are more vacant. On-street parking users after the policy intervention have higher incomes. As they are less sensitive to the price but more on quality, the overall parking satisfaction is increased.",0965-8564,Not found

Re-visiting residential self-selection and dissonance: Does intra-household decision-making change the results?,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.018,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"A considerable amount of literature has discussed the relevance of travel attitudes for location choices and travel behavior. Numerous studies have reported evidence that individuals choose neighborhoods that allow them to travel with their preferred transport mode, a process referred to as residential self-selection. Most studies, however, assume homogeneous attitudes and preferences among household members and ignore negotiation processes between partners that influence travel and location choices. The goal of this study is to investigate the extent to which heterogeneity in attitudes between partners affect residential self-selection and residential dissonance. This study uses data from a travel survey conducted in the agglomeration area of Vienna (Austria), factor analyses and multinomial logit models to explore residential location and mode choices. Descriptive analysis reveals that depending on the neighborhood type travel attitudes have different effects on mode choice. Heterogeneity in travel attitudes between partners partly explains limited evidence of residential self-selection and dissonance. In general, effects of residential dissonance on location choice are most relevant if both partners are dissonant. Surprisingly, only women’s travel attitudes substantially influence neighborhood selection which may be explained by the fact that female partners are also more affected by neighborhood characteristics in their travel behavior than their male partners. One third of respondents does not live in neighborhoods that match their travel attitudes. More dissonant households live in suburban areas than in the urban core indicating potential pressures on the housing market. Policy implications of these results emphasize the relevance of gender and highlight the challenge of providing affordable housing with good mobility services.",0965-8564,Not found
Investigating autonomous vehicle impacts on individual activity-travel behavior,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.006,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This paper develops an analytic system to investigate the effects of AV availability on multiple dimensions of activity-travel behavior at once, based on a direct survey-based modeling approach. In particular, the model uses individual socio-demographics, built environment variables, as well as psycho-social variables (in the form of latent psychological constructs) as determinant variables to explain likely AV impacts on five dimensions of short-term activity-travel choices: (1) Additional local area trips (that is, those that would not characterized as long distance trips; a long distance trip was defined in the survey as a trip more than 75 miles one-way), (2) Trip distance to shop or eat-out activities in the local area, (3) Trip distance to leisure activities in the local area, (4) Additional long distance road trips beyond the local area, and (5) Commute travel time. The model system includes a confirmatory factor analysis step, a multivariate linear regression model for the latent constructs, and a multivariate ordered-response model for the five main outcomes just listed. Data from a 2019 Austin area survey of new mobility service adoption and use forms the basis for our empirical analysis. Our results, when aggregated across all respondents, does suggest that AVs may not after all have a substantial impact on overall trip-making levels, although local area trips are likely to become longer (for all purposes, including the commute). The highest impact of AVs will, it appears, be on the number of long distance trips (with such trips increasing). Our in-depth examination of the variations in AV activity-travel responses across population segments and geographies underscores the importance of modeling multiple activity-travel dimensions all at once. In addition, our results highlight the value of using psycho-social latent constructs in studies related to the adoption/use of current and emerging mobility services, both in terms of improved prediction fit as well as proactive strategies to design equitable, safe, and community-driven AV systems. There is likely to be considerable heterogeneity in how different population groups view and respond to AVs, and it is imperative that AV campaigns and AV design consider such heterogeneity so as to not “leave anyone behind”.",0965-8564,Not found
On the fundamental diagram and driving behavior modeling of heterogeneous traffic flow using UAV-based data,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.001,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"A significant difference in the behavior of heterogeneous and undisciplined traffic streams is observed when compared with the conventional traffic flow. Most of the existing traffic flow models are developed considering the traffic stream with strict lane discipline. Several studies from South Asian countries have reported high heterogeneity in the traffic stream with weak or no lane discipline. This study, for the first time, develops fundamental traffic flow diagrams for the heterogeneous and undisciplined traffic stream by analyzing traffic videos captured using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in Karachi, Pakistan. UAV-based speed-density data is modeled using a weighted least-square regression technique, and stochastic fundamental diagrams (FDs) are developed to represent the entire range of speed-density data. The stochastic FDs are used to determine the 85th percentile speeds to implement speed limits on major urban arterials. The multi-modal FDs show a significant difference in the behavior of different modes in the traffic stream. The aggressive behavior of motorbike riders, which put them at a higher risk of accidents, highlights the need for policy measures to enforce discipline in the traffic stream. The main contribution of this study is the utilization of a UAV-based geospatial analysis technique for accurate extraction of longitudinal and lateral distances between vehicles to determine the relationship between macroscopic and microscopic parameters of traffic flow. This study shows that lateral gaps between vehicles are inversely related to traffic density. The longitudinal gaps observed for local heterogeneous traffic show a significant difference with the longitudinal gaps estimated using a standard car-following model. The macroscopic and microscopic models for heterogeneous and undisciplined traffic flow presented in this study could be useful in developing novel traffic flow models and calibrating the existing microscopic/ macroscopic traffic flow models for the traffic streams with similar heterogeneity and lane behavior.",0965-8564,Not found
Commuter demand estimation and feasibility assessment for Urban Air Mobility in Northern California,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.020,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This study aims to estimate passenger demand for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and analyze the feasibility of operating the system in Northern California. UAM is a concept mode of transportation that is designed to bypass ground congestion for time-sensitive, price-inelastic travelers using autonomous, electric aircraft with Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capabilities. This study focuses specifically on commuting trips, which are frequent and considered relatively more time-sensitive than other types of personal trips. The UAM mode's feasibility is studied using sensitivity analysis of UAM demand to cost per passenger mile and the number of vertiports placed in the region. This study also explores the spatial distribution of UAM demand in Northern California, which further helps in identifying the major commuter trip-attraction and trip-production zones for the UAM mode in the region. The results indicate that sufficient UAM demand for commuting trips can only be reached at optimistically low UAM offered fares. These fare levels could be challenging to obtain given the high real estate cost in Northern California's urban regions. Moreover, the reliability of the UAM mode must be comparable to the automobile mode; otherwise, it loses significant demand with increasing delays. The results also show that the commuting flows with promising UAM demand in Northern California are heavily one-directional, with San Francisco Financial District being a major attraction. Other types of trips should also be considered along with commuting trips to generate an economically viable system and reduce deadheading.",0965-8564,Not found

In this paper, we take up and apply the concept of excess travel (i.e., the travel beyond what would be required given a more optimal distribution of housing and schools) to examine the extent to which students with disability and their families are required to undertake longer, more time-consuming school trips. Our analysis includes students who were bused to TDSB elementary (grade school) and secondary (high school) schools. We use TDSB student busing records for the 2016–17 school year obtained in collaboration with the TDSB between December 2017 and March 2018. Our findings indicate substantial excess travel, particularly for students who are labelled as deaf, physically disabled, or having a behavioural exceptionality. Excess travel time experienced by students with disability is concerning given that it can lead to missed classroom time and may limit opportunities for peer interaction.

Mobility-on-demand versus fixed-route transit systems: An evaluation of traveler preferences in low-income communities,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.019,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Emerging transportation technologies such as ridesourcing services (i.e. Uber, Lyft, and Via) are disrupting the transportation sector and transforming public transit. Some transit observers envision future public transit to be integrated systems with fixed-route services running along major corridors and ridesourcing servicing lower-density areas. A switch from a conventional fixed-route service model to this kind of integrated Mobility-on-Demand (MOD) transit system, however, may elicit varied responses from residents. This paper evaluates traveler preferences for a proposed integrated MOD transit system versus the existing fixed-route system, with a particular focus on disadvantaged travelers. We conducted a survey in two low-income localities, namely, Detroit and Ypsilanti, Michigan. A majority of survey respondents preferred a MOD transit system over a fixed-route one. Results of ordered logit models revealed a stronger preference for MOD transit among males, college graduates, and individuals who currently receive inferior transit services and have used Uber/Lyft before. By contrast, preferences varied little by age, income, race, or disability status. Survey results further imply that low technology self-efficacy can be a more serious barrier for many people to adopt MOD transit than lacking access to bank accounts, smartphones, or the internet. The most important benefit of MOD transit perceived by respondents is enhanced accessibility to destinations, whereas their major concerns include the need to actively request rides, possible transit-fare increases, and potential technological failures. Addressing the concerns of female riders and accommodating the needs of less technology-proficient individuals should be priorities for transit agencies that are considering MOD initiatives.",0965-8564,Not found
MaaS users: Who they are and how much they are willing-to-pay,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.016,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) is a concept that has gained popularity and interest in the last few years. A significant determinant of the successful integration of a MaaS scheme is demand from passengers and potential users.

An online survey in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom is utilized in order to explore and model such preferences and choices. Data from the survey includes socio-demographic data, current travel patterns, and a menu-based, stated preference experiment where the users were able to design their ideal MaaS plan.

Results of the paper shed light into demand and quantitative analysis regarding MaaS, which the current literature lacks and outlines a price range for mobility services which is close to relevant literature in other locations for public transport and car-sharing and provides WTP estimates for taxi and bike-sharing.

Time-dependent transit fare optimization with elastic and spatially distributed demand,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.002,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Motivated by the lack of microeconomic models that optimize time-dependent transit fares based on realistic demand formulations, this paper presents a microeconomic model for the design of a time-dependent transit pricing scheme considering elastic and spatiotemporally distributed demand. To model the spatial distribution of demand, a transit line with multiple origin–destination pairs is considered. To model the cyclical demand fluctuations, transit operations in one day are divided into multiple time periods. In the proposed model we optimize fares, headway, vehicle capacity, and maximum fleet size, with the objective of maximizing social welfare, subject to fleet size and vehicle capacity constraints. We find time-dependent pricing could avoid cross-subsidization among travelers in different time periods. Under both pricing schemes, the time-dependent headways satisfy the same optimality condition: the total rider waiting cost equals the total fixed cost on the supplier side. We also demonstrate that both resource constraints (vehicle capacity and fleet size) can be binding in multiple time periods, unlike the usual assumption in the literature that resource constraints are binding only in the period with the highest demand. Two extensions (considering a financial constraint and a variable roundtrip time) are also investigated. The developed models can be used to facilitate the design of time-dependent pricing schemes for practical applications.",0965-8564,Not found
A practical approach for curbing congestion and air pollution: Driving restrictions with toll and vintage exemptions,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.011,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Congestion and local air pollution continue to be a serious problem in many cities around the world, partly because of an increasing and ageing car fleet. Unfortunately, the use of pricing schemes for handling these externalities, such as congestion and pollution charges, still face much resistance. To cope with it, Carlos F. Daganzo advanced an ingenious hybrid scheme that supposedly leaves everybody better off: driving restrictions with toll exemptions. We extend Daganzo’s idea to include vintage exemptions in an effort to also control for the pollution externality. We then test for its Pareto-improving property using Santiago as a case study. We find the latter not to hold in that low-income drivers are strictly worse off: the gain from faster car travel in days of no restriction is not enough to compensate the loss from switching to public transport in days of restriction. To make all individuals better off, the entire toll collection ought to be recycled back into the public transport system, lowering its fares and improving its quality. If so, the most ambitious hybrid restriction format —a 5-day-a-week restriction with vintage thresholds during fall and winter— reports per-year net benefits of around 1.2 billion dollars (or 0.5% of the country’s GDP), 58% of which comes from lighter traffic and the remaining 42% from cleaner air.",0965-8564,Not found
Providing real-time bus crowding information for passengers: A novel policy to promote high-frequency transit performance,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.007,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Bus bunching is of particular concern and undesirable for both operators and passengers in high-frequency transit. In contrast to existing control methods, this paper proposes a novel control policy, namely, providing real-time bus crowding information (BCI) for passengers. It is believed that passengers would spontaneously distribute more evenly among buses and help to prevent bus bunching with the provision of BCI accompanying arrival time information due to the following mechanism. A proportion of passengers would be likely to wait a few more minutes for the next bus when the current bus is crowded and the next bus is more comfortable, and the boarding times of these passengers would make the next bus dwell longer and increase its headway from the previous bus. We formulate bus motion models incorporating passenger boarding choice under BCI to realize the policy in simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that the policy can reduce operation instability by approximately 20% in terms of bus headway and single-trip time. In addition, this policy can significantly reduce the in-vehicle crowdedness experienced by passengers by up to 25% at the cost of small increases in the mean journey time in some cases. The simulation experiments on a holding-controlled route also indicate that the proposed policy is able to coordinate with holding well. A sensitivity analysis further confirms that the policy’s performance is robust even if the passengers have low inclinations to choose the next bus. The policy of providing BCI in this paper is especially effective for bus routes with high passenger demand and may have great application potential in practice.",0965-8564,Not found
Updating and transferring Random Effect models: The case of operating speed percentile estimation,10.1016/j.tra.2021.01.008,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Random Effect (RE) models are used for analyzing data that are non-independent or when data are characterized by a hierarchical structure. In traffic and highway engineering, RE models have been successfully employed to estimate free-flow speed distributions from data containing observations that are naturally nested according to different levels (i.e. direction, sections, roads). Empirical studies conducted on both urban arterials and rural two-lane highways have shown that RE models, by properly accounting for the survey design, are superior to traditional Fixed Effect (FE) models. However, RE models are non-transferable because of the unknown RE value for roads or road sections belonging to a different network or road of the same network that were not originally used to develop the model. In this paper, the transferability of RE models to road sections that were not in the original sample used for model estimation was studied, under the assumption that for these additional sections very few observations are available or can be collected. This problem poses two challenges. First, random effects for the new road sections should be estimated in order to make out-of-sample predictions. Second, the original model formulation makes use of speed quantiles as predictors of the linear model which are not readily available for the new sections. The method proposed estimates an auxiliary model, in which the RE of the original model are correlated to the RE to be defined for the new section, with the former being used to predict the latter. The RE pairs are modeled jointly, taking advantage of their potential mutual correlation. The model coefficients obtained are also validated using a jackknife technique. Results show that the method converges quite fast and that a handful of observations for the new road section are sufficient for good RE estimates.",0965-8564,Not found
Integrated weather effects on e-cycling in daily commuting: A longitudinal evaluation of weather effects on e-cycling in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.003,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"While in many regions the conventional bicycle has already been regarded as an environmentally friendly and healthy alternative to the car for daily commuting, societal and policy agendas are also increasingly promoting e-bike adoption. Adding to recent research on e-bike safety, satisfaction with travel and behavioral change, this paper reports on the impact of weather circumstances on the use of the e-bike in daily commuting in an e-cycling incentive program in the province of Noord-Brabant, the Netherlands. The impact of this incentive program was analyzed using a longitudinal design, and it combined travel patterns that were derived from individuals’ GPS data over nine months, hourly observed meteorological data, and questionnaires on intended behavior and sociodemographic characteristics. The findings suggest that the presence of snow and ice, total precipitation, and high windspeed negatively affected the choice of commuting to work by e-bike, in this decreasing order of impact. Although the overall impact of air temperature on e-cycling was positive, the likeliness to commute by e-bike decreased at higher air temperatures. E-cycling under specific weather conditions was more likely if participants’ intention to e-cycle under such weather conditions was stronger. Our study indicates that the benefits of the e-bike in daily commuting are underestimated in relation to adverse weather conditions. Respondents from households with one car only, therefore, have fewer alternatives in poor weather conditions: for these individuals, only total precipitation and the presence of relatively low air temperature impact e-cycling. In addition, reported gender and high wind speeds might have been expected to influence participation in e-cycling.",0965-8564,Not found
Charging infrastructure roll-out strategies for large scale introduction of electric vehicles in urban areas: An agent-based simulation study,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.010,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"On the eve of the large-scale introduction of electric vehicles, policy makers have to decide on how to organise a significant growth in charging infrastructure to meet demand. There is uncertainty about which charging deployment tactic to follow. The main issue is how many of charging stations, of which type, should be installed and where. Early roll-out has been successful in many places, but knowledge on how to plan a large-scale charging network in urban areas is missing. Little is known about return to scale effects, reciprocal effects of charger availability on sales, and the impact of fast charging or more clustered charging hubs on charging preferences of EV owners. This paper explores the effects of various roll-out strategies for charging infrastructure that facilitate the large-scale introduction of EVs, using agent-based simulation. In contrast to previously proposed models, our model is rooted in empirically observed charging patterns from EVs instead of travel patterns of fossil fuelled cars. In addition, the simulation incorporates different user types (inhabitants, visitors, taxis and shared vehicles) to model the diversity of charging behaviours in an urban environment. Different scenarios are explored along the lines of the type of charging infrastructure (level 2, clustered level 2, fast charging) and the intensity of rollout (EV to charging point ratio). The simulation predicts both the success rate of charging attempts and the additional discomfort when searching for a charging station. Results suggest that return to scale and reciprocal effects in charging infrastructure are considerable, resulting in a lower EV to charging station ratio on the longer term.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact of congestion charge and minimum wage on TNCs: A case study for San Francisco,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.008,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This paper describes the impact on transportation network companies (TNCs) of the imposition of a congestion charge and a driver minimum wage. The impact is assessed using a market equilibrium model to calculate the changes in the number of passenger trips and trip fare, number of drivers employed, the TNC platform profit, the number of TNC vehicles, and city revenue. Two types of charges are considered: (a) a charge per TNC trip similar to an excise tax, and (b) a charge per vehicle operating hour (whether or not it has a passenger) similar to a road tax. Both charges reduce the number of TNC trips, but this reduction is limited by the wage floor, and the number of TNC vehicles reduced is not significant. The time-based charge is preferable to the trip-based charge since, by penalizing idle vehicle time, the former increases vehicle occupancy. In a case study for San Francisco, the time-based charge is found to be Pareto superior to the trip-based charge as it yields higher passenger surplus, higher platform profits, and higher tax revenue for the city.",0965-8564,Not found
Measuring policy leakage of Beijing's car ownership restriction,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.008,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"In response to severe traffic congestion and air pollution, Beijing introduced a car ownership restriction policy to curb growth in the number of private cars in the city. However, Beijing residents can still purchase and register their cars in neighboring cities and this “leakage” may substantially reduce the policy’s effectiveness. Using city-level data collected from the CEIC China Premium Database, we aim to quantify the spill-over effect: the impact of Beijing’s policy on the growth of private car registrations in neighboring cities. We first deploy a synthetic control method to create a weighted combination of non-treated cities for each treated city. We then employ a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the policy leakage. Our models suggest that the policy resulted in additional 443,000 cars sold in the neighboring cities (within 500 km of Beijing) from 2011 to 2013, compared to if the policy had not been implemented. 35–40% of the car growth reduction stipulated by the policy simply spilled over to neighboring cities.

Distributional impact of a regional road pricing scheme in Flanders,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.014,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This paper uses a combination of a regional computable general equilibrium model(EDIP) and a household micro-simulation model (EUROMOD) to assess the welfare effects of a transport tax reform. The transport tax reform replaces current car fuel and ownership taxes by a road charge differentiated by time and place. This is combined with five realistic tax recycling scenarios that can be ordered by their degree of progressivity. The net revenues are used to reduce taxes on labour. The tax reform leads to modest increases in real wage, disposable income and GDP, while reducing external costs of transport. Using the combination of general equilibrium modelling with micro-simulation we can go into more detail on the distributive impact of the road tax reform. Where other authors have found progressive or mildly regressive impacts of road charging, we find that within each income group there is a wide divergence of positively and negatively affected households. As such, the support or opposition for a road charging policy may depend more on the profile of the car user than on the relative ranking of the user in the income distribution.",0965-8564,Not found
"To Pool or Not to Pool? Understanding opportunities, challenges, and equity considerations to expanding the market for pooling",10.1016/j.tra.2020.10.007,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"On-demand mobility services such as bikesharing, scooter sharing, and transportation network companies (TNCs, also known as ridesourcing and ridehailing) are changing the way that people travel by providing dynamic, on-demand mobility that can supplement public transit and personal-vehicle use. Adoption of on-demand mobility has soared across the United States and abroad, driven by the flexibility and affordability that these services offer, particularly in urban areas where population density and land use patterns facilitate a reliable balance of supply and demand. The growth of app-based ridesharing, microtransit, and TNCs presents a unique opportunity to reduce congestion, energy use, and emissions through reduced personal vehicle ownership and increased vehicle occupancy, the latter of which is largely dependent on the decisions of individual travelers to pool or not to pool. This research provides key insights into the policy levers that could be employed to reduce vehicle miles traveled and emissions by incentivizing the use of pooled on-demand ride services and public transit. We employ a general population stated preference survey of four California metropolitan regions (Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, and the San Francisco Bay Area) to examine the opportunities and challenges for drastically expanding the market for pooling, taking into account the nuances in emergent travel behavior and demand sensitivity across on-demand mobility options. Although high-frequency TNC users – those that use TNCs once a week or more - are more likely to consider pooling than less frequent users and reflect more multimodal travel behavior than other travelers, we find that the most captive and price sensitive TNC users are often the most vulnerable. Heavy TNC users – those using TNCs more than three days per week - are disproportionately low income, more likely not to own or lease a car and more likely to use TNCs for essential trip purposes than are less frequent users. Pooling demand sensitivity varies significantly across trip contexts, metropolitan regions, socio-demographics, travel behavior, and attitudes and perceptions toward sharing. We estimate the time and price tradeoffs in choosing between ride alone and shared on-demand service options, finding significant differences across values that travelers place on each component of travel time (wait time, access/egress walking time, and in-vehicle time) by geography and income level. We discuss the potential to leverage these insights to develop policies that combine pricing, curb management, and promotional strategies to increase the pooling market share.",0965-8564,Not found
Autonomous delivery vehicles to fight the spread of Covid-19 – How do men and women differ in their acceptance?,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.020,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Covid-19 seriously impacts and endangers lives of millions worldwide.

On bus ridership and frequency,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.005,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Even before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bus ridership in the United States had attained its lowest level since 1973. If transit agencies hope to reverse this trend, they must understand how their service allocation policies affect ridership. This paper is among the first to model ridership trends on a hyper-local level over time. A Poisson fixed-effects model is developed to evaluate the ridership elasticity to frequency on weekdays using passenger count data from Portland, Miami, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta between 2012 and 2018. In every agency, ridership is found to be elastic to frequency when observing the variation between individual route-segments at one point in time. In other words, the most frequent routes are already the most productive in terms of passengers per vehicle-trip. When observing the variation within each route-segment over time, however, ridership is inelastic; each additional vehicle-trip is expected to generate less ridership than the average bus already on the route. In three of the four agencies, the elasticity is a decreasing function of prior frequency, meaning that low-frequency routes are the most sensitive to changes in frequency. This paper can help transit agencies anticipate the marginal effect of shifting service throughout the network. As the quality and availability of passenger count data improve, this paper can serve as the methodological basis to explore the dynamics of bus ridership.",0965-8564,Not found
Impacts of real-time information levels in public transport: A large-scale case study using an adaptive passenger path choice model,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.011,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Public transport services are often uncertain, causing passengers’ travel times and routes to vary from day to day. However, since door-to-door passenger delays depend on both intended and realised routes, they are difficult to calculate, as opposed to vehicle delays which can be derived directly from the widely available Automated Vehicle Location (AVL) data of the public transport system. In this study we use three months of such historical AVL data to calculate corresponding realised routes and passengers delays in a large-scale, multi-modal transport network by formulating and implementing an adaptive passenger path choice model in an agent-based scenario of Metropolitan Copenhagen with 801,719 daily trips. The proposed model allows analysing five different levels of real-time information provision, ranging from no information at all to global real-time information being available everywhere. The results of more than 258 million (positive or negative) passenger delays show that variability of passengers’ travel time is considerable and much larger than that of the public transport vehicles. It is also shown that obtaining global real-time information at the beginning of the trip reduces passengers delay dramatically, although still being inferior to receiving such along the trip. Additionally, being able to automatically obtain real-time passenger information while walking and being on-board public transport services is found not to lead to considerable improvements compared to acquiring such information manually while waiting at stops, although slight benefits are demonstrated in supplementary models run with pseudo-intelligent vehicle delay forecasting.",0965-8564,Not found
New car taxation and its unintended environmental consequences,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.026,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"In Italy, in 2011, the Superbollo tax was introduced for newly registered cars exceeding 225 kW (later reduced to 185 kW).

Using data related to vehicles registered between 2008 and 2017 and a difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity design (RDD) framework, we find that the Superbollo had an important role in reducing CO2 emissions and in increasing the share of cars with low CO2 emissions. In particular, we show that the introduction of the Superbollo has shifted consumers towards greener, though not necessarily less energy-intensive cars (e.g., battery electric cars), resulting in a reduction of CO2 emissions per kilometre driven by newly registered cars with engine power between 150 and 200 kW by an order of magnitude of 5–8% and a reduction of kW by 1–4%.",0965-8564,Not found
Geo-fenced parking spaces identification for free-floating bicycle sharing system,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.007,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Inconsiderate parking of free-floating bicycle sharing (FFBS) can lead to conflict between FFBS companies (due to their need for a viable business model) and the local government (due to concern on the negative public image made towards the city’s landscape). This is despite the importance of FFBS in providing a reliable first and last mile connection service. The provision of geo-fenced parking spaces, along with enforcement, is the most direct approach to deal with inconsiderate parking and has been adopted by government agencies. However, such parking spaces need to be designed properly to prevent a mismatch between parking location and capacity, and the true parking demand. In this paper, we proposed an easy-to-implement procedure, which integrates the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) method and the k-means clustering algorithm in identifying potential bicycle parking facility locations and capacities. Using the FFBS operations in Xiamen, China as a case study, real-time static bicycle location data were collected over regular time intervals throughout a 21-day period to calibrate and validate the hybrid-clustering model. Comparison between model results and existing bicycle parking lots showed that the parking lots determined by our hybrid-clustering model is more effective in terms of bicycle coverage than current practices. The selection of model parameters depends on the desired level of service and the designed available parking space per parking location. The influence of data scanning frequency on the results is studied and it is found that parking deployments model results are stable so long as the data scanning frequency is larger than 6 times per day. The proposed approach in this study will be valuable to the decision-makers as well as related shared mobility operators to determine the bicycle parking location and parking lot size at a strategic planning level.",0965-8564,Not found

Using Wave 1 of an ongoing data collection effort done at the height of the restrictions in March and April 2020 in Australia, we develop a number of days WFH ordered logit model and link it to a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model for the number of weekly one-way commuting trips by car and public transport. Scenario analysis is undertaken to highlight the way in which WFH might change the amount of commuting activity when restrictions are relaxed to enable changing patterns of WFH and commuting.

Policy implications of standalone timing versus holistic timing of infrastructure interventions: Findings based on pavement surface roughness,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.021,148,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Transportation agencies routinely make repair decisions in numerous contexts which include the timing of different repair treatments over an extended period. The timing policy may be characterized either by a standalone manner that maximizes the outcome or utility of individual treatments at a given time, or by a holistic manner that maximizes the utility of all treatments together within a given horizon period. This study begins with a hypothesis that the effect of the sum of treatment prescriptions may be different from the sum of the effect of individual treatment prescriptions. The paper discusses separate practical applications where each of these two situations is pertinent. The study is based on the use of surface roughness as the indicator of pavement performance, and therefore, the framework includes the development of treatment-specific treatment performance jump and performance loss models in terms of roughness. The framework also includes identification of the optimal roughness thresholds for each pavement treatment as a standalone activity, followed by a determination of the thresholds for each treatment from a holistic standpoint. The latter involves the establishment of an optimal repair schedule over the pavement life cycle and recording the resulting roughness thresholds at which each treatment is recommended for application within the optimal schedule. Then the paper presents a case study to demonstrate application of the framework, and to compare the optimal-schedule thresholds versus the stand-alone thresholds. The case study involved fourteen treatment types, two surface material types (rigid and flexible) and three road functional classes. The results suggest that in this context of highway management, the optimal triggers associated with individual standalone repair treatments are not necessarily the same (and yield inferior outcomes) compared to the application thresholds of those treatments when they are considered within an optimized life-cycle schedule. The results can provide guidance to agencies as they examine or update their current roughness thresholds for each standard treatment and their long-term condition-based or time-based repair schedules. The paper’s framework and results can also help agencies assess the consequences of deviations from a repair timing policy (delayed or hastened applications) due to lack of funds and other causes.",0965-8564,Not found

The results show that built environment variables in residential areas have saliently non-linear associations with transit commuting, and the associations vary across traffic analysis zones.

CPT is utilized to depict travelers’ evaluations of each attribute, and MADM describes the process of making tradeoffs among multiple conflicting criteria.

The proposed approach is utilized for an empirical analysis concerning mode shift behavior for commuting in Shanghai of China, based on data collected by stated preference surveys. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods in terms of model performances and behavioral revelations. Empirical results demonstrate that sensitivity to gains and losses in cost and travel time are divergent in mode shift behavior. More importantly, it is found that travelers underestimate the occurrence chances of low-probability travel time and overestimate the occurrence changes of high-probability travel time in mode shift behavior, which is contrary to the findings from economics. Travelers show substantial loss aversion features as well. The heterogeneity in the value functions of CPT is investigated to shed light on differences in the evaluation process among individuals. Results reveal quite different empirical CPT parameters and behavioral mechanisms in mode shift behavior as compared to monetary experiments in economics.

Results reveal that low agreement between the two measures of built environment and that the perceived measure is more likely to be directly associated with DBS–metro integration than the objective measure. Different built environment attributes may affect DBS–metro integration by unique paths. Moreover, individual characteristics (i.e., gender, age, and income) and location factor moderate the association between the built environment and DBS–metro integration. Particularly, built environment attributes related to transportation service are easier to be moderated than land use and cycling condition attributes.

Examples of sectors affected by Baumol’s disease include the performing arts, health, education and some public services. Some recent literature for developed countries suggests that public transport is also affected by the cost disease. In this article we present similar evidence suggesting that Baumol’s cost disease might be present in transit services in several cities from four Latin American countries, with consequences in terms of costs and productivity that are probably made worse by rising urban congestion. We also analyze to what extent technical progress and gains in aggregate efficiency can offset the consequences of Baumol’s cost disease.

The results show that the fare-free subway policy for older adults increases the number of subway trips, which partly replaces trips by other transportation modes. Specifically, a discrete jump in the number of subway trips at age 65 replaces some auto trips and contributes to a significant reduction in household vehicle ownership. However, eligibility for the subway fare exemption has no statistically significant effects on outcomes related to social/leisure trips, although it does have varying impact on active travel by the level of household income. In addition to offering valuable lessons for cities with a similar policy, the findings of this study inform current debates on the fare-free subway policy in South Korea.",0965-8564,Not found
The optimal icebreaking tariffs and the economic performance of tramp shipping on the Northern Sea Route,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.017,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"In comparing the costs between the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and the Suez Canal Route (SCR), the NSR icebreaking tariffs are critical. A balance question of pricing rises: to cut the tariffs to attract more ship operators to use the NSR, or to increase the tariffs to cover the cost of the icebreaker fleet? However, currently active NSR icebreaking tariffs are in ceiling level, and the practical icebreaking fee is often negotiated and lacks transparency. This study explores the optimal NSR icebreaking tariff level from the price maker side for the transit tramp shipping on the NSR. The interlock of the exchange rate of Russian ruble per US dollar and the bunker price is also considered. By establishing a framework with four components and applying real data to implement the empirical study, we find that the optimal NSR icebreaking tariff level is 15% higher than the current ceiling level. At the optimal tariff level, the NSR can save 4.5–12.4% of the annual shipping cost from the SCR, whereas in a single voyage can save as high as 49.4%.",0965-8564,Not found
MaaS bundle design and implementation: Lessons from the Sydney MaaS trial,10.1016/j.tra.2021.05.010,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"A central feature of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is the design of subscription plans, also known as mobility bundles. Despite the recognition of the importance of MaaS bundles compared to the Pay as you Go (PAYG) option, there is very little guidance in the literature on what a bundle that is attractive for users and financially viable for the operator might look like. With very few actual MaaS offers in real markets, and a lack of transparency in sharing how successful the few MaaS offers have been, the call for trials has grown throughout the world. The Sydney MaaS trial is the first in Australia to introduce MaaS bundles, using an incremental strategy of adding a bundle each month after a PAYG familiarity period. This paper sets out a framework within which we designed and introduced five bundles, using a co-creation and data-driven approach to bundle design. We present the findings on how successful bundles were in attracting MaaS users away from PAYG, and what this uptake might mean for achieving goals such as reduced transport emissions, notably those associated with private car use.",0965-8564,Not found
High-speed rail and industrial developments: Evidence from house prices and city-level GDP in China,10.1016/j.tra.2021.05.001,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"With unique datasets, this paper studies the distributional impact of high-speed rail (HSR) on industrial developments by examining the house price premium of industrial parks in two important core-periphery city pairs of China: Shanghai-Suzhou and Beijing-Langfang. We find that in core cities, the premium of service industrial parks (SIPs) has grown faster near HSR stations, while that of manufacturing industrial parks (MIPs) has grown slower near HSR stations. In periphery cities, however, the premium of SIPs has grown slower near HSR stations. Moreover, the premium of MIPs has grown faster near HSR stations of Suzhou. The results suggest that HSR facilitates a “spillover effect” between the core and peripheries for the manufacturing industry, but a “siphon effect” for the service industry. City-level GDP analysis for the two industries delivers consistent results. Our findings shed light on the underlying reason for the spatial variation in the economic impacts of HSR.",0965-8564,Not found
Modelling the impact of cycle superhighways and electric bicycles,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.015,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"The share of electric bicycles is increasing. This change implies a series of outcomes, which are not understood today. Firstly, it increases travel speed for bicycles. This leads to additional consumer surplus benefits that depend on the share of electric bicycles. Secondly, it affects how infrastructure should be designed to accommodate faster bikes and avoid accidents. Thirdly, since electric bicycles can travel longer distances, they represent an alternative mode of transport for a wider range of trips. Hence, it is expected that the substitution of bicycle trips for car and public transport trips will increase. These implications have motivated the development of a large-scale econometric model where a combination of infrastructure scenarios and different bicycle types can be studied. This involves the modelling of mode and destination choice in combination with a route choice model for bicycles that accounts for differences in speed profiles across the types of bicycles and infrastructure. The main finding of this study is that the impact and importance of a bicycle network cannot be considered without, at the same time, considering the changes in the composition of bicycle types. Not accounting for the increasing share of electric bicycles will underestimate the direct travel time benefits by as much as 25% in the most extreme cases. It is also found that the introduction of more cycle superhighways in combination with increasing shares of electric bicycles caused more substitution of car trips for bicycle trips. In the extreme case, the share of bicycle trips increases to as much as 7.4%, where approximately 40% of the new bicycle trips came from substituted car drivers. The spatial distribution of benefits between different infrastructure scenarios were also investigated. The result suggests that even minor expansions of existing infrastructure can have significant effects, if these expansions are carried out at locations that increase the network connectivity.",0965-8564,Not found
A policy-based solution for the detection of colluding GPS-Spoofing attacks in FANETs,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.022,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Most of Flying Adhoc Networks (FANETs) applications consume GPS based location information for their services, which are also shared in real-time with other UAVs, ground control stations and centralized service operators. GPS spoofing is among the most popular attacks in FANETs that lead the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers to generate false navigation solutions. Several anti-spoofing techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, Conventional detection methods present vulnerabilities against Colluding GPS Spoofing Attack where multiple GPS spoofing signal sources are used. In this paper, we propose a policy-based distributed detection mechanism to face colluding GPS-Spoofing attack in FANETs. Based on Burglary scene and the location of each UAV at the time of the attack, we can distinguish between Active and Passive witnesses that are respectively used to help the target to detect and confirm the presence of GPS spoofing signal using respectively Absolute power and Carrier-to-Noise density ratio. A trust model based on Beta and Weibull Distribution has been adopted as a combination technique of different testimonies to both mitigate the spread of false rumors and classify the different signals. Simulation results depict that our proposal is able to detect and revoke the GPS Spoofing signal with high accuracy reaching the 99% and low communication overhead.",0965-8564,Not found
User acceptance of electric car-sharing services: The case of the Netherlands,10.1016/j.tra.2021.05.006,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"To reduce the externalities associated with the excessive use of carbon-fueled private vehicles, transport authorities and operators have recently been promoting one-way electric car-sharing services (ECS). Several studies attempted to identify the user acceptance and profiles of various car-sharing services, but there is a lack of consistent evidence of the psychological drivers of user acceptance. Based on an extension of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), this paper investigates the effects of six psychological constructs on behavioral intention to use ECS. Results from applying structural equation modeling to a survey with 656 respondents in the Netherlands show that social influence represents the most important driver of behavioral intention, followed by performance expectancy and personal attitude. It is also found that high satisfaction with the current means of transport for urban trips contributes to building trust in ECS companies, while car ownership has a negative indirect effect on behavioral intention. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of hygienization measures on behavioral intention is considered. The result shows that respondents have a high degree of trust in ECS operators complying with cleaning requirements, which is translated into a lower degree of anxiety and consequently higher behavioral intention.",0965-8564,Not found
"Supplementing transportation data sources with targeted marketing data: Applications, integration, and internal validation",10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.021,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Unlike many third-party data sources, targeted marketing (TM) data constitute holistic datasets, with disaggregate variables – ranging from socioeconomic and demographic characteristics to attitudes, propensities, and behaviors – available for most individuals in the population. These qualities, along with ease of accessibility and relatively low acquisition costs, make TM data an attractive source for the supplementation of traditional transportation survey data, which are facing growing threats to quality. This paper develops a typology demonstrating ways in which TM data can aid in the design of transport studies, as well as in the augmentation of modeling efforts and policy scenarios, allowing for improved understanding and forecasting of travel-related attributes. However, challenges associated with integrating, validating, and understanding TM variables have resulted in only a few transportation studies that have used these data thus far. In this paper, we provide a transportation discipline-specific resource for TM data, informed by our integration of an extensive TM database with both the National Household Travel Survey (Georgia subset) and a statewide travel behavior survey conducted in Georgia on behalf of the Georgia Department of Transportation. Using the resultant datasets, we validate TM data by means of several approaches, and find that the TM dataset reports gender, age, tenure, race, marital status, and household size with match rates ranging from 70% to 90% relative to both transportation surveys. However, we also identify biases in favor of population segments that may have more longstanding financial/transactional records (e.g., males, homeowners, non-minorities, and older individuals), biases comparable but not identical to those of survey data. While this work suggests wide-ranging implications for the use of TM data in transportation, we caution that flexible and responsible approaches to using these data are critical for staying abreast of evolving privacy regulations that govern third-party data sources such as these.",0965-8564,Not found

Yet, designing such services involves an array of challenges: from demand data acquisition and processing, to building a versatile simulation framework, to finally evaluating a variety of service configurations and making recommendations. This article illustrates the process of designing and analyzing various types of on-demand mobility services using the City of Chicago, Illinois, as a test case. We start by surveying and categorizing a large number of articles on simulation-based design of on-demand mobility services. This is followed by an extensive experimental study, which analyzes how different service designs perform under real transportation demand patterns in terms of key performance indicators such as demand acceptance rate, excess ride time, deviation from the desired pickup time, vehicle occupancy, and various fleet efficiency metrics. This type of analysis helps mobility service providers and public transit authorities gain insights into the interplay of the different passenger- and fleet-related key performance indicators. Finally, we introduce the fundamental ridesharing diagram, which quantifies the relationship between passenger convenience and fleet efficiency, and helps identify socially optimal service designs.",0965-8564,Not found
Multiple discrete-continuous choice models with bounds on consumptions,10.1016/j.tra.2021.03.016,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"This paper derives a multiple discrete–continuous (MDC) choice model formulation with constraints that specify upper bounds on consumption. To do so, considering the conventional utility maximization problem of a consumer, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are laid out for the MDC model with a general set of linear constraints that include inequalities. Subsequently, we derive a model with constraints that accommodate upper bounds on consumptions and an additive utility structure that accommodates lower bounds on consumptions. The likelihood expression for the proposed model takes a closed form. Furthermore, we extend the formulation to impose bounds on an MDC choice model with activity episode-level choice alternatives that accommodates a logical ordering among different episodes of an activity. The proposed models are derived for two different specifications of the outside good utility – (1) nonlinear utility with respect to consumption and (2) linear utility with respect to consumption. The proposed models are applied to an empirical context to analyze activity-level as well as episode-level activity participation and time allocation while considering bounds on time allocations. Empirical results suggest that the models that consider upper bounds on consumption offer a better fit to data, avoid predictions of unrealistically large time allocations, and result in overall better predictions than those from models without bounds. The proposed models are useful in situations, such as microsimulation models of travel demand, where it is crucial to avoid unrealistically large predictions.",0965-8564,Not found
Optimizing underground shelter location and mass pedestrian evacuation in urban community areas: A case study of Shanghai,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.009,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"In recent years, natural disasters happening over the world pose severe challenges to emergency evacuation systems, especially for highly-populated urban community areas. Underground spaces not systematically utilized yet provide a new development direction for the construction of emergency shelters. Emergency response for mitigating negative impacts of disasters calls for well-designed shelter system and effective management of pedestrian evacuation. In this paper, we study the location selection of underground emergency shelters in urban community areas, along with pedestrian evacuation planning once disaster happens. The aim is to effectively use the existing underground space and sidewalk network to satisfy pedestrian evacuation demand as much as possible. We formulate the problem as a network flow model, and develop a minimum-cost-maximum-flow solution approach. A real-world case study based on the East Nanjing Road community area in central Shanghai is conducted. The results show that sidewalks are the bottleneck of the pedestrian evacuation network due to their limited capacity. Reserving vehicle lanes, implementing one-way evacuation, and opening local small-scale underground shelters, are shown to be effective measures for improving the pedestrian evacuation performance. Overall, the proposed methodology and managerial insights based on the case study in Shanghai show a great potential of employing underground space as shelters for pedestrian evacuation system design in urban community areas.",0965-8564,Not found
Testing alternative treatments for underused carpool lanes on narrow freeways,10.1016/j.tra.2021.05.002,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Carpool lanes that are not filled to capacity can spell trouble, particularly when deployed on narrow freeways with only 3 lanes in each travel direction. Two alternative treatments for underused carpool lanes were evaluated with this in mind. Both can boost discharge flows by opening a portion of the carpool lane to all freeway traffic in the vicinity of a bottleneck. The simpler of the two alternatives opens the lane segment on a permanent basis. The other does so intermittently. Both alternatives leave the carpool lane intact on segments well upstream of an active bottleneck. Carpools are thus still enabled to bypass slower-moving queues in a freeway’s regular-use lanes. Both alternatives have previously been proposed, but were yet to be tested. The present tests entail simulations of a real 3-lane freeway. The simulation model was calibrated to roughly match unfavorable conditions presently triggered by the site’s underused carpool lane. Experiments were thereafter performed by varying travel demands parametrically. These tests unveiled why the alternatives are likely to be better options than rescinding the site’s carpool restriction and opening the full length of the lane to all traffic. Simulations also show that, unless the carpool lane is nearly filled to capacity, the alternatives perform better than does the traditional practice of running the lane through a bottleneck. The simpler of the two alternatives performed well when the carpool lane operated at less than two-thirds its capacity. The intermittent treatment was found superior when carpool demands were higher. The savings in Vehicle Hours Traveled (VHT) and People Hours Traveled (PHT) generated by the alternatives were often large. Deploying the simpler alternative under the site’s present-day conditions, for example, was found to reduce PHT and VHT by more than 1,000 (hours) each, over a 5-h period spanning the afternoon rush. These improvements did not come at great cost to carpools. To the contrary, carpools often benefited from the alternative treatments, despite having at times to traverse the site’s bottleneck sans priority. This is because by diminishing regular-lane queues, the alternatives also diminished the deleterious friction effect on carpool-lane speeds. Policy implications for carpool- and other kinds of special-use lanes are discussed.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of large-scale events: A difference-in-difference model for a Pokémon go safari zone event in Tainan and its effect on bikeshare systems,10.1016/j.tra.2021.05.005,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Large-scale events bring tourists to host cities and increase the density of people circulating therein. Pokémon Go Safari Zone events have been hugely successful at attracting tourists to cities around the world. For example, in one five-day Pokémon event in Tainan, Taiwan in 2018, the daily log-in count was 250,000 per day on average, generating an estimated US$50 million in revenue for the city. In order to better understand the impacts of Pokémon and other similar events on bikeshare systems, this study examined changes in station-based bikeshare trips before and during one case study event. We divided bikeshare trips into event-related (i.e., treatment) and event-unrelated (i.e., control) groups based on whether the trips originated from rental stations near 30 scenic event-related locations. We also evaluated the event’s impact on the number of trips and trip durations for different smartcard users. A difference-in-difference method was used for the analysis. The results show that this event increased bikeshare trips by 27% for trips starting from event-related rental stations. The number of riders making payment by EasyCard (a smartcard first used by Taipei Mass Rapid Transit) also increased. However, there was no significant change in the duration of bicycle rentals between different smartcard types. Understanding how this event and the associated bikeshare systems are interrelated will be helpful for city administrators seeking to provide adequate services for such events in the future.",0965-8564,Not found

What determines the acceptance of socially optimal traffic coordination?: A scenario-based examination in Germany,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.004,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"Social optimization emerged as a strategy for the attainment of more efficient road traffic (i.e., minimal total or average travel time). In order to achieve efficiency benefits, collective action is needed. A major challenge is that not every individual benefits equally from social optimization. Thus, a corresponding technological implementation (i.e., a social optimizing traveler information system (SOTIS)) is prone to rejection. The question remains as to which factors underlie the acceptance of such a system. Therefore a sample of 391 car drivers in Germany, stratified by kilometers driven per year, age and gender, completed a scenario-based questionnaire addressing attitudinal acceptance of a SOTIS. The results indicate that participants reacted rather hesitantly towards incorporating a SOTIS into daily driving. Indeed, structural equation modeling revealed that the behavioral intention to use it was promoted by its perceived usefulness. However, this intention was negatively affected by elicited subjective ambivalence (i.e., simultaneous conducive and opposing affect towards the SOTIS). Opposition in subjective ambivalence could be explained by perceived injustice. Social factors (i.e., a social norm and image gains due to using the system) were positively associated with perceived usefulness. The high social dependency and the effect for perceived injustice were not replicated in a second sample of 111 drivers that evaluated a user-optimizing traveler information system (UOTIS). The results suggest to taking active ambivalence reduction through transparent prevention of injustice, and the promotion of a conducive social norm into account in the planning and design of a SOTIS. Additionally, this study provides an empirically tested framework for examining the emergence and maintenance of acceptance of such a system.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of using a naïve approach in the limited-stop bus service design problem,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.018,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"The proven benefits of limited-stop services have captured the attention of researchers, especially during the last decade. However, to solve the limited-stop service design problem many existing works directly impose a capacity constraint to a total social cost objective function. This “naïve approach” implicitly assumes that passengers behave altruistically, basing their decisions on what is best for the whole system. Although this issue has been identified in earlier works, the magnitude of the error induced by this simplification has not been studied yet. The objective of this work is to measure this error and to understand how it misrepresents passenger flows and bus occupation rates. To measure this error gap, we optimize a set of test scenarios by applying a naïve approach, and then take the resulting design and obtain a benchmark passenger assignment using a simple behavioral model. We propose two main indicators to compare both passenger assignment: the total passenger deviation, and the total capacity deficit. This comparison reveals that the assignment of the naïve approach may indeed be unrealistic, and raises concerns that a network design based on the naïve approach might have severe problems when implemented. Thus, the work highlights the importance of taking the results of the naïve approach with caution and verify them with a passenger assignment model before their implementation.",0965-8564,Not found
The role of coordination costs in mode choice decisions: A case study of German cities,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.001,149,2021-07-01,2021,7,"In times of accelerating urbanization and environmental pollution, mode choice decisions (MCD) are a critical parameter in a city’s appearance and its environmental impacts. Simultaneously, the emerging smartphone multimodal traveller information systems (SMTIS) simplifies the usage of multimodal trips and, therefore, enhance the options in MCD. Current MCD models, in addition to considering classic parameters like travel time and cost, also consider socioeconomic variables and latent variables, such as modal preferences or mode-specific characteristics. However, from the users’ perspective, one main influence is currently still not sufficiently considered in these models: Coordination costs for planning the trip, such as looking-up time tables for public transport. Consequently, we introduced this variable in a multinomial logit model and made a representative survey in Germany for measuring the coordination effort and evaluating our model. Our results support our hypothesis that coordination costs have a significant impact on MCD. We therefore conclude that further developments in information systems together with supporting policies may influence the MCD and, hence, lead to more sustainable cities in the future.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper presents an overview of and a modelling work on a dataset collected in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to understand consumers' willingness-to-pay for various automation levels in their vehicles simultaneously with private and shared ownership types. The study used 190 records from a reasonably representative sample collected from the study area. Heteroskedastic error-component mixed multinomial and nested logit models are formatted for different vehicle ownerships in this study. Strong inertia effect of staying with private conventional vehicles (PCVs) is identified. We also discover that private vehicle buyers will find level 4 vehicles attractive, whereas car-sharing service users will favour level 5 vehicles. For level 4 vehicles, consumers are willing to pay from CAN $ 10,800 to CAN $ 29,800, depending on the vehicle price.

Binary logistic generalised estimating equations (GEE) modelling was used for statistical analysis of the road-crossing decisions. Younger children were significantly less able to make correct and safe judgments compared with older children. Children also had considerable difficulties making safe judgments for vehicles travelling at over 30 km/h and those approaching from the offside lane. Visual distractions were also associated with significantly poorer road-crossing decisions, independent of child age and gender. Parents and educators should alert children about risky road-crossing situations and educate them accordingly.

Perceptions are also important in developing programs to promote cycling and they may even be more important for cyclists than the reality itself. In this research, we integrated the perceptions of cycling safety and theft risk into a hybrid discrete choice model in order to better understand cycling infrastructure preferences, using Bogota, a bike-friendly city with security concerns, as a case study. We found that concerns about safety are a significant deterrent to using bike lanes at the road level in the city while perceptions of theft risk affect the value or importance that bicyclists place on travel time.

A four-week taxi GPS trajectory data set is collected in the first quarter of 2020, which covers the period of lockdown and phased reopening in the city. We conduct a spatiotemporal analysis of taxi demand using the data, and then select taxis that continued to operate through the analysis period to examine whether and how they adjusted operational strategies. We find, among other things: (i) the taxi demand in Shenzhen shrank more than 85% in the lockdown phase and barely recovered from that bottom even after the city began to reopen; (ii) the recovery of taxi travel fell far behind that of the overall vehicle travel in the city; (iii) most taxis significantly cut back work hours in response to the lockdown, and many adjusted work schedule to focus on serving peak-time demand after it was lifted; (iv) taxi drivers demonstrate distinct behavioral adaptations to the pandemic that can be identified by a clustering analysis; and (v) while the level of taxi service dropped precipitately at the beginning, it quickly rebounded to exceed the pre-pandemic level, thanks to the government’s incentive policy. These empirical findings suggest (i) incentives aiming at boosting supply should more precisely target where the boost is most needed; (ii) the taxi market conditions should be closely monitored to support and adjust policies; and (iii) when the demand is severely depressed by lockdown orders or when the market is oversupplied, taxi drivers should be encouraged and aided to use more centralized dispatching modes.",0965-8564,Not found
Forecasting with a joint mode/time-of-day choice model based on combined RP and SC data,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.006,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The factors influencing trip departure time are taking more importance in urban planning practice since congestion is increasingly being addressed by travel demand management (TDM) strategies. In this paper we formulate and estimate a joint travel mode-departure time model for commuting trips using combined revealed preference (RP) and stated choice (SC) data. The RP data considered nine alternative modes and up to 11 time periods, and the level-of-service data were obtained at an unusual level of precision using GPS measurements. The travel time, cost and cost divided by the wage rate coefficients were fairly similar in both the RP and SC environments, suggesting equal error variances for both datasets. The only parameters that differed between each type of data were those associated with the schedule delay early (SDE) and late (SDL) variables required by Small’s Scheduling Model. This may be due to the potentially different temporal perspectives between RP choices (longer term decisions) and SC decisions, arguably shorter term given the nature of the experiment and the context presented in it (implementation of a congestion charging policy and a flexible working-hours scheme). The models were used to forecast the impacts of a hypothetic congestion charging scheme in Santiago, showing that the schedule delay coefficients derived from the SC context produced a smoother and less-peaked temporal distribution of travel demand than the RP parameters.",0965-8564,Not found

Emerging research has aimed to understand the hierarchical structure of ride-hailing service quality (including booking app and post-booking service). Therefore, this study proposes a formative hierarchical component model of perceived booking app quality consisting of seven dimensions (i.e., privacy and security, ease of use, functionality, design, information accuracy, route detection, and service). Likewise, the perceived post-booking service quality is comprised of four dimensions (i.e., reliability, personal, convenience, and tangibility). Data used for testing the model was collected from 536 ride-hailing service users in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. The results provide insights into attributes forming perceived quality of ride-hailing booking apps and perceived post-booking service quality and how these constructs affect passenger loyalty. The results are also useful for ride-hailing companies in their efforts to prioritise critical service attributes and ensure their service quality meets or exceeds passengers’ expectations.",0965-8564,Not found
Will It Fly? Adoption of the road pricing framework to manage drone use of airspace,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.001,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Applications and demand for airborne drone operations, including urban air mobility, are growing rapidly in regional and metropolitan areas. However, the expected traffic volumes in cities will make it impossible to operate drones in uncontrolled airspace. Despite the wealth of literature on pricing transport infrastructure usage showing that variable pricing is the optimal way for charging for road use, jurisdictions are reluctant to move towards this efficient mechanism evident in the slow uptake of road pricing implementation globally. What is worse, regulations have been drafted to tax the drone growth similarly to cars proposing the adoption of annual registration fees for drones. This paper proposes that drone use should instead adopt a pricing structure modelled on road user charging, and presents evidence suggesting that a case can be made for enabling controlled and fair growth through low altitude airspace management (LAAM) systems and variable drone user charges. A stated preference experiment with 825 respondents who actively fly drones has shown user charge potential in way of willingness to pay (WTP) of A$0.11 for flying a drone for one hour. Random parameters logit models further allowed us to establish much higher WTP for various currently not permitted activities such as A$7.09 to fly beyond line of flight or A$4.29 to fly outside daylight hours. As such, if those occasional uses are variably charged, we argue that a commercially viable LAAM system could be implemented, and low altitude air traffic user charging could overtake implementation of the wider (i.e. road) transport capacity pricing on the fast lane.",0965-8564,Not found
Impacts of COVID-19 on the usage of public bicycle share in London,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.010,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to the adoption of many unprecedented measures to slow down the spread of the virus. Such measures have greatly impacted the entire transportation system and individuals’ travel behaviors. This paper evaluates the impacts of COVID-19 related policies, including the lockdown and the first lockdown ease on the usage of public bicycle share in London using interrupted time series approach. Our results indicate that the UK’s lockdown led to an immediate decrease in the London Cycle Hire (LCH) usage, while the first lockdown ease had no statistically significant immediate impacts. Moreover, during the lockdown period, the LCH usage showed an increasing trend and the first lockdown ease led to a much larger increase rate. Such impacts vary by the trip characteristics (i.e., occurring period and trip duration). The morning peak trips and short duration trips maintained a lower usage level during the lockdown and the lockdown ease period. On the contrary, the number of other LCH trips were much larger than that in normal days. Furthermore, the impacts on the LCH stations near the rail stations, hospitals, and parks also varied differently. The LCH trips near the rail stations reduced more after the imposition of the lockdown policy while those near the hospitals reduced less. The LCH stations near the parks had a much higher increase rate during the lockdown and the lockdown ease period than the general level. Our results provide practical implications for the policy makers and operators of the public bicycle share system.",0965-8564,Not found
BRT fare elasticities from smartcard data: Spatial and time-of-the-day differences,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.018,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The changes in public transport ridership can be quantified as fare elasticities that are useful inputs to inform planning and policymaking, particularly for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems in developing city contexts. This research provides new evidence to the limited literature in the Global South about revealed preferences fare elasticity from disaggregated data and improves our knowledge of BRT passengers’ travel behavior providing insights on the important role of achieving an affordable fare. Using a 9-year smartcard data, we show that in a spatially segregated city, such as Bogotá, the BRT fare has differential effects according to the socio-economic characteristics of its users and the time-of-the-day. To estimate the fare elasticity considering the socio-economic heterogeneity of users, we proposed a clustering algorithm based on the station-demand profiles and an indicative average per capita income associated with the station catchment area. The results show significant statistical differences in elasticities between the three identified clusters. The stations located in the urban periphery, associated with low-income areas, show null or low response to the fare changes, as opposed to the stations located on the east edge of the city (wealthiest zones). These findings show that a flat fare in the BRT system has differential fare effects on users, therefore, considering those differences when designing the fare policy scheme would contribute to starting to close accessibility gaps in the city.",0965-8564,Not found
Economic and socioeconomic assessment of replacing conventional public transit with demand responsive transit services in low-to-medium density areas,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.008,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The emergence of demand responsive transport (DRT) services is restructuring mobility in the urban universe. They provide a high level of service and in many cases compete with public transportation modes. However, in less dense areas, where conventional public transit (CPT) services such as buses are inefficient and costly, DRT services could be an alternative that is both profitable and provides passenger satisfaction. This paper investigates the economic and socioeconomic potential of replacing CPT with DRT services. In particular, it focuses on the development and combination of two models. The first is an agent-based model, which describes movements of vehicles and assigns them to passengers according to a utility function. The assignment equilibrium problem is solved for demand that is elastic to generalized cost alone. The second is an economic optimization model, based on a simulated annealing algorithm, which aims to determine supply conditions that maximize the benefit for the operator, the user, the environment, and society. Four economic problems are discussed and formulated accordingly. In addition, supply optimization is carried out in particular with respect to fleet size, trip fare, and vehicle capacity. Finally, these models are applied to a real case in the Paris metropolitan area where a bus service has been replaced by a DRT system. The results show that though this shift is not beneficial from a societal point of view, bus demand is attracted by a DRT service consisting of 30 vehicles and charging a fare of €0.5. The operator would aim to propose a taxi-service, with small-sized vehicles and higher fares, in order to increase their profitability. User utility, on the other hand, would suggest that public authorities should regulate fares and vehicle capacity (more than 6 seats). Fare regulation, in particular, will depend on the fleet size, ranging linearly from €0 for 25 vehicles to €4 for 70 vehicles. Finally, we find through the sensitivity analysis that thresholds exist for demand and fixed costs (respectively 85% and 90% of reference values) beyond which the bus line is more beneficial to society than the DRT service.",0965-8564,Not found
Modeling regional disparity and the reverse commute,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.005,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"This paper measures a) whether the reverse commute – a commute where a worker travels from a home location in the city to a workplace location in the suburbs – is characterized by a uniquely disparate socioeconomic and demographic space between home and workplace, and b) what role greater fragmentation between municipalities in a region might play in this theoretically inequitable circumstance. We employ administrative origin–destination data from the metropolitan Philadelphia, PA area and contemporary dimension reduction methodologies to model the likelihood of an origin destination pair being classified as a reverse commute. Particular attention is given to interactions between socioeconomic and metropolitan fragmentation terms and non-linear specifications of predictor variables. Greater socioeconomic and demographic disparity between home and work geographies is found to uniquely predict the reverse commute. We also find that fragmentation at the metropolitan scale has a multidimensional impact in relation to this socio-economic difference. Together, our findings appear to signal that, while greater regional socioeconomic disparity does indeed correlate with the reverse commute, greater metropolitan fragmentation may not. This portrait highlights new areas for transport research around political fragmentation and makes the case for renewed, equity-oriented policy investment in the reverse commuting problem.",0965-8564,Not found

Autonomous vehicles and mobility for people with special needs,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.014,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Large mobility gaps exist between people with and without disabilities. People with special needs are heavily dependent upon public transportation for their essential needs. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to increase mobility for these populations. However, they have been largely absent from AV perception research. To fill this gap, we analyzed their perceptions, willingness to use, and concerns over autonomous public transit (APT) based on an on-board intercept survey of 1861 current bus riders in Michigan, with 40% having some type of special needs. We found significant differences among different special needs groups. While respondents who were visually impaired, mobility restricted, or with multiple accommodation needs were more likely to rely on public transit than those without any special needs, their willingness to use APT varied. Respondents with visual impairment were more likely, but riders with mobility disabilities were less likely to be willing to use APT. In addition, our survey results suggest that respondents with special needs perceive AVs primarily negatively. This was especially true for mobility-restricted groups. Furthermore, there were differences in bus riders’ reasons not to use APT. Compared to respondents without special needs, those with multiple accommodation needs hold concerns over APT’s safety more, while respondents with mobility disabilities were more likely to distrust AV technology. This study advances our understanding of different special needs populations’ perception and acceptance of APT, providing support to policymakers in developing inclusive policies and practices that would bring the promised benefits of AVs to these populations.",0965-8564,Not found
An improved potential-based approach to measuring the daily accessibility of HSR,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.009,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"With the rapid development of high-speed rail (HSR) systems in China, the evaluation of the accessibility of HSR has become an important issue, especially for daily accessibility, or daytime round-trip travel (one-way journeys taking within 4 h), as this form of travel has significantly redefined the concept of the business trips are. This paper presents an improved approach to measuring potential-based accessibility by adding train frequency as an important weight and distinguishing the travel time into different intervals to measure accessibility. With a case study of Shandong Province, China, the paper verifies that the improved approach is more suitable for evaluating the daily accessibility and more practical for regional and transport planning than the original approach. First, the method is more effective in analyzing the differences in accessibility between cities and revealing more detailed changes or improvements in accessibility resulting from HSR. Second, there is a stronger correlation between the accessibility of different time intervals and the local economic level (GDP). Third, the method is more in line with the actual conditions in explaining the improved accessibility and corresponding spatial structures of a region. As a result, the improved approach provides an improved ability to better characterize the impacts of accessibility on regional development and will play an important role in regional planning and transportation planning. Finally, the paper also notes that the proposed approach is primarily suited for the middle-or macrolevel accessibility studies.",0965-8564,Not found

The introduction of Urban Vehicle Access Regulations such as Low Emission Zones represents one policy that is being actively considered in city governance to address this problem, whereby the access of highly polluting vehicles is restricted to reduce traffic-related emissions. For such a policy to be implemented, an understanding of public support can prove useful by identifying the issues that underpin citizen reaction. This paper presents an assessment of public acceptability to Low Emission Zones through the application of a conceptual framework. This framework integrates an array of socio-psychological constructs sourced from theoretical models of behaviour and empirical findings on acceptability to Transport Demand Management measures. The framework is applied through a Structural Equation Model with the results of the analysis indicating that attitudes, policy specific beliefs, trust in government, and problem awareness all represent significant constructs in terms of their direct and in-direct effects on acceptability.

In the context of tourism, MaaS could improve transportation sustainability by providing integrated information about sustainable transportation modes. To develop a systematic understanding of tourists’ preference for tour mode bundle, we design a tour-based stated preference (SP) choice experiment based on bundle configuration of travel modes in MaaS including a shared van as a paratransit mode in combination with the existing bus and taxi services. A web-based SP survey is conducted for 331 individuals who visited Jeju Island in Korea. Two mixed logit models are estimated to reveal differences between the trip- and tour-based mode choice situations. The estimation results reveal that the trip sequence significantly influences the preference for travel mode in a tour mode bundle, which has significant cross effects with individual and travel context attributes. A shared van is the most preferred in both a trip and a tour. Persistence to using the same mode and synergy of using different modes are captured through significant cross effects of sequence-specific travel modes in a tour mode bundle.

Assessing one-way carsharing's impacts on vehicle ownership: Evidence from Shanghai with an international comparison,10.1016/j.tra.2021.05.012,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Carsharing is considered an important alternative to the private car. Based on the studies in Europe and North America, it is agreed that carsharing can reduce private car ownership. However, due to the differences in the development stages and characteristics of cities and transportation, it is unknown whether carsharing can also decrease car ownership in China, which results in a gap in the evaluation of carsharing in China. This paper takes the carsharing project EVCARD in Shanghai as an example. Based on survey data on vehicle ownership from users and actual operations data, the impacts of carsharing on selling cars, giving up and delaying purchasing a car in Shanghai are quantitatively analyzed. The results in Shanghai are compared with the relevant research results in different cities around the world. The results show that: (1) the carsharing project in Shanghai also has the benefit of reducing private car ownership. Each carsharing vehicle can replace 4.56 private cars. However, unlike in European and North American cities, Shanghai carsharing mainly suppresses vehicle growth by reducing individual willingness to buy a car, because the proportion of cars sold owing to carsharing is obviously lower than in Europe and North America. (2) For giving up car purchases, carsharing mainly suppresses the first car in the family. (3) Good public transport and carsharing services can substantially improve the substitution benefits of carsharing for private cars. If carsharing can reach the service level of “whenever and wherever carsharing is available”, the proportion of users who sell, give up and delay buying cars will increase from 0.78%, 30% and 31% to 12%, 40% and 47% respectively. The findings in the study provide a quantitative basis for assessing the carsharing benefits on the reduction of vehicle ownership in China, and also provide a useful reference for evaluating carsharing benefits in other developing countries.",0965-8564,Not found
Assessing the operational impact of tactical planning models for bike-sharing redistribution,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.003,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Station-based bike-sharing systems provide users with inexpensive one-way bike rides. A major challenge for operators of BSSs lies in redistributing bikes so that users may take the bike rides they request. Existing research on tactical planning proposes optimization models for designing redistribution plans that a vehicle fleet implements on a daily basis. The purpose of this paper is to identify the value and limitations of stochastic programming for bike-sharing redistribution and to understand the efficacy of the obtained plans once they are implemented. To this end, we first analyze the variability in recorded ride data from three North American bike-sharing systems which mainly differ in the intensity of commuting. The results of the data analysis show that stations that are mainly used by commuters display less variability in demand than stations that are mainly used for other ride purposes like errands and leisure. To assess the effect of demand variability on the operational implementation of redistribution plans, we rely on agent-based simulation. In the simulation, vehicle tours are implemented as planned. However, since redistribution plans are designed based on demand forecasts of ride requests, guidance is needed about how to adjust the bike quantities to pick up from or deliver to each station when actual ride requests are observed. Therefore, we propose rule-based procedures to adjust redistribution decisions when the numbers of bikes at stations and vehicle loads differ from the setting considered by optimization. We show that demand variability is a leading indicator about whether redistribution plans perform well operationally.",0965-8564,Not found
"The value of travel time savings and the value of leisure in Zurich: Estimation, decomposition and policy implications",10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.015,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"We use state-of-the art estimation approaches to obtain mode-specific values of travel time savings (VTTS) based on pooled RP/SP travel choice data of Zurich workers. Unlike the large majority of time valuation studies, we also have data on the respondents’ time-use and expenditure allocation, which enables us to estimate their value of leisure (VoL),i.e. the opportunity value of liberated time when the duration of a committed activity, such as travel, is reduced. We use the estimates of the VoL and the VTTS to derive the value of time assigned to travel (VTAT) – the monetary value of the direct (dis-)utility derived from the conditions experienced while traveling. Linking the VTTS and VoL at the individual-level allows for a detailed analysis of VTAT distributions. We obtain median VTTS for car and motorbike (MIV) of 30.6 CHF/h, carpooling (CP) of 27.7 CHF/h, carsharing (CS) of 26.7 CHF/h, walk of 26.7 CHF/h, bike of 18.2 CHF/h and public transportation (PT) of 14.8 CHF/h. The median VoL amounts to 25.2 CHF/h. We find that MIV, CS and CP perform worst in terms of VTAT (as indicated by values smaller than zero), showing that the perceived travel comfort all in car modes (private, shared and pooled) is substantially lower than for PT and bike, where the VTAT are greater than zero. From a transportation policy perspective, our results suggest that travel comfort matters greatly and investing in the quality of travel should therefore obtain more attention. However, from a PT operator’s point of view, our results indicate that in the case of Zurich, investing in faster connections may exhibit a higher marginal impact on user benefits, since the VoL is relatively high, while travel comfort is perceived as high already.",0965-8564,Not found
Effects of built environment and weather on demands for transportation network company trips,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.011,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"This paper investigates the effects of the built environment and weather on the demands for transportation network companies (TNC) in Toronto. The research is based on a historical dataset of Uber trips from September 2016 to September 2018 in Toronto. A wide range of built environments, sociodemographic, and weather data are generated at the dissemination area-level and fused with the monthly aggregated Uber dataset. To provide insight into the underlying factors that affect TNC demand, a series of aggregate demand models are estimated using log-transformed constant elasticity demand functions, with consideration of the seasonal lag effect. To capture the weather effect, an autoregressive moving average model is estimated for the downtown core of Toronto. The model results show that the influence of lagged ridership and seasonal lag effect have a positive correlation with TNC demand. The trip generation and attraction models reveal that TNC trips increase where when the commuting trip duration is longer than 60 min. It is found that the number of apartments in a dissemination area is positively correlated with TNC trip generation, while the number of single-detached houses has a negative correlation. The time-series model indicates that temperature and total daily precipitations are positively correlated with TNC demand. Due to the lack of comprehensive data sources on the Uber and Lyft ridership, the policymakers often struggle to make evidence-based policy recommendations to regulate such disruptive technologies. The series of models presented in this study will help us better understand the potential users of transportation network companies (TNC) and the effects of land use, built environment and weather on transportation network company trips.",0965-8564,Not found
Integrating transit systems with ride-sourcing services: A study on the system users’ stochastic equilibrium problem,10.1016/j.tra.2021.05.008,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Ride-sourcing services are continuously gaining popularity among urban travelers. Due to their flexibility and responsiveness, transit agencies spot chances of collaborating with Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) in order to improve service quality, promote transit usage, and meanwhile lower their operational cost. In this paper, we studied an integrated transit system where ride-sourcing services complement the transit service as an efficient and economical access mode. The users of the integrated system consist of not only transit riders but also drivers for TNCs. Riders maximize their utilities by choosing whether and how to use the integrated system, and drivers maximize their payoffs by deciding how to serve riders. More importantly, in this two-sided system, their decisions are unfolded to each other and mutually influence one another such that an equilibrium is reached where no one can improve their outcome. We modeled the stochastic mode choice of riders and zone choice of drivers and captured the interactive attributes in a fixed-point problem. The existence of such an equilibrium was proved, and an iterative solution algorithm that utilizes network algorithms was proposed to find an equilibrium pattern of the stochastic demand-supply problem. A real-world case study using the Twin Cities’ data was carried out, and insights into the mechanism of the integrated transit system were developed. Various aspects of the system including user perception, demand estimation, pricing strategy, and subsidy strategy were investigated through the proposed model.

Influences on transit ridership and transit accessibility in US urban areas,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.014,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The success of transit systems, traditionally gauged through ridership metrics, must also be assessed via transit accessibility because accessibility to destinations indicates the quality of service that transit provides. Using a structural equation modeling approach, we explain transit accessibility and transit ridership in 2017 for 50 large urbanized areas in the United States as dual outcomes dependent upon population size, urban form, and transit service provision. Also, we examine transit accessibility as a factor that influences transit ridership. We find that transit service provision strongly influences both transit ridership per capita and job accessibility provided by transit. Further, we find that transit accessibility, in turn, offers a moderate boost to transit ridership. Population density results in higher transit accessibility directly by making destinations easier to reach and indirectly by increasing the amount of transit services provided. Other built environment and transit service variables were examined but did not improve the models’ explanatory power. Disaggregating the effects of fixed-guideway (i.e., rail) and non-fixed guideway transit (i.e., buses in mixed traffic), we find that fixed-guideway transit has a more substantial effect on transit accessibility, while non-fixed guideway transit has a larger effect on transit ridership per vehicle mile.",0965-8564,Not found
Modelling individual preferences of goods receivers for a Receiver-led delivery consolidation service,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.004,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"There have been various initiatives to consolidate freight deliveries.

This study estimates behavioural responses of businesses in Melbourne’s CBD, Australia using a mixed logit model a latent-class logit mode with respect to receivers’ preferences for the RLC service as well as quantifying the willingness to pay (WTP) for a RLC delivery service. The modelling results show that the time-window of consolidated delivery and availability of relevant value-added services significantly influence receivers’ preferences. The study findings reveal high preferences for versions of a RLC service that maintain current delivery practices. The results of the WTP calculation suggest that while there might be a net benefit for receivers to pay for services, delivery characteristics of receivers, such as their sub-industry type, highly influence WTP. Future freight consolidation should be optimised by sub-industry and should accommodate as closely as possible the current delivery practices that businesses use. Accordingly, this study proposes suitable configurations of a RLC service based on the individual-level preferences of the most willing sub-industries.",0965-8564,Not found
Examining the driver-pedestrian interaction at pedestrian crossings in the connected environment: A Hazard-based duration modelling approach,10.1016/j.tra.2021.05.014,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The availability of advisory warnings via Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communication in the connected environments is expected to gradually increase over the next few years. Much of the research on advisory warning systems have examined driving behaviour in response to unexpected driving hazards; however, very little research has been conducted on common driving interactions such as interacting with pedestrians at pedestrian crossings. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the connected environment on driving behaviour at pedestrian crossings. The connected environment was designed within the CARRS-Q advanced driving simulator. A combination of auditory (beep sound) and imagery message was simultaneously displayed on the windscreen to advise the driver on the presence of a pedestrian entering from a sidewalk. Seventy-eight licensed drivers drove the simulator in two driving conditions, namely, baseline and connected environment. The participants were 18–65 years old, and a third of them were females. Drivers' response to the driving aids and the braking behaviour were analysed in the latent response phase and the observable response phase, and the corresponding response times were modelled using the hazard-based duration modelling approach. In particular, this study applied the Weibull accelerated failure time model with shared frailty accounting for multiple observations from the same driver. Results showed that the time taken to respond to the pedestrian in the latent response phase was longer when the advisory warning was provided to the drivers, but the corresponding time in the observable response phase was shorter, indicating that drivers take an informed decision in the connected environment. Moreover, the safety margin—measured in terms of time-to-collision—was higher in the connected environment than the traditional driving environment, indicating a safer behavioural adaptation towards the connected environment.",0965-8564,Not found
Shared parking acceptance under perceived network externality and risks: Theory and evidence,10.1016/j.tra.2021.05.009,150,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Despite the increasing interest in shared parking, little attention has been devoted to its perceptions and acceptance among drivers. To fill such a gap, this paper develops a novel theoretical framework in which perceived network externality, cost risk, safety risk, and management pressure are incorporated into the Combined Technology Acceptance Model and Theory of Planned Behavior (C-TAM-TPB). This paper merely focuses on positive network externality. First, a mathematical model is proposed to verify some of the hypotheses. The analytical results show that both a driver’s utility and the shared parking platform’s equilibrium demand are increasing in the effect of network externality and decreasing in the effect of risks. Second, a structural equation modeling approach with the partial least squares algorithm is employed for parameter estimation and model assessment. We conducted a quantitative study with 321 usable responses. The empirical results show that, except for management pressure, all the other constructs measured in the study had a significant total effect on user attitude and use intention towards shared parking. The corresponding amount of variance in attitude and use intention explained by our research model was 68.4% and 72.6%, respectively.

Do policy incentives drive electric vehicle adoption?

This paper focuses on the development of the EV industry in China and empirically examines the impact of the government’s incentives on EV adoption in both the public and private domains using data from 61 cities spanning 2009–2018. EV-supportive policies, including financial incentives and convenience measures, are discussed, and a variable instrumental strategy is applied to solve the endogenous problem of charging facilities. The results reveal that in the public domain, financial subsidies can effectively promote the use of electric buses; however, the adoption of commercial EVs is mainly stimulated by charging facility construction and increasing fuel prices. Meanwhile, in the private domain, convenience measures, such as charging station construction and non-purchase limitations, contribute to increasing the demand for EVs, while the effect of financial incentives is not as significant as we expected.",0965-8564,Not found
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) carsharing and driverless vehicles: Attitudes and values of vehicle owners,10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.008,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Within the growing suite of shared mobility options, peer-to-peer (P2P) carsharing provides an opportunity for vehicle owners to rent out their vehicle to other individuals through informal arrangements or more typically through a facilitating company/broker. Despite the potential to offset some of the costs of vehicle ownership and contribute more broadly to the shared economy, barriers remain including that of sharing one’s own vehicle with a stranger. Driverless vehicles (DVs) provide potential to partially address this barrier to carsharing, but it is unknown if this will be embraced by vehicle owners per se and to what extent this might be influenced by their personal characteristics and values. Within this context, the current paper evaluates the joint attitudes of 751 Australian vehicle owners towards sharing of their current vehicle and embracing DVs. Overall, while most respondents remain concerned about DV technology, they understand the benefits, expressing higher concerns about carsharing. Segmentation procedures are used to profile participants on key dimensions including their willingness-to-purchase a DV, demographics, personality and psychological constructs and contextual factors. Four classes of vehicle owners are identified with 14% being ambivalent to sharing and DVs, 14% highly concerned, 48% being ‘on the fence’ and 24% expressing positive sentiments towards these new forms of mobility. Ambivalence appears to be more pronounced with significantly older, male participants who are less agreeable and conscientious, while concern seems to be a trait of older females more adhering to security, tradition, conformity, and benevolence. Conversely, positive sentiments are associated with participants who are slightly older, male, more open-minded, while less benevolent and traditional. Findings highlight the importance of offering tailored packages of information, messages and services that appeal to the personal benefits and cost savings for some segments of the community, but which highlight the altruistic benefit of sharing for others.",0965-8564,Not found
“Satisfaction lies in the effort”. Is Gandhi's quote also true for satisfaction with commuting?,10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.010,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Research on travel satisfaction in terms of its determinants and in terms of its relationship with subjective well-being has not taken account of the effort in travelling. This paper explicitly considers the role of effort and its three constituent elements (physical, cognitive and affective) by analysing the way each interacts with travel satisfaction and subjective well-being. The context of the study is Greater Sydney, New South Wales, Australia where respondents answered an internet-based survey. The paper has two main objectives. First to explore the benefit or otherwise of including ‘effort’ in analyses of travel satisfaction: the analysis shows that including effort provides additional explanation. Second, to explore the bidirectional nature of the interaction between travel satisfaction and subjective well-being. The analysis suggests that the bottom-up approach to well-being whereby the link is from travel satisfaction to well-being is stronger. The paper concludes with some policy implications of how transport policy can reduce effort and thereby make sustainable travel more appealing.",0965-8564,Not found
Mechanisms of passing through short exits for the elderly and young adults,10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.014,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The enhancement of the passage efficiency and the safety of pedestrians in public places have being paid increasing attentions. The increase of the elderly in crowds may impact the level of service of transportation systems due to the lower physical abilities. In this work, we focus on the movement characteristics through short bottlenecks for both the elderly and young adults experimentally. It is found that the elderly adopts the distance-oriented strategy when moving forward to an exit, while the young adults adopt the time-oriented strategy. These strategies lead to a 26% decline in the space utilization for the elderly and more waiting phase for the young adults. Besides, ellipse and teardrop-shape spatial distribution of the high-density regions are observed for the elderly and the young adults respectively. The time headway for two consecutive elders through the exit is 0.20 ± 0.06 s longer than that of the young adults. For a certain exit, the flow rate of the elderly stream is lower than that of the young stream. The capacity for the former is 0.51 p/(m s) lower than that for the latter. Consequently, the exit width for the elderly is suggested to be widened to 1.25b − 0.05 m from the width b for young adults. The results presented in this study can be used in management strategies of pedestrian flow and design of traffic facilities for the old people.",0965-8564,Not found
Analysis of freight transportation network redundancy: An application to Utah's bi-modal network for transporting coal,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.019,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Freight transportation network is an essential backbone for supporting the industrial activities and economic developments of the nation and global trade. In this paper, we extend the network-based measures recently developed by Xu et al. (2018) for assessing freight transportation network redundancy – an important component in making freight transportation networks more robust and resilient against disruptions. Redundancy of freight transportation networks is characterized by two network-based measures. The route diversity measure evaluates the existence of multiple efficient routes available for freight users or the degree of connections between a specific origin-destination (O-D) pair, while the network spare capacity measure quantifies the network-wide spare capacity with an explicit consideration of congestion effect and modal split. These two measures can complement each other by providing a two-dimensional characterization of freight transportation network redundancy that can be used to provide information to freight users as well as to assist network planners in making future infrastructure investment decisions to enhance the redundancy of freight transportation networks. A case study of the Utah freight network for transporting coal is provided to demonstrate the features of the two network-based redundancy measures as well as the applicability of assessing the redundancy of freight transportation networks. The analyses reveal that the two measures provide useful results from two perspectives that may be of benefit to freight carriers and transportation system planners.",0965-8564,Not found
"A modular, adaptive, and autonomous transit system (MAATS): A in-motion transfer strategy and performance evaluation in urban grid transit networks",10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.005,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Dynamic traffic demand has been a longstanding challenge for the conventional transit system design and operation. The recent development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) makes it increasingly realistic to develop the next generation of transportation systems with the potential to improve operational performance and flexibility. In this study, we propose an innovative transit system with autonomous modular buses (AMBs) that is adaptive to dynamic traffic demands and not restricted to fixed routes and timetables. A unique transfer operation, termed as “in-motion transfer”, is introduced in this paper to transfer passengers between coupled modular buses in motion. A two-stage model is developed to facilitate in-motion transfer operations in optimally designing passenger transfer plans and AMB trajectories at intersections. In the proposed AMB system, all passengers can travel in the shortest path smoothly without having to actually alight and transfer between different bus lines. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed transit system results in shorter travel time and a significantly reduced average number of transfers. While enjoying the above-mentioned benefits, the modular, adaptive, and autonomous transit system (MAATS) does not impose substantially higher energy consumption in comparison to the conventional bus system.",0965-8564,Not found
A hybrid discrete choice model to understand the effect of public policy on fare evasion discouragement in Bogotá's Bus Rapid Transit,10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.009,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Fare evasion is currently a significant concern for public transport systems worldwide. Evasion causes huge economic losses to operators and cities, but also negatively influences the system’s security perceptions. Despite its importance, there are few efforts to understand which observable and non-observable factors motivate individuals to evade fares in a public transport system. Most studies dealing with fare evasion evaluate the effectiveness of several policies, quantify the amount of evasion, or correlate fare evasion with system satisfaction using aggregate data. This paper proposes a Hybrid Discrete Choice model to understand current evaders’ behavior considering sociodemographic, fare evasion records, trip characteristics, user satisfaction with the transport system, and perceptual indicators. The model was estimated using a unique stated preferences survey applied to 324 fare evaders of Transmilenio, the Bogotá (Colombia) Bus Rapid Transit system, in mid-2019. This is an interesting case study because, in 2018, the evasion rate was measured for the first time and it was discovered that evaders comprised approximately 15% of their users on weekdays. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, results highlight the importance of considering observable and latent variables to understand individual behavior in examining fare evasion in similar public transport systems. Age and the evasion records resulted in being the most important observable variables in our case study. Latent variables suggest that the more the user is satisfied with the transport system, the less likely is to evade fares. However, we found that personality traits, such as individual rule-unconsciousness, moderate the effect of satisfaction on the evasion behavior. Second, our results provide evidence that the discussion between certainty and severity of punishment on fare evasion should not necessarily be centered on whether to exacerbate one of these factors. A combination of both, however, should reduce the recidivism rate.",0965-8564,Not found
Monocentric versus polycentric urban structure: Case study in Hong Kong,10.1016/j.tra.2021.05.004,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Activity resource allocation or dispersion (e.g., employment, education), transport network improvement, and property development, affect the urban community in different ways. To illuminate their intricate relations, we study the perspectives of three groups of stakeholders: i) households with heterogeneous members seeking a common residence to optimize their proximity to activity resources; ii) transport planners aiming to relieve traffic congestion; and iii) property developers aiming to maximize their housing profit through the bid-rent process. To assess the impacts of different resource allocation patterns (centralized versus dispersed), a household bid-rent and residential location choice model with heterogeneous compositions is developed, including household members’ activity destination choices and travel choices under stochastic user equilibrium. We apply this model to a new redevelopment region in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The results show that centralized resource allocation increases the producer surplus but reduces the household disposable income. Compared with dispersion in school resource allocation or transport improvement, job reallocation is the most efficient in alleviating traffic congestion as employments are dispersed into multiple centers, and inter-zonal commute trips are converted into intra-zonal trips. We also investigate the outcomes as the urban structure varies from monocentric, dual-core into multiple self-contained communities (i.e. polycentric). The results show that any accessibility gain due to a change in the urban form will be capitalized by developers into higher housing prices in the new central business district (CBD) regions, hence shrinking the consumer surplus and disposable income. Therefore, it is unlikely to find an urban form that will achieve win–win–win situations for all three stakeholder groups in the case study example.",0965-8564,Not found
Synergies of combining demand- and supply-side measures to manage congested streets,10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.002,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"An agent-based, multichannel simulation of a downtown area reveals the impacts of both time-shifting traffic demand with congestion pricing, and supplying extra capacity by banning left turns. The downtown street network was idealized, and loosely resembles central Los Angeles. On the demand-side, prices were set based on time-of-day and distance traveled. On the supply side, left-turn maneuvers were prohibited at all intersections on the network. Although both traffic management measures reduced travel costs when used alone, the left-turn ban was much less effective than pricing. When combined with pricing under congested conditions, however, the left-turn ban’s effectiveness increased considerably—it more than doubled in some cases. Furthermore, the two measures combined reduced travel costs in synergistic fashion. In some cases, this synergistic effect was responsible for 30% of the cost reduction. This strong synergy suggests that turning bans should be considered as an added option when contemplating congestion pricing.",0965-8564,Not found
A two-layer modelling framework for predicting passenger flow on trains: A case study of London underground trains,10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.001,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"A model that anticipates the passenger flow on trains will help passengers to avoid overcrowded trains in their journey planning. Such a model will also help rail industry to understand the current use of train capacity and plan the distribution of rolling stock, personnel and facilities. However, the existing studies only developed the models for forecasting the passenger flow in stations, which cannot reflect the true passenger number on trains. In this paper, a hierarchical modelling framework for passenger flow prediction is proposed. It includes two layers of fuzzy models, where a global model is used to predict for ordinary circumstances and a number of local models are used to predict the variations in passenger number due to specific factors, such as events and weather. A new data sifting method is proposed to obtain the most informative and representative data for model training, which greatly improves the modelling efficiency. The proposed method is then validated using a case study of forecasting the passenger flow of London Underground trains.",0965-8564,Not found
Optimal fleet size for a shared demand-responsive transport system with human-driven vs automated vehicles: A total cost minimization approach,10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.004,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Vehicle automation is expected to reduce the cost of shared demand-responsive transport (DRT) services. In this context, questions regarding the conditions under which fixed-route public transport can be replaced with shared on-demand services have emerged. The expected increase in competitiveness between fixed-route and on-demand services requires the development of frameworks that enable the analysis of transportation costs of alternative modes. In this research, we develop a total cost minimization model for demand-responsive door-to-door shared transportation services, including operator and user costs. Optimization variables are vehicle size and fleet size for operation with human-driven and automated vehicles. A hybrid approach is used in which the relevant variables are analytically and numerically modeled, using data from a large-scale agent-based simulation applied to the city of Munich. We compare the case in which all trip requests must be served with the case in which request rejections are allowed, based on waiting and travel times. Different demand levels and alternative scenarios for vehicle automation are analyzed. The results indicate that the performance of door-to-door on-demand shared systems depends on the operational scheme selected. For the DRT setup and vehicle assignment strategy studied, we find that if the system is forced to have no trip rejections, economies of scale are not present, and the high user costs hinder the system’s competitiveness even under the assumption of automated vehicles. In contrast, in a system that allows for trip rejections, economies of scale are present, and vehicle automation can especially reduce operator costs, increasing the system’s competitiveness against other transportation modes. Therefore, in our setting, the efficiency of the demand-responsive service depends on the ability to reject customers, which is against the spirit of a truly public transportation service. On scenario analysis, we show that a theoretical improvement in the performance of the real-time vehicle assignment strategy can significantly reduce total cost, with economies of scale under no-rejection operation. Future research needs to address whether the actual application of more complex vehicle assignment strategies can indeed make DRT systems more cost competitive while serving all trip requests.",0965-8564,Not found

The integration of these paradigms can lead to more detailed insights into the economic feasibility of Arctic routes under different policy scenarios. The results indicate that by 2035 under both a business as usual and an Arctic zero emission ECA policy scenario, combined Arctic-Suez transits becomes financially viable for a Handymax wet bulker with a moderate ice class. By 2050 the transpolar route becomes accessible for 5 months for these vessels. The results also show that implicit damage costs cannot be overlooked and that it is possible to advance towards more holistic methods for assessing economic and environmental risks and opportunities in Arctic shipping.

Exploring best practice for municipal e-scooter policy in the United States,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.025,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The transportation and mobility landscape has changed at exponential rates in recent years. This is particularly evident in the spread and use of micromobility, primarily via e-scooters, in the United States. It is widely agreed that municipalities need to regulate the deployment of this new form of mobility to capture some of the benefits that these devices provide but also mitigate the impact and risks associated with their use. This paper evaluates commercial scooter deployment within municipalities in the United States, and seeks to identify policy trends for regulating e-scooters. As many communities do not have policies in place, the study seeks to benchmark and develop a policy dialogue addressing e-scooter use and deployment. The study focuses on three specific policy strategies cities are implementing: the use of pilot programs; vendor limits or caps; and the inclusion of equity policy. The study finds that tension between these policies has the potential to constrain or accelerate the market adoption of scooters and that very few communities are designing and adopting environment strategies to regulate scooter use. These policy dialogues are worth exploration as cities accelerate trends toward micromobility.",0965-8564,Not found
Vehicle routing problem with steep roads,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.002,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Most routing decisions assume that routing costs are modelled as a weighted sum of total distance and time traveled by delivery vehicles. However, this assumption does not apply for logistics operations in cities with significant road grades. We study an extension to the VRP model that plans vehicle routes considering the combined impact of detailed road grade information and vehicle load-weight in fuel consumption cost. We refer to this model as the VRP with Steep Roads (VRP-SR), which is formulated as an integer linear program and solved heuristically. In simulated experiments performed for a mountainous metropolitan region in Chile, we estimate operating cost reductions up to 12.4 % when compared to the real cost of a plan disregarding road grade information. In addition, we obtain valuable managerial insights from our routing plans; our planned routes tend to initially use roads with relatively small grades to avoid abrupt altitude changes with a loaded vehicle. Higher altitude changes are planned after the vehicle unloads a significant fraction of its cargo. Also, we identify instances in which it is cheaper to insert an intermediate depot visit to drop off weight and split a feasible route in two subroutes to travel over mountainous areas with a lighter vehicle.",0965-8564,Not found
"Fully automated vehicles: A cost-based analysis of the share of ownership and mobility services, and its socio-economic determinants",10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.024,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"A major uncertainty in the diffusion of autonomous vehicles is the split between ownership and automated mobility services. We calculate total cost of ownership and use (TCOU) to compare four alternatives: private manually driven vehicles, private automated vehicles, automated on-demand exclusive use mobility services (ridesourcing) and automated on-demand pooled mobility services (ridesplitting), for both conventional and electric propulsions. We also included potential usefulness of travel time in the driverless vehicles in the TCOU calculations, thus including some of the non-financial factors in travel decision making. While nearly all current studies are limited to comparing average representative trips or mileage of existing vehicles, we calculate TCOUs for every vehicle in the UK National Travel Survey dataset, considering heterogeneity in mileage patterns, trip purposes, time spent driving, value of time, vehicle age, depreciation and other factors between different vehicles. The results suggest that a near-total transition to automated ride services is highly unlikely, since ownership of (automated or manually driven) vehicles continues to be the least-cost option in most cases. Even in the most pro-mobility service test case, ownership remains more cost-effective for one third of the current vehicle fleet. Regression analysis shows that higher income of the main driver, business use of the vehicle, rural location of the household or being the main household vehicle leads to a higher likelihood that automated vehicle ownership will be lower cost compared to automated mobility services. Within automated on-demand ride services, exclusive use services are cost effective for more cases compared to pooled, shared-use type options, with uncertain consequences for future travel demand.",0965-8564,Not found
Time-varying accessibility to senior centers by public transit in Philadelphia,10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.020,151,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Public transit offers older adults an important alternative travel mode for accessing social activity destinations. Given the growing size and socioeconomic diversity of the older population, transportation planners should consider how current urban transit systems can better meet their needs. In this study, we examine the time-varying accessibility to senior centers by public transit in each census tract of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Senior centers are community service and activity hubs for older adults which are typically overseen by the local area agency on aging. They offer a variety of services and social activities for older adults, including free meals, volunteering opportunities, information, and technology training. Using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data and socioeconomic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, we analyze how accessibility varies across census tracts with respect to the tract's share of older adults, particularly those in vulnerable subgroups. We found that accessibility to senior centers declines from the downtown area to the suburbs but varies considerably among the vulnerable subgroups studied. We also found that when accounting for the open hours of senior centers, accessibility to senior centers is generally lower around midday (2 PM) than during peak hours (8:30 AM) on Mondays. We used the vertical equity index to examine social disparities in accessibility among older adults. We found that while SEPTA underserves neighborhoods with higher shares of older adults, tracts with higher shares of some vulnerable subgroups are better served than those with lower shares. Specifically, neighborhoods with higher shares of households that have no cars are better served than those with higher shares of African American and Hispanic older adults. These results suggest that the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and the Philadelphia Corporation for Aging (PCA) should work together to better accommodate the diverse travel needs of older adults.",0965-8564,Not found

To date, it is still unclear who will embrace these new mobility strategies, and how they will transform travellers’ behaviours. This study identifies the key drivers determining the adoption of MaaS in two European metropolitan areas, based on a survey taken in Madrid (Spain) and Randstad (The Netherlands). Overall, we found strong positive attitudes towards MaaS. The results highlight the role played by a set of demographic, socioeconomic, and travel-related variables, after their validation with a generalized ordered logit (gologit) model. The willingness to adopt MaaS appeared to be related to personal characteristics such as gender, age, education level, occupation, and household structure. Unexpectedly, the place of residence (city versus outskirts) was not found to be significant. The acceptance of MaaS was also influenced by individuals’ mobility patterns. We detected that private car users were not significantly attracted by MaaS, while individuals engaged with public transport and shared mobility services did intend to adopt it. Our final findings will help urban authorities and transport planners to predict the population segments with a higher (and lower) probability of using MaaS. Policy efforts could stimulate MaaS acceptability in the coming years by taking these insights into account.",0965-8564,Not found
Hybrid pedestrian and transit priority zoning policies in an urban street network: Evaluating network traffic flow impacts with analytical approximation,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.009,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Pedestrianized zones are becoming an increasingly popular policy tool for cities seeking to improve “walkability”, “livability”, and reduce congestion in the urban center by prohibiting automobiles from entering a designated zone. However, pedestrianized zones can be inappropriately implemented in locations without justifiable congestion or sufficient transit alternatives. For mixed-traffic transit (e.g., bus and light-rail streetcars), the lack of reasonable transit alternatives is an issue further compounded by the traffic congestion generated from diverted driving trips concentrated around the pedestrianized zone, inadvertently slowing down both automobile traffic and mixed-traffic transit in tandem. Alternatively, to mitigate the traffic congestion impact on transit, policy makers can also designate a “transit priority” zone around the pedestrian zone, where transit is unimpeded by congestion either through transit signal priority, dedicated lanes, or both. This ensures transit provides a consistent travel alternative as congestion varies, creating a stable demand equilibrium that would otherwise be suppressed by congestion. While such a solution has been proposed in advocacy, no research has explored such a combined policy in analytical terms. This research explores the potential complementary benefits and optimal sizing of pedestrianization and transit priority zones through analytical evaluation in an idealized rectilinear city. The model is intended to provide insights regarding traffic impacts, optimal zone sizing, system capacity, and the justifiable thresholds for implementing complementary pedestrianization and transit priority zones in a city.",0965-8564,Not found
Implementing commercial autonomous road haulage in freight operations: An industry perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.003,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Interest from industry and policy makers on the use of autonomous goods vehicles (AGVs) for commercial use, has increased rapidly as the underlying technology has developed.

The research focuses on large goods vehicles, capable of automated driving, where the driver is not required for some or all of the journey, for logistics operations between suppliers, manufacturing plant, and retailer. The data is collected through semi-structured interviews and scoring questionnaires. All 76 participants had experience working in the logistics industry, from various parts of the operations process. The data was analysed using thematic analysis followed with the results subsequently ranked by participants to identify the importance and perceived impact. Results revealed a near-term barrier for adoption of autonomous technology, is the lack of standardisation, as technology is progressing in many different directions, with little consultation on what features are needed or how they will be implemented. The findings show the main impact of commercialisation of autonomous road haulage are overall maintenance cost reduction, due to less wear and tear, and operational cost reduction, especially for long-haul journeys, as vehicles can operate for longer hours. Moreover, despite barriers in the short term, such as public acceptance and transition costs, these will likely be outweighed by improvements in efficiency and utilisation. Based on findings from the study, we present six key considerations for the introduction of commercial autonomous road haulage, which can be used as a guide for policy makers, insurance companies, transport planning authorities, and vehicle manufacturers.",0965-8564,Not found

This study contributes to the literature by providing firsthand insights about how demand for shared parking is formed and how different policy implication can be made accordingly. The results indicate that pricing persists to be the sole most effective parking policy, however non-price-related attributes can help decision makers to make more informative decision when it comes to different pricing schemes. The study also highlights that shared parking can perform a significant role in accommodating the surplus arising from the excessive parking demand and inadequate supply up to almost 40% of demand. The outcome of this study is anticipated to inform and equip city authorities with advanced knowledge about such an emerging phenomenon which can help developing regulations before the concept is out of control.

Determinants to parking mode alternatives: A model integrating technology acceptance model and satisfaction–loyalty model,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.010,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"As an emerging technology that does not rely on the construction of several parking facilities and effectively relieves the pressure of urban parking, shared parking is widely promoted. However, users may turn to conventional parking mode because of concerns about the performance of shared parking modes. Therefore, to determine why users change parking mode and to improve the behavior patronage rate of shared parking mode, studying the factors influencing users’ behavior intentions is very important. Technology acceptance model and satisfaction–loyalty model are combined to construct a comprehensive framework for analyzing the key factors that affect the behavioral intentions of shared parking mode and to describe the multidimensional characteristics of the behavioral intentions. The hypotheses were tested and analyzed on the basis of the empirical data of Harbin and the structural equation model (SEM). Eventually, a multigroup SEM analysis, which takes gender as a moderating variable, is used. Results show that the re-patronage of shared parking is significantly affected by its technology acceptance and that the perceived risk is the key variable leading to change parking mode. In addition, the factor invariance of the identified model framework is examined against gender, and few significant differences are found. The framework is expected to contribute to operators in increasing their market share of shared parking services and to governments in promoting new transportation technologies in cities.",0965-8564,Not found
Delayed reaction towards emerging COVID-19 variants of concern: Does history repeat itself?,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.007,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"After more than a year with COVID-19, it becomes increasingly clear that certain variants of concern have the potential to be game changers, determining the future of our aviation. These variants pose significant health threats and possibly undermine ongoing vaccination efforts. Recent research showed that flight bans on the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in January 2020 were implemented too late and therefore, turned out to be largely ineffective, enabling a swift turn into a fully-blown pandemic. In this study, we investigate the following question: How effective were existing flight bans against the newly emerged variants of concern? In other words: Do airlines and countries happen to repeat the same mistake again? We analyze the spread of the three most prevalent variants of concern right now: B.1.1.7 (known as the UK variant), B.1.351 (known as the South African variant), and P.1 (known as the Brazilian variant). We find that many countries, again, implemented flights bans once the mutated virus had enough time to be imported via air transportation. To support our empirical analysis further, we designed and implemented a compartmental network spreading model on top of worldwide flight data for the years 2020 and 2021. We observe that the model predictions are rather accurate and confirm our findings. Overall, we hope that our study encourages air transportation stakeholders and policy makers to avoid repeating earlier mistakes in the future, with the ultimate goal to overcome COVID-19 entirely.",0965-8564,Not found
Cycling behaviour and socioeconomic disadvantage: An investigation based on the English National Travel Survey,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.004,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"One of the main challenges for policymakers aiming to promote cycling in car-oriented transport systems is how to increase social diversity among its users. The under-representation of certain groups makes it difficult to normalise cycling and distribute its benefits throughout society. Many studies have explored cycling levels in relation to age and gender, and to a lesser extent disability and ethnicity. Less attention has been paid to bicycle use related to income and other socioeconomic factors associated with disadvantage. This study aims to better understand the relationship between income and other factors of socioeconomic disadvantage and cycling behaviour. We analysed data from the English National Travel Survey to estimate the likelihood of cycling participation (if individuals cycle at all), cycling frequency (‘how often’ they cycle), and cycling distance (‘how far’ they cycle) using regression models. We found that people in lower-income households cycle less for transport, particularly for commuting, than people in higher-income households. However, no income inequalities were found for leisure cycling. In addition, low-income leisure cyclists were found to cycle more often, but higher-income leisure cyclists further. Our findings may have important policy implications. Favouring a broader focus on non-commuting cycling and subsidising cycle access and maintenance could help to diversify cycling.",0965-8564,Not found
The causes and consequences of curb parking management,10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.007,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"The curb is a monopoly good: it is network infrastructure owned entirely by cities. Unlike most network infrastructure, however, it is not managed primarily by prices. Cities instead allocate the curb with a confusing patchwork of meters, time limits, permits, and—perhaps most notably—fines. Urban parking thus stands out among network infrastructure for its low level of payment, low level of quality, and large share of revenue derived from punishment. We develop an explanation for why this is so, which emphasizes the curb’s public ownership and low production costs. We then use both qualitative and quantitative methods to examine some of our theory’s implications. We draw on descriptive data from a variety of US cities, but focus primarily on the city of Los Angeles as a case study.",0965-8564,Not found
Design and operation of feeder systems in the era of automated and electric buses,10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.015,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This paper evaluates the impact of vehicle automation and electrification on the applicability of fixed routes and door-to-door services to supply a feeder transit solution in suburban areas. These technologies will modify the current cost structure of the bus system depending on how mature they are, reducing operating costs and increasing capital costs. By means of a continuum approximation model, we evaluate the performance for users and agency of the two feeder strategies in different scenarios of technological development. The results show that automation has the main impact on the applicability between the two feeder alternatives while the effects of electrification are considerably smaller. The future applicability of door-to-door trips reaches wider ranges, although this change is especially significant under some circumstances of technology, service area and users. The expansion of this range is relevant in case the automated bus is mature enough (high reduction of operating cost and low vehicle acquisition price), the areas are small, the trips are short and the value of time is high. However, the results reveal that fixed routes will remain a competitive feeder solution in a wide range of scenarios. We identify that the demand density threshold grows sharply in front of any reduction of agency costs once its value is around 200–300 pax/km2-h. Therefore, flexible services will gain applicability especially in environments that allow reaching this threshold.",0965-8564,Not found
"The impact of social externality information on fostering sustainable travel mode choice: A behavioral experiment in Zhengzhou, China",10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.003,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Urban leaders in areas with high air pollution often face the dual task of reducing pollution levels while educating the public about the health impacts of pollution and preventive measures. Transportation policies to cut motorized personal vehicle use are often a key part of pollution reduction efforts. One type of these policies is information interventions educating commuters of the higher emissions impact of cars. This study evaluates the impact of such an information intervention on car commuters’ intention to switch from car use to transit, biking, or walking in Zhengzhou, China. Further, it tracks how this greening impact evolves as drivers are given additional public health information regarding Zhengzhou’s severe air pollution level, its health effects, and the reduced pollution exposure when driving compared with transiting, biking, or walking outside in polluted air. Using a randomized controlled survey experiment with a treatment group of 281 participants and a control group of 280 participants drawn from Zhengzhou workers who typically commute by car, this study applies multinomial logit models and difference-in-difference estimation to estimate the information intervention’s impact. We find that while emissions information interventions are initially highly effective in reducing intended car usage, the effect is progressively dampened as respondents learn of the level of local air pollution and the risks of outdoor pollution exposure. Some greening effects do, however, remain even at the end of the experiment. The results suggest that governments in polluted areas must be aware of how policies in different segments of their portfolio interact and support broader initiatives like mixed-use planning and transit extension, simultaneously cutting transportation emissions and creating shorter commute durations with lower outdoor pollution exposure.",0965-8564,Not found

Unlike previous cross-sectional studies, we calibrate a dynamic car ownership model with a pseudo panel constructed from repeated cross-sectional travel surveys, controlling for the persistence of car ownership and unobserved heterogeneity. We find that the tightening of vehicle quota control and improved rail transit accessibility have reduced households’ desire to purchase cars. The long-run effect of these two policies is larger than their short-run effect due to the existence of true state dependence. The impact of expressway-network expansion is insignificant.",0965-8564,Not found
Phasing in electric vehicles: Does policy focusing on operating emission achieve net zero emissions reduction objectives?,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.001,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are being integrated into the UK transport network to reduce operating emissions (OEs) as BEVs produce zero emission at point of use. True OEs depend upon fuel source emissions, and ‘cradle-to-grave’ life cycle emissions. This paper investigates method comparisons of a simple operation emissions model (OPEM) against a life cycle analysis (LCA) (Transport Energy and Air Pollution Model (TEAM-UK)) approach to inform on the UK’s target to achieve net zero emissions. Emission comparisons from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and BEVs between 2017 and 2050 using TEAM-UK (estimating both OEs and full LCA) and the OPEM (OEs only) across three vehicle scenarios were analysed: (S1) 100% ICEVs, (S2) new ICEVs banned from 2040, and (S3) new ICEVs banned from 2030. Both model outputs varied between scenarios. The OPEM predicted 19% more emissions in S1 (OEs only comparison). Differences between methods in S2 and S3 were minimal (<0.1% and <3% respectively). Comparing the LCA with its own OE estimate indicates OEs remain at approximately 40% of total emissions suggesting they are a strong candidate for monitoring and policy targeting. These comparisons would imply the simpler OE approach is robust for a precautionary approach to assessing changes in OEs for policy implementation impact assessments of ultra-low emission vehicle initiatives. Development of future emission policies should consider both LCA and OPEMs, as although LCAs give more complete results, OPEMs can provide rapid, low data requirement, useful policy guidance. A stringent shift towards earlier BEV adoption is recommended, however, to approach net zero emissions a mode shift away from private cars is required.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of high-speed railway on urban housing prices in China: A network accessibility perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.006,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Applying the social network analysis (SNA) approach, this paper investigates the impact of high-speed rail (HSR) on urban housing prices from the perspective of network accessibility. Based on a sample of 285 cities in China over 2009–2017, we find a positive effect of HSR network accessibility on urban housing prices. An increase in HSR network accessibility (i.e., degree point or closeness centrality) by one standard deviation causes about a 10.3% increase in average housing prices. Evidence also suggests that this effect varies across regions and housing types. Our results are robust to different model specifications and alternative measures of HSR accessibility. The findings offer insights into the space–time economic laws with important policy implications regarding spatial disparities and regional economic convergence in China.",0965-8564,Not found
Investigating the determinants to retain spurious-loyalty passengers: A data-fusion based approach,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.005,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Sustaining passengers’ loyalty towards bus service has been regarded as the key to secure its market share. However, passengers are not homogenous in terms of behavioral loyalty or attitudinal loyalty. Therefore, the determinants to retain loyalty may differ across each group of passengers. This study proposed a data-fusion based clustering method to segment passengers. An empirical study of Xiamen, China was given. Specifically, by fusing the smart card data and the survey data, the method measured passengers’ behavioral and attitudinal loyalty simultaneously. As a result, spurious-loyalty passengers were identified, who were characterized as behaviorally loyal but attitudinal disloyal; they held the most potential to shift to other transport modes. In order to retain the spurious-loyalty passengers, a novel model framework was built to investigate the determinants of driving them to continue using public transportation. The results indicated that the passengers’ satisfaction fully mediated between service value and attitudinal loyalty, as found in previous studies. Service value was unveiled to exert a significant and positive impact on predicting the passengers’ satisfaction and attitudinal loyalty. However, service value was not only determined by the passengers’ utilitarian value (perceived service quality), but also involved with their hedonic value (emotional dependence on public transportation which came from the passengers’ long-term involvement); hedonic value was demonstrated highly correlated with utilitarian value. In addition, we justified that utilitarian value could be separately measured by the quality of basic service attributes and the quality of value-added service attributes; they were revealed to exhibit non-linear and heterogeneous effects on the passengers’ satisfaction. Moreover, the index score of variables was employed to indicate the specific service attributes that needed to be improved to sustain the targeted passengers; practical suggestions to the specific direction of improvement were provided for transport sectors and public transport operators.",0965-8564,Not found

Development of a search and rescue framework for maritime freight shipping in the Arctic,10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.006,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"In recent years, Arctic routes have been receiving increasing attention, as they offer a solution to capacity bottlenecks on the most frequented routes, such as the Suez Canal, Strait of Malacca, and Panama Canal. Due to climate change and melting polar ice, Arctic routes, especially the Northern Sea Route/Northeast Passage and Northwest Passage, are becoming increasingly competitive. The consequence of this development is an increase in maritime traffic in Arctic waters. Due to the harsh environment, maritime activities in the Arctic are associated with numerous risks, as reflected in the 512 incidents in the last decade. Therefore, sufficient search and rescue capabilities are necessary to ensure safety. Thus far, various studies have focused on different components of search and rescue, such as port infrastructure, icebreaker capabilities, and navigation. However, there is no study offering a framework for the required further development of search and rescue capabilities. Therefore, in this paper, a search and rescue framework is proposed. The development of the framework is based on a literature review of dimensions of search and rescue in the Arctic. Semi-structured interviews with 24 experts regarding the identified dimensions were conducted. The results of the qualitative content analysis show a total of 23 top-codes and 50 subcodes, which are presented and discussed. The discussion leads to the presentation of the search and rescue framework, including the dimensions port infrastructure, search and rescue equipment, communication technology, navigation technology, standards and agreements, and cooperation and the respective top-codes.

Heterogeneity in activity-travel patterns of public transit users: An application of latent class analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.011,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Public transit is considered a sustainable mode of transport that can address automobile dependency and provide environmental, economic, and societal benefits. However, with typical temporal and spatial constraints such as fixed routes and schedules, transfer requirements, waiting times, and access/egress issues, public transit offers lower accessibility and mobility services than private vehicles and thus it is considered a less attractive mode to many prospective users. To improve the performance of transit and in turn to increase its usage, a broader understanding of the daily activity-travel patterns of transit users is fundamental. In this context, this study analyzed transit-based activity-travel patterns by classifying users via Latent Class Analysis (LCA). Using data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, the LCA model suggested that transit users could be split into five distinct classes where each class has a representative activity-travel pattern. Class 1 constituted employed white males who made transit-dominant simple work tours. Class 2 was composed of employed white females who made complex work tours. Employed white millennials comprised Class 3 and made multimodal complex tours. Transit Class 4 were non-white younger or older adult groups who made transit-dominant simple non-work tours. Last, Class 5 members made complex non-work tours with recurrent transit use and comprised single older women. This study provided insights regarding the variations of activity-travel patterns and the associated market segments of transit users in the United States. The results can assist transit agencies in identifying transit user groups with particular activity patterns and to consider market strategies that can address their travel needs.",0965-8564,Not found
Modelling the impact of rail delays on passenger satisfaction,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.002,152,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Rail use and rail traffic in the UK increased substantially in the 25 years from 1994 to the end of 2019, a situation which led to progressively more delays and increasingly dissatisfied passengers. This study aims to quantify how disruptions to rail services are perceived by passengers to highlight situations that cause the highest rates of dissatisfaction so that they can be more effectively managed by the rail industry. Passenger satisfaction data from 7000 or so responses to the UK National Rail Passenger Survey (NRPS) where passengers had experienced delays were integrated with Network Rail data of the exact operational performance (e.g. train punctuality, service frequency, delay cause, magnitude of delay) that was encountered on each surveyed trip. An ordered logit model was then applied which allows for random taste variation to understand how passenger satisfaction was affected by rail delays. The study found that passengers reacted negatively to delays over 30 min, and dissatisfaction was exacerbated when passengers had to stand during the journey and/or received poor information, and when trains were cancelled. Policy implications for train operators include: (1) only cancel trains as a last resort; (2) prioritise trains approaching the ten minute delay threshold; (3) prioritise minimising delays to trains carrying high numbers of standing passengers; (4) enhance information quality and information delivery mechanisms as far as possible. Government should re-orientate franchise contracts to: (1) incentivise train operating companies to place more emphasis on passenger satisfaction when implementing service recovery strategies; and (2) improve delay information provision. Already the results are helping rail operators and practitioners to develop targeted recovery strategies aimed at minimising passenger dissatisfaction. This is the first academic study to investigate how rail passenger satisfaction is influenced by operational factors such as real-time delay, train frequency, train cancellations as well as delay causes.",0965-8564,Not found

The social distancing requirement, with the aim of reducing contact risk in public transit, could exacerbate traffic congestion and emissions. We propose a simulation tool to evaluate the trade-offs between traffic congestion, emissions, and policies impacting travel behavior to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 including social distancing and working from home. Open-source agent-based simulation models are used to evaluate the transportation system usage for the case study of New York City. A Post Processing Software for Air Quality (PPS-AQ) estimation is used to evaluate the air quality impacts. Finally, system-wide contact exposure on the subway is estimated from the traffic simulation output. The social distancing requirement in public transit is found to be effective in reducing contact exposure, but it has negative congestion and emission impacts on Manhattan and neighborhoods at transit and commercial hubs. While telework can reduce congestion and emissions citywide, in Manhattan the negative impacts are higher due to behavioral inertia and social distancing. The findings suggest that contact exposure to COVID-19 on subways is relatively low, especially if social distancing practices are followed. The proposed integrated traffic simulation models and air quality estimation model can help policymakers evaluate the impact of policies on traffic congestion and emissions as well as identifying hot spots, both temporally and spatially.",0965-8564,Not found

In the focus groups, users mentioned relatively more benefits and barriers of EVs, while non-users spontaneously stated that a limited charging network at the urban level could be an issue. The SP survey suggested that being a user did not trigger a change in environmental attitudes; on the other hand, it significantly boosted perceptions of maintenance costs and driving range. Additionally, discrete choice models estimated from the SP data suggested a possibly null willingness to pay for urban charging infrastructure, expressed as a percentage of current gas stations, among the user group.

Relocating operational and damaged bikes in free-floating systems: A data-driven modeling framework for level of service enhancement,10.1016/j.tra.2021.09.010,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Free-floating bike sharing is an innovative and sustainable travel mode, where shared bikes can be picked up and returned at any proper place on the streets and not just at docking stations. Nevertheless, in these systems, two major problems arise. One is the imbalance of free-floating shared bikes (FFSB) between zones due to one-way trips, the other is the damaged bikes that must be brought for repair. In this study, a modeling framework for dynamic relocating operational and damaged bikes is proposed that starts with predicting the number and location of shared bikes using deep learning algorithms. The demand forecasting model adopts the Encoder-Decoder architecture embedded with the attention mechanism to further enhance the model’s prediction ability and flexibility. Then, a data-driven optimization model for FFSB relocations is presented, where the multi-period optimization is applied to dynamically plan the relocation activities throughout the day. A new hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that incorporates variable neighborhood search (VNS) and enhanced simulated annealing (ESA) algorithm is developed for solving the relocating problem, in which satisfactory performance is observed from the numerical example. We test the proposed framework with the real-world FFSB data from Beijing, China. The results show that relocating both operational and damaged bikes timely decreases the probability of users finding damaged bikes in the system, but leads to higher relocation costs. For peak-hours, considering only the operational bikes for relocation is the most effective strategy given the limited relocation resources. It is urgent at those times of the day to focus on providing bikes to clients where they are undersupplied.",0965-8564,Not found
A combined dial-a-ride and fixed schedule ferry service for coastal cities,10.1016/j.tra.2021.09.004,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"As large cities continue growing, the pressure on public transportation system increases. Water transit infrastructure has gained increased interest for coastal cities in the last years as it presents great potential for reducing congestion on urban road networks. Furthermore, the evolution of autonomous ferry systems enables more frequent departures, shorter detours, and on-demand services with many smaller ferry units operating without captain and crew on board. While most of current ferry passenger transportation systems operate on fixed scheduled routes non-autonomously, in the last decades, there has been an increased interest in on-demand public transit services as these provide more flexibility and customized services. This paper investigates the potentials of combining fixed schedule and on-demand ferry services. For this, we present a request assignment procedure and a ferry routing methodology that are embedded in a simulation framework. Through this, we examine the impact of fleet composition (i.e., number of scheduled and on-demand ferries) on the fulfilled customer demand and the service times of requests.

Operational scenarios are analysed using different types of on-demand solutions that can complement the existing GO Transit commuter train system. Various use cases of demand-responsive vehicles are explored in terms of vehicle capacity and fleet-size. It is assumed that the existing car-based trips to the four train stations in Markham would be replaced by an on-demand rideshare transit system. The on-demand transit system is simulated using the PTV MaaS Modeller in combination with a mesoscopic simulation, involving 1,865 trip requests within the morning peak from 7AM to 10AM. Wait-time, travel time, demand served, cost, and environmental impact are used as indicators to rate various options. Evaluating the results we came to the conclusion that three cases using vans are providing favourable outcomes. The van-based scenario using 75% of an optimal fleet size and a low detour factor turned out to be very appropriate with regard to the case study. A passenger in this scenario would at an average spend 3 min waiting for the service to arrive and 10 min in the vehicle, costing 7CAD for the ride. With a typical level of public transit subsidies applied, a 7% monthly saving is expected compared to using a private car and paying for parking fees. The scenario also results in 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions when compared to current personal vehicle based trips.

Using TNC trip data from Chicago, we investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of authorized ride-splitting trips in 2019. We found that the willingness to share TNC trips differed across neighborhoods with different demographics, socioeconomic status, and built environment characteristics. The willingness to share was related to price and trip duration. We estimate logistic regression and random forest models to determine the marginal price and time effects on the decision to share. The results indicate the probability of authorizing a ride-splitting trip is highly elastic to the price per mile and the random forest model had better predictive accuracy than the logistic model. Additionally, we examine the importance and marginal effects of total price and trip duration.

Evidence of a post-COVID change in travel behaviour – Self-reported expectations of commuting in Melbourne,10.1016/j.tra.2021.09.009,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"This paper addresses the question, “Will post-pandemic travel behaviour, when the virus has gone, be different to pre-pandemic travel?”. It adopts an online survey where respondents were asked to report changes in travel during the various stages of the pandemic and expectations of future travel after the virus has gone. The paper focusses on commuting including total commuting, work from home (WFH), employment, travel mode volume and share and timing of morning commute trips using reported behaviour during pandemic shutdowns; and expectations of commuting when the virus has gone. The paper provides evidence that travel behaviour post-pandemic might be different to pre-pandemic travel. It suggests that after the pandemic, public transport ridership, which declined steeply during the pandemic, will return but not to pre-pandemic levels. A post-pandemic reduction effect of around 20% in transit commuting is expected. This effect is supported using secondary evidence from a number of international cities. Results imply a mode shift from public transport use to car driving; this will be particularly large for CBD/downtown areas and is likely to result in peak period traffic congestion after the virus has gone. Work from home increased substantially during the pandemic; this will reduce after the pandemic as enforced WFH is replaced by voluntary WFH. Nevertheless, a sustained future ongoing increase in WFH above pre-pandemic levels is suggested, acting to reduce peak commuting by 6% and commuting to Melbourne CBD by 20%. However, reductions in commuting due to WFH do not offset mode shift from public transport to car driving resulting in a net increase in car use after the pandemic. Infection fear is a new top concern of public transport users since the pandemic. This fear has transitioned from ‘fresh infection fear’; the initial concerns when the pandemic started to ‘residual infection fear’; a long-term effect when the virus has gone. Implications of the findings for research and practice are discussed.",0965-8564,Not found
Transport disrupted – Substituting public transport by bike or car under Covid 19,10.1016/j.tra.2021.09.002,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"The Covid 19 pandemic has caused dramatic disruptions in the public transport sector that has seen a stark downturn in many cities across the globe, calling into question previous efforts to reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions by expanding this sector. Especially, the current surge of individual car use is worrying and the question remains which users might be able and willing to substitute public transport by cycling. This effect is interesting to study for the case of Hanover Region, because of the well-developed biking infrastructure that makes biking a viable alternative to individual car use. In this paper, we analyze survey data from June 2020 on the use of transportation modes before and during the pandemic in the Hanover Region. We ask if and how the over 4.000 participants substitute public transport and what characterizes those who chose biking over individual car use. We use multivariate regression models and find evidence that Stadtbahn (local light rail) and bus are substituted by bike, car and working from home, while train use is not significantly replaced by car and seems to be positively related to bike use. The data also shows that women have a higher level of fear of infection than men have during public transport use and therefore reduce public transport use more. Moreover, income displays a positive effect on increased car use while cycling is independent of socio-economic indicators but instead driven by the eco-consciousness of users. Surprisingly, we find that car use was increased in particular by residents of Hanover city, while it was decreased by residents of less densely populated urban areas in the region.",0965-8564,Not found
Does a residential relocation enable satisfying travel?,10.1016/j.tra.2021.09.006,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Transport-related residential self-selection indicates that people try to live in a neighbourhood in line with their travel preferences and needs. Although studies have found that travel attitudes are mostly aligned with urban form characteristics of the residential location, no studies have explored whether people are actually able to travel in their preferred way after having relocated. In this study we analyse whether individuals’ travel patterns are consistent with their travel preferences following residential relocation and if this congruency affects their travel satisfaction. Results from 1650 recently relocated residents in the city of Ghent (Belgium) indicate that most respondents were able to change their travel behaviour in congruence with their travel attitudes. The study found that a decrease in travel duration, distance, car use, and public transport use, and an increase in walking and cycling increased travel satisfaction. This is particularly true when changes in travel behaviour interacted with travel attitudes. Results show that when walking and cycling levels change in line with travel attitudes, travel satisfaction increases strongly. However, the interaction between travel behaviour changes and travel attitudes does not always explain travel satisfaction (improvements). We found, for instance, that individuals with reduced travel durations, despite having a positive attitude towards travel in general, have high levels of travel satisfaction (improvements). The findings indicate that built environment interventions enabling a transport-related self-selection process have the potential to contribute to satisfying travel and thereby to improve subjective well-being of residents.",0965-8564,Not found
"Associations between built environment, perceived walkability/bikeability and metro transfer patterns",10.1016/j.tra.2021.09.007,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Most studies that address the integration of active modes (i.e., walking and bicycling) and public transit tend to focus on either transfer distance or feeder mode choice. Few articles have reported the relationships between the built environment (D-variables) and transfer patterns (e.g., transfer distance and mode choice) in a single study. Furthermore, only very few studies accounted for travelers’ judgements of walkability and/or bikeability and distinguished between access and egress trips. This paper fills these gaps in the literature using data collected in Nanjing, China. A random parameter Tobit and a random parameter multinomial logistic model are estimated to investigate respectively (i) the association of perceived walkability/bikeability and features of the built environment in metro catchment areas on walking/bicycling distance of access/egress trips and (ii) the probability of choosing active modes as transfer modes. The modeling results reveal that perceived walkability/bikeability and features of the built environment are more significantly correlated with mode choice behavior than with transfer distance. Moreover, walking/bicycling distance and access/egress mode choice tend to be strongly associated with perceived walkability and bikeability as well as with features of the built environment. The results are helpful in deepening urban planners and policymakers’ understanding of how to design built environments that maximize the integration of active modes and metro.",0965-8564,Not found
What is your shopping travel style? Heterogeneity in US households’ online shopping and travel,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.013,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Although online shopping has been shown to interact with travel behavior in several ways, most studies to date focused on individual-level behavior in non-representative, geographically limited samples, making it difficult to derive clear profiles of shoppers. Using the 2017 US National Household Travel Survey, which included information on online shopping frequency, we estimated a latent class model to identify different shopper types (classes) that exhibited distinct travel and online shopping behavior. We found four classes: time-pressured shoppers, dual-channel shoppers, traditional shoppers, and infrequent shoppers and travelers, that differed in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and stages of life. Our results suggest that this heterogeneity may extend to the effects of online shopping on shopping travel, for instance, with substitution effects being dominant for one class whereas complementarity effects may be dominant for another. These findings can inform the design of tailored policies to mitigate the sustainability impacts of online shopping while also addressing the various classes’ needs. Further research is needed to untangle the complex relationships between online shopping and travel behavior, especially considering this heterogeneity and the modification effect.",0965-8564,Not found
The economics of low emission zones,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.016,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"This paper provides two microeconomic models that derive the social cost of a low emission zone (LEZ) for light vehicles. We apply the models to a proposed LEZ for light vehicles in Stockholm, which would prohibit diesel cars of Euro 5 or lower and gasoline cars of Euro 4 or lower in the inner city (25 km2) and conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed LEZ. The first model is based on how an increase in user cost impacts traffic volumes in the inner city. This rather conventional user cost calculation of drivers’ loss requires however some strong assumptions. The second model shows that drivers’ losses can be calculated based on price changes observed on the used car market. Our empirical results indicate that the welfare loss resulting from the two models are of the same magnitude. The forecast benefits of the LEZ consist primarily of air quality improvements leading to health benefits. Even if our empirical results must be interpreted with caution, it seems clear that the costs considerably outweigh the benefits in this case study.",0965-8564,Not found
A modeling framework for designing and evaluating curbside traffic management policies at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport,10.1016/j.tra.2021.07.013,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Emerging mobility technologies are changing the transportation system landscape. This is especially evident at airports, such as the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). Without careful analysis, these changes could lead to inefficient and costly airport operations. This paper presents a modeling framework that integrates travel mode encoding, demand projection, and microsimulation to enable airports to develop, simulate, and evaluate curbside traffic managements policies and measure their impact. The framework is utilized to analyze several traffic scenarios and policies for DFW: a baseline scenario which represents DFW traffic pattern as observed in 2018 and projected to 2045, a transit network company (TNC) electrification policy, a TNC queuing policy, a policy that increased transit ridership, a bus-only policy which considers the use of only buses inside DFW, an autonomous vehicle (AV) policy which investigates the impact of autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption on airport operations, and an example COVID-19 scenario which models the impact of the COVID19 pandemic. The simulations’ results demonstrate that: increasing the DFW transit ridership postpones the need for airport curbside expansion the most; encouraging shared-mobility with the bus-only policy produces the most savings in curbside congestion delays; automation and electrification for all passenger vehicle trips to/from DFW generates the most saving in fuel consumption and emissions; and uncontrolled AV adoption incurs the highest increase in fuel consumption, delay, and emissions and could require immediate airport capacity extension. Without policy intervention or investment in additional infrastructure capacity, these results predict the current operations would face significant congestion on high demand days starting as early as 2028. While derived in close partnership with DFW, the methodology presented here can be generalized to any airport.",0965-8564,Not found
Analyzing bicycle level of service using virtual reality and deep learning technologies,10.1016/j.tra.2021.09.003,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Bicycle Level of Service (BLOS) provides an essential tool for evaluating the operations of low-carbon bicycle facilities and prioritizing investment in new bicycle facilities under various constraints. This study aimed at developing a LOS method for assessing bicycle facilities in the metropolitan areas of China. Using this method, we addressed major challenges in obtaining user ratings of bicycle facilities and captured senses of satisfaction of bike users riding on bicycle facilities. Virtual Reality (VR) technique was introduced to obtain data by creating 120 immersive settings or scenarios for participants. A hundred of bicyclists or participants with a wide range of characters were recruited. These participants were asked to express their senses of satisfaction under predefined physical conditions of bike facilities and traffic conditions. Their Satisfaction Rating Scores (SRS) were documented. The statistical relationships between rider’s feelings and bike facilities/traffic conditions were modeled and verified through a symbolic regression (or an effective deep learning) approach. The model is demonstrated to be reliable in predicting SRS of bicyclists with a high correlation coefficient. This study also developed a set of LOS criteria based on the cumulative distribution of satisfaction scores. These LOS criteria are simple to use and effective in assessing operational performance of existing bicycle facilities and providing decision makers with insightful guidance for planning, designing, and operating new active transportation facilities.",0965-8564,Not found

Strict COVID-19 lockdowns made home delivery an essential service and a lifeline for many households that, for travel restrictions or health concerns, were not able to utilize traditional shopping methods. This research studies the impact of socio-demographic variables and e-commerce attitudes on household deliveries for seven product categories (groceries, meals, electronics, household and office goods, recreational items, and fashion, beauty and personal care products, and medicine/health-related products) during the lockdown period in the greater Portland metropolitan region. To understand these impacts, exploratory factor analysis and choice models with latent variables are estimated utilizing data collected from an online survey representing the population in the greater Portland metropolitan region. The results indicate that each factor has a unique profile in terms of significant socio-demographic variables. A novel contribution of this research is to study the impact on home deliveries of non-traditional variables like health and safety concerns and the presence of household members with disabilities during a pandemic. The results show that health concerns are very influential and that there are substantial differences across factors on delivery rate and expenditure levels.

This article presents a comprehensive data validation effort (data completion and correction through immediate call-backs of the survey participants) on travel and non-travel information as part of a one-week Mobility-Activity-Expenditure Diary Survey. Validation recovered 2.5 percent reporting days of mobile persons with complete information on trips and increased the number of trips of pre-existing mobile reporting days by 3.5 percent. The characteristics of these trips confirm and extend the findings from item-nonresponse studies without validation: The majority of the new trips begin in the afternoon; they are mainly short and irregular; the most important trip purposes are home, work, shopping, and leisure. 37 percent of the new trips generated completely new tours; females seem to under-report less than men do. The analysis of the information on the time use (activities) between trips showed that the data was recorded with high accuracy and completeness even before validation. This study confirms typical item-nonresponse patterns and provides a solution for their mitigation through direct follow-up validation.

What does the quantum of working from home do to the value of commuting time used in transport appraisal?,10.1016/j.tra.2021.09.001,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"The need to recognise and account for the influence of working from home on commuting activity has never been so real as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given a recognition that WFH activity during the pandemic has reduced the amount of commuting activity compared to pre-COVID-19, the inevitable question is raised as to what this might mean for some of the crucial inputs in the appraisal of transport initiatives. One critical value used in benefit-cost analysis is the value of time which converts time into monetary units in the calculation of user benefits. We are interested in whether reduced commuting activity is associated with higher or lower willing to pay to save time. We investigate this possibility with data from the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area in late 2020 when working from home was at a high level. The findings of a higher average commuter VoT have major implications for the VoT used in transport appraisal given that time savings are the largest user benefit. We suggest a percentage adjustment required to align with the ‘new normal’ as currently known.",0965-8564,Not found
Interaction behaviour of active mobility users in shared space,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.017,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Commuting on space shared by active mobility users such as pedestrians and cyclists is of great safety concerns due to users’ differences in sizes and speeds. This provides the impetus to study the interactive behaviour of pedestrians and cyclists along shared footpaths in Singapore, which is considered as a type of non-motorised shared space. Online survey responses from 292 pedestrians and 300 cyclists were gathered. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling based on a theoretical framework that integrates various behaviour theories. In essence, the findings suggest that pedestrians adjust their behaviour (compensate) for their own perceived risk level and behave more cautiously if the risks are higher. However, as they perceive cyclists’ risk level to be relatively higher, pedestrians tend to be less cautious (than the cyclists). On the contrary, cyclists compensate for pedestrians’ risk level. Moreover, from safety perspective, overtaking interactions are more critical than on-coming interactions in terms of safety and users’ behaviour control. A better understanding of the potential risks and respective right-of-way is important. With better behavioural control, users are more likely to behave positively.",0965-8564,Not found
The impacts of shared e-scooters on bus ridership,10.1016/j.tra.2021.08.019,153,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Shared electric scooters (shared e-scooters) are rapidly growing in popularity across the United States. In 2019, more than 88 million shared e-scooter trips occurred nationwide. However, the impact of this growing mode on transit ridership is still largely unknown and limited to the findings of user surveys. The overarching goal of this study is to conduct an empirical analysis to quantify the impact of shared e-scooters on bus ridership using Louisville, Kentucky, as a case study conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess if shared e-scooters decrease or increase bus ridership, this study evaluated more than half a million shared e-scooters trips, and estimated several daily, weekly, and monthly fixed effects regression models of route level bus ridership. The results of the preferred fixed effect regression models indicate that shared e-scooters do not have a significant impact on local bus ridership. However, the model results suggest that shared e-scooters could potentially complement express bus routes as they serve the first/last mile of a trip, but further research on express routes is recommended. Most critically, the results of this study indicate that shared e-scooters are not one of the primary causes of bus ridership decline in Louisville. This finding is important for cities across the United States as they explore the causes of the recent declines in bus ridership.",0965-8564,Not found

Regional travel demand forecasts as well as transportation system analyses depend on datasets that provide origins and destinations of travel for various modes, purposes of travel, socio-economic characteristics of the system users, and other attributes critical for understanding travel demand. GPS-based household travel surveys emerged as a state-of-the-practice method to collect travel data with increased accuracy and detail. The Maricopa Association of Governments conducted a survey utilizing Future Mobility Sensing (FMS) technology. One hundred percent of the sample was collected with the FMS technology platform that combines mobile sensing through a smartphone app with machine learning and a user interface. The technology enables detailed, multi-day, multimodal, user-verified travel and activity behavior data to be obtained with a reduced burden on participants. The data collected through the survey was analyzed together with a comparable dataset obtained through traditional recall-based collection methods during the same time period. The broad conclusions are that the 100% GPS-based surveys with the FMS technology platform provide greater accuracy, detail and completeness of data, as well as greater flexibility than traditional data collection approaches that rely on participant recall. Emphasis was made on comparative analyses between traditionally collected data and the GPS survey with the FMS technology. The paper systematically identifies and explains differences and provides original analyses that can inform future decision making relevant to similar data collection exercises. The method is particularly applicable for monitoring mobility in the ongoing conditions of rapidly changing travel behavior, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",0965-8564,Not found
Pricing curb parking,10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.012,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Where traffic is congested and all the curb spaces are occupied, some drivers are probably cruising for parking. Cities can eliminate this cruising by charging demand-based prices for curb parking to ensure one or two open spaces on every block. Drivers will then usually find convenient places to park within a short walk of their destinations. But if cities charge demand-based prices for curb parking, how will drivers choose where to park, and what will they pay? To answer these questions, I have examined how four variables—parking duration, number of persons in the car, walking speed, and value of saving time spent walking—determine parking choices when prices increase as drivers approach their destinations. Short-term parkers, carpools, slow walkers, and drivers with a high value of saving time will park closer to their destinations. Long-term parkers, solo drivers, fast walkers, and drivers with a low value of saving time will park farther away. This spontaneous, self-organizing pattern of parking choices responding to demand-based parking prices will minimize the collective cost of the time drivers spend walking to and from their destinations. Demand-priced curb parking will also reduce uncertainty about travel times. Drivers delayed by traffic congestion can save time at the end of their trips by paying a higher price to park closer to their destinations. Demand-priced curb parking at the end of a trip can serve as a buffer allowing late-arriving drivers to buy time when they need it most.",0965-8564,Not found
Psychological analysis of intercity bus passenger satisfaction using Q methodology,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.023,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"There is a significant decline in the number of intercity bus users in developing countries that makes company owners and service providers very concerned. Intercity bus service quality (BSQ) is significantly contributed to passenger satisfaction. Identification and improvement of the main criteria influencing the level of satisfaction are important to attract more passengers to public transport systems. In this regard, this paper aims to employ a Q-methodology to psychologically analyze the viewpoints of intercity bus passengers regarding the provided intercity BSQ. For this purpose, twenty-nine intercity bus users were surveyed based on the thirty-five statements. Finally, four distinct perspectives were derived that reflect the intercity bus passengers’ expectations. Perspectives A and B focused significantly on travel safety, travel time and terminal accessibility while perspectives C and D focused more on travel comfort.

Whether a good bus service can significantly reduce car use while increasing bus use is a confusing issue, hereto this study re-examines the interactions among bus service quality, car ownership, car use and bus use by constructing a SEM model. A sample of 334 individuals in Changzhou is used in the study. Results show that although high-quality bus service can cause a decrease in car use, the total negative effect of bus service quality on car use is far less than the positive effect of car ownership. Thus, when car ownership is growing rapidly, only a comprehensive and substantial improvement in bus service can alleviate and ultimately eliminate the enormous pressure on urban traffic resulted from the increasing car ownership. This study provides empirical evidence to explain why traffic congestion is still serious with the strong support in public transport from governments and gives policy implications on how to control urban traffic.",0965-8564,Not found
Paving the way for autonomous Vehicles: Understanding autonomous vehicle adoption and vehicle fuel choice under user heterogeneity,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.018,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Vehicle automation, along with vehicle electrification and shared mobility, may transform the existing transportation if they are handled properly. However, they may create unintended consequences if the current market dominance of fossil fuel and privately-owned vehicles persists, and travel patterns and transportation policies remain unchanged. The extent of these potential benefits and unintended consequences depends on the expected AV adoption process, people’s preferred vehicle powertrain, and AV-related policy and infrastructural support. This paper seeks to understand the impacts of attitudinal factors and roadway designs on people’s intention to use AVs and to purchase battery-electric AVs (EAVs) and gasoline-powered AVs (GAVs) under travel and user heterogeneity. Fourteen latent attitudinal factors related to the perceptions and attitudes towards AV and EV technologies, driving, the environment, and personal innovativeness were considered. An EAV-enabled urban design environments were created, featuring dedicated AV lanes, wireless charging for EAVs, and AV pick-up/drop-off zones. Using a stated preference survey data of over 1300 responses in the U.S., Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes models are estimated to understand the relationship among various latent variables and capture heterogeneities within the population based on their sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. The model estimation results show that the respondents’ perception of AVs and EAVs advantages, road safety improvement potential, compatibility with their lifestyles and travel needs, and their attitudes towards driving are key factors of their intention to use AVs and purchase EAVs. Furthermore, some segments of the population based on their sociodemographic and travel behavior characteristics are more likely to have a higher intention to use AVs and buy EAVs. The model estimation results and study insights can be used by policymakers to develop road network design guidelines and policies to nudge consumers towards more sustainable transportation options, minimize the unintended consequences of vehicle automation, and maximize its benefits.",0965-8564,Not found

The chief purpose of new regimes of street management is to expand spaces for walking and bicycling, and to ease business interactions such as curbside pickup and dining while maintaining social distancing guidelines. We investigated how North Americans on Twitter viewed alternative uses and forms of street reallocation, specifically during the early months of the pandemic from April 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020. Relying on a crowdsourced dataset of government actions (Combs and Pardo 2021), we identified five areas of policy initiative that were broadly representative of government actions: cycling, walking, driving, business, and curbside. First, we identified a corpus of 292,108 geolocated tweets from the U.S. and Canada. Next, we used word vectors, built on this Twitter corpus, to generate similarity scores across the five areas of policy initiative for each tweet. Finally, we selected the top tweets that closely matched ideas contained in the areas of policy initiative, thus creating a finer corpus of 1,537 tweets. Using the five categories as guideposts, we conducted an inductive content analysis to understand opinions expressed on Twitter. Our analysis suggests that renewed use of the curb has opened up possibilities for reimaging this space. Particularly, business uses of the curb for dining and pick up zones have expanded widely, and there is more use of sidewalks; yet both spaces have limited capacity. Planners need to think of expanding these assets while reducing cost burdens for their alternative uses.",0965-8564,Not found

Regulating the overloading of heavy commercial Vehicles: Assessment of land transport operators in Abu Dhabi,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.019,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"In March of 1986, the United Arab Emirates established a federal law to regulate heavy commercial vehicle's maximum weight limits, which was deactivated a few years after its implementation. As a result, the overloading rates by land transport operators (LTO) have increased over the years due to the lack of an effective regulatory framework. In the commuting system, an overload is defined as a load that exceeds the legal truckload limit and varies by the truck types specified by the number of axles. The overloaded heavy trucks negatively affect the road infrastructure by placing undue pressure on the road leading to severe damages. This research assesses the impact of overloaded heavy trucks in Abu Dhabi by conducting a trend analysis using Weigh-In-Motion data. Also, the study examines the behavior of these operators towards overloading using survey responses. The study contributes towards preserving the Emirate's road infrastructure and enhancing road user's safety and heavy truck operations. The results reveal 61% of trucks that passed through the weigh-in-motion stations were overloaded, and winter months reported the highest violations. Individual LTOs reported their perceived concerns about implementing the weight limit law and adapting to the law if implemented.

Adoption of delivery services in light of the COVID pandemic: Who and how long?,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.012,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"A significant growth in demand for online shopping in light of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID) crisis has received attention from transportation practitioners, policy-makers, and researchers. However, an important question arises in this increase in online shopping and resulting deliveries: How long will this last? Very little is known whether this popularity would last a long time. To address this question, the authors conducted a survey of 915 individuals residing in the U.S. and classified them into the four distinctive consumer types (i.e., the prior adopter, temporary adopter and permanent new adopter, and non-adopter) depending on their usage of delivery services before, during, and after (expected) the COVID crisis. This research aims to gain behavioral insight by exploring the differences between the four consumer types and investigating factors affecting the initial adoption and continuance intention of using delivery services. The descriptive analysis revealed that there are clear differences not only between the four types of consumers but also between the four product types (i.e., grocery, food, home goods, and other packages) considered in the survey.

Impacts of large-scale driverless truck adoption on the freight transport system,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.014,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This paper presents an analysis of the potential impacts of large-scale adoption of driverless trucks on transport patterns and system costs for a national freight transport system with Sweden as a case study. The analysis is performed by extending the application domain of the Swedish national freight transport model Samgods to analyze two types of driverless truck scenarios. The first scenario represents a full adoption of driverless trucks that can operate the complete road network and thereby substitute manually driven trucks. In this scenario, road transport tonne-kilometers on Swedish territory increase by 22%, vehicle kilometers traveled by trucks increase by 35% and annual total system costs decrease by 1.7 B€ compared to a baseline scenario without driverless trucks. In the second scenario, the current fleet of manually driven trucks is complemented by driverless trucks that can operate on major roads between logistics hubs, but not in complex traffic environments like urban areas due to a limited operational design domain. This may be an initial use-case for driverless trucks operating on public roads. In this scenario, road tonne-kilometers increase by 11%, truck vehicle kilometers traveled increase by 15%, and annual total system costs decrease by 1.2 B€ compared to the baseline. For both scenarios, the impacts of driverless trucks vary significantly between commodity types and transport distances which suggests heterogeneity of benefits of automated driving between different types of freight flows. A sensitivity analysis is performed in which the costs for driverless truck operations is varied, and for the second scenario, also which parts of the road network that driverless trucks can operate are varied. This analysis indicates that the magnitude of impacts is highly dependent on the cost level of driverless trucks and that the ability for DL-trucks to perform international, cross-border transport is crucial for achieving reductions in system costs. An overarching conclusion of the study is that driverless trucks may lead to a significant increase in road transport demand due to modal shifts from rail and sea as a result of the improved cost performance of road transport. This would further strengthen the need to decarbonize road transport to meet non-negotiable climate targets. Important topics for future research include assessing potential societal costs related to driverless trucks due to infrastructure investments and negative externalities such as increasing CO2 emissions and congestion.",0965-8564,Not found
The case for negotiated contracts under the transition to a green bus fleet,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.006,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Bus operators in the public and private sector are increasingly subject to competitive tendering in many countries and a requirement to operate under a gross cost contract. This contract sets out in detail the requirements of the operator, including the levels of service as well as infrastructure required to deliver the contracted services. Buses acquired by operators in many jurisdictions have until very recently been essentially diesel fuelled and often available from a panel approved set of buses compliant with Euro 6 standards. The predictability of the cost profiles of vehicles and associated costs of maintenance and repairs is well known and used in tendered offers. With the growing requirement of switching to a green fleet with varying timetabled transition rates, the future costs of providing bus services are going to be subject to significant unknowns. These unknowns are associated not only with the fast changing vehicle technology associated with a range of fuel sources (notably standard battery and fuel cell battery (i.e., hydrogen)), but also the impact this will have of the top-to-bottom change in the operations of bus fleets affecting operating and capital expenditure including depot infrastructure, timetabling, maintenance, labour skills and access to efficient electricity charging or hydrogen facilities. With such great uncertainty, the challenge of how to structure future contracts to allow for such volatility in cost commitments becomes of paramount importance to both the regulator and the bus operator. In this paper, we promote way forward to ensure that the transition to a totally green fleet is achieved without throwing the industry into chaotic uncertainty.",0965-8564,Not found

Although the challenges for women are more significant than those for men as they age, far less is known about the gender differences in mobility patterns of older adults, especially in the United States (US) context. This paper reports on a study that examined potential gender gaps in mobility patterns of older adults (aged 65 years and over) in the US by analyzing data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. Elderly respondents were first classified into one of six clusters based on socio-demographic variables. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) was then estimated and showed that gender gaps existed in the mobility patterns of the elderly, and the differences were diverse across the different clusters. The most substantial gender gap was found in the Senior Elder with Medical Condition(s) cluster, followed by the High-income Workers cluster and the Middle-income Urban Residents cluster. In contrast, females in the Low-Income Single Elder cluster enjoyed statistically significant positive mobility differences with their male counterparts. Our results also found that female elderly in the Senior Elder with Medical Condition(s) and the Low-income Family Elder clusters suffered most after the cessation of driving, with the largest mobility gender gap in the Middle-income Urban Resident cluster. This study will help transportation planners and policymakers understand gender and other socio-demographic differences in elderly mobility. Thus, it will facilitate the development of measures to improve elderly mobility and reduce gender gaps by recognizing and addressing specific target groups' mobility characteristics and needs rather than treating the elderly as a single potential user group.",0965-8564,Not found

The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological and contextual factors that associate with a switch from fossil fuel scooters to e-scooters. To model these factors, we conducted two studies in Taiwan. In Study 1, we elicited context-specific reasons for and against purchasing an e-scooter in a series of semi-structured interviews. In Study 2, we analyzed data from a survey among consumers (N = 320) using structural equation modelling. We consider the most important reasons from Study 1 together with environmental concerns (egoistic, altruistic, biospheric) in their relationship with intentions to switch to an e-scooter using the framework of Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT). In doing so, we provide unique insights for marketers and policymakers who seek to encourage the switch to this more sustainable form of mobility. We found environmental concerns among users of fossil-fueled scooters to be associated with attitude toward as well as reasons for and against switching to an e-scooter.

"Heterogeneous residential distribution changes and spillover effects by railway projects: The case study of Nagoya, Japan",10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.004,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This study aims to measure the causal relationship between three railway projects in different regions of Nagoya city and the residential distribution of different households. Rather than assuming that a railway project has an identical impact on all the neighborhoods in the treated group, this study proposes a heterogeneous difference-in-differences estimator to account for the heterogeneity in the treatment group, which is caused by different land cover characteristics. Specifically, the possible local spatial spillover effects are emphasized. The empirical application results indicate that (1) the northern neighborhoods near the Meijo and Aonami lines are attractive to households with higher income, (2) the southern neighborhoods near the Meijo line are appealing to middle-income households, (3) the low-income and old-single households prefer the southern neighborhoods along the Aonami line, and (4) the couple-with-children and old-couple households with lower income prefer to live around the Sakura-dori line. To conclude, railway-oriented communities, with different land use characteristics, attract different household types. This study’s findings have implications for policymakers, city planners, and scholars.",0965-8564,Not found
Effects of COVID-19 on rail passengers’ crowding perceptions,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.011,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Understanding changes in travel behavior during the spread of pandemic diseases such as COVID-19 is important to develop a resilient transportation system. Since one of the most important ways to prevent the spread of this virus is to keep a safe distance from other people (i.e. social distancing), it has implications for the operations of public transportation as compared to other modes of transportation due to the confinement of a large number of passengers in enclosed space. This study investigated the effect of the spread of COVID-19 on crowding perception and crowding disutility in metro rail system of Tehran. Two surveys were conducted before and during the COVID-19. The stated preference data were analyzed by mixed logit models with the lognormal distribution. Results revealed that the value of crowding increased during the pandemic. Tracking the changes of crowding perception caused by COVID-19 shows that low comfort scores were observed at crowding levels where seats were taken, and the density of standees was high (i.e. not possible to maintain social distancing). During the outbreak of COVID-19, crowding has more disutility for rail passengers and the value of having a seat while traveling increased. Understanding passengers’ perceptions of crowding as examined in this study will assist transport operators, and planners maintain the critical functionality of public transport systems and manage risks of mass transportation during the pandemic and beyond.",0965-8564,Not found
Factors influencing the usage of shared E-scooters in Chicago,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.008,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The rapid popularity growth of shared e-scooters creates the necessity of understanding the determinants of shared e-scooter usage. This paper estimates the impacts of temporal variables (weather data, weekday/weekend, and gasoline prices) and time-invariant variables (socio-demographic, built environment, and neighborhood characteristics) on the shared e-scooter demand by using four months (June 2019- October 2019) period of data from the shared e-scooter pilot program in Chicago. The study employs a random-effects negative binomial (RENB) model that effectively models shared e-scooter trip origin and destination count data with over-dispersion while capturing serial autocorrelation in the data. Results of temporal variables indicate that shared e-scooter demand is higher on days when the average temperature is higher, wind speed is lower, there is less precipitation (rain), weekly gasoline prices are higher, and during the weekend. Results related to time-invariant variables indicate that densely populated areas with higher median income, mixed land use, more parks and open spaces, public bike-sharing stations, higher parking rates, and fewer crime rates generate a higher number of e-scooter trips. Moreover, census tracts with a higher number of zero-car households and workers commuting by public transit generate more shared e-scooter trips. On the other hand, results reveal mixed relationships between shared e-scooter demand and public transportation supply variables. This study's findings will help planners and policymakers make decisions and policies related to shared e-scooter services.",0965-8564,Not found
Could psychosocial variables help assess pro-cycling policies?,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.003,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Although recent studies have recognised that psychosocial factors could affect the choice to bike to work, most have tended to focus only on the statistical significance of psychosocial variables, often making no attempt to analyse the magnitude of their effect before suggesting policy strategies based on these variables in too general a manner. Additionally, different studies have failed to distinguish between the choice to commute by bike and cycle for non-commuting purposes, mixing their results. Given the above discussion, the current studyaims at understandingand interpreting the relationship between the psychosocial factors related to bike use, commute mode choice and cycling for non-commuting purposes. To analyse the relationship among all these choice dimensions, we specified and estimated an integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model using a dataset drawn from a survey conducted in Sardinia (Italy). The model estimation highlights several very interesting aspects, some of which confirm the findings of previous studies, while others are new contributions to the literature. First, we find that the perception of the benefits of cycling and that of bike comfort positively influence the probability of using a bike for commuting and non-commuting purposes, albeit in different ways. Another important point is how modelling results can be employed to develop effective strategies for promoting cycling. We show that the implementation of structural measures aimed at reducing travel time may only be effective for commuters who travel more than 5 km, while the success of behavioural measures seems to be independent of distance. At the same time, by running different test scenarios, we indicate how to increase the efficacy of behavioural measures depending on the target population.",0965-8564,Not found
Who benefits from AVs? Equity implications of automated vehicles policies in full-scale prototype cities,10.1016/j.tra.2021.09.013,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"While researchers have stressed the potential of automated vehicle (AV) technology in improving mobility and accessibility for a range of people, only a few attempts have been made to examine the impact of this new technology on different segments of the population in a realistic setting using high-fidelity simulation. To fill this gap, we analyze the equity implications of Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) in three full-scale prototype cities using SimMobility, a state-of-the-art activity- and agent-based framework. The prototype cities were developed based on two auto-dependent typologies, representing cities largely in the US/Canada, and a dense transit-oriented typology. We perform equity analyses at the individual and income-group level, in order to reveal the winners and losers from the introduction of AVs under two scenarios: (1) AMoD Intro, in which a low-cost AMoD service competes with mass transit, and (2) AMoD Transit Integration, where AMoD complements mass transit, via access/egress connectivity service to rapid transit stations. We evaluate the following outcomes: induced demand by age and income groups, mode share by income levels, individual kilometers traveled by different modes and income levels, and the spatial distribution of change in fare and accessibility. Outcomes are considered as equity-oriented if they reduce accessibility gaps, particularly among disadvantaged populations. Our results indicate that in large population-dense and transit-oriented cities, the most equity-oriented outcomes can be achieved, due to extensive mass transit usage, which depresses car usage and restricts induced demand for AMoD. Such cities provide greater opportunities for low-income groups. Specifically, the AMoD Transit Integration scenario results in the best outcomes and implies a new market share, as disadvantaged groups, such as children and low-income individuals, were able to travel more using the integrated AMoD-transit service. Nevertheless, in car-dependent cities, where accessibility gaps are much larger, AMoD Intro scenario performs better compared to AMoD Transit Integration, as it serves the less accessible population and significantly improves their opportunities.",0965-8564,Not found
Exempting battery electric vehicles from traffic restrictions: Impacts on market and environment under Pigovian taxation,10.1016/j.tra.2021.09.014,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"In busy metropolitan areas, traffic restrictions based on the last digits of license plates effectively ease traffic jams and improve air quality.

To examine the impacts of such an exemption on consumers and manufacturers as well as the environment, this study models the duopoly competition between BEV and CV manufacturers as a Cournot game. The numerical analyses compare three traffic restriction policies concerning BEV and CV, and reveal the pros and cons of each. In particular, the BEV-exempted policy promotes customer adoption, industry development, and environment protection with the least consumer surplus loss. As supplementary measures, relevant vehicle purchase tax and carbon tax may make such a policy more effective, respectively, in short and long terms.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact of e-scooter sharing on bike sharing in Chicago,10.1016/j.tra.2021.09.012,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"As a new type of shared micromobility, e-scooter sharing first appeared in the United States and became popular worldwide. Considering e-scooter sharing and bike sharing have similar service attributes, the ridership of bike sharing may be affected by the introduction of e-scooter sharing. To date, studies exploring this impact are limited. In this study, we seek to analyze the impact of e-scooter sharing on the usage of bike sharing from trip data of e-scooter sharing and bike sharing in Chicago for a total of 30 weeks. We rely on a difference-in-differences modeling approach based on the propensity score matching method. We found that the average duration of e-scooter trips is shorter than that of bike trips. The introduction of e-scooter sharing reduced the overall bike sharing usage by 23.4 trips per week per station (10.2%). bike sharing usage of non-members and members decreased by 18.0 (34.1%) and 5.4 (4.0%) trips, and that of male and female members decreased by 3.3 (3.1%) and 2.0 (7.3%) trips, respectively. Furthermore, the volume of short-, medium-, and long-duration trips of bike sharing decreased by 10.9 (7.5%), 5.4 (9.6%), and 3.4 trips (20.5%), respectively. Finally, bike sharing use during non-peak hours decreased but was not affected during peak hours.",0965-8564,Not found

However, studies with a quick turnaround and also those that need to produce results suitable for implementation in existing forecasting systems often still rely on simpler approaches. This paper describes how state-of-the-art specifications can benefit such studies. We focus on the willingness of car and light van travellers in the Copenhagen area to pay to use a proposed new route which includes the new Harbour Tunnel (Havnetunnel) and completes the Copenhagen Eastern Ring Road. We adopt the very general framework from the most recent UK VTT study (Hess et al, 2017), and extend it to capture the correlation among different alternatives in the choice presentations (which reflected both route choice and time of day choice). We find extensive heterogeneity across travellers, both deterministic and random. A sample enumeration procedure was then set up to calculate average VTT values for use in forecasting demand and appraising the new Ring Road investment.",0965-8564,Not found
Interpretable data-driven demand modelling for on-demand transit services,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.001,154,2021-12-01,2021,12,"In recent years, with the advancements in information and communication technology, different emerging on-demand shared mobility services have been introduced as innovative solutions in the low-density areas, including on-demand transit (ODT), mobility on-demand (MOD) transit, and crowdsourced mobility services. However, due to their infancy, there is a strong need to understand and model the demand for these services. In this study, we developed trip production and distribution models for ODT services at Dissemination areas (DA) level using four machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Bagging, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The data used in the modelling process were acquired from Belleville’s ODT operational data and 2016 census data. Bayesian optimalization approach was used to find the optimal architecture of the adopted algorithms. Moreover, post-hoc model was employed to interpret the predictions and examine the importance of the explanatory variables. The results showed that the land-use type was the most important variable in the trip production model. On the other hand, the demographic characteristics of the trip destination were the most important variables in the trip distribution model. Moreover, the results revealed that higher trip distribution levels are expected between dissemination areas with commercial/industrial land-use type and dissemination areas with high-density residential land-use. Our findings suggest that the performance of ODT services can be further enhanced by (a) locating idle vehicles in the neighbourhoods with commercial/industrial land-use and (b) using the spatio-temporal demand models obtained in this work to continuously update the operating fleet size.",0965-8564,Not found
Refined choice set generation and the investigation of multi-criteria transit route choice behavior,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.005,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"To best make informed public transportation decisions, agencies must be aware of how individuals interact with the transit system. The key question to consider is how do passengers get from Point A to Point B and which attributes of the transit trip have the largest influence on that choice? To more accurately understand passengers’ interaction with transit systems, a new method for transit route choice estimation is proposed. This method modifies and builds upon a schedule-based forward label setting multi-criteria shortest path algorithm by introducing an iterative trip elimination methodology. This new methodology yields high quality transit path choice sets with exact regeneration of 70.5% of the observed paths. Moreover, detailed temporal information on all types of network links (in-vehicle, walking, and waiting) are produced with reasonable computational time of 0.5 s per path calculation and 6.9 s per individual’s choice set generation. This increased specificity, in turn, heightens the validity and accuracy of the route choice model. Passenger information is sampled from a transit on-board survey containing origin–destination locations, demographic details, and trip-specific attributes. A multinomial logit model with stop-level path size correction term is estimated. This estimation yields a 67% recovery rate between the path with the highest estimated likelihood and the surveyed (taken) transit path. Furthermore, a transfer penalty of 28.8 min was estimated while the marginal rates of substitution for the waiting and walking time coefficients are in close alignment with similar values in the literature. Express bus routes were found to have a statistically significant negative impact on path utility for the lowest income thresholds while transitways (light rail, bus rapid transit, or commuter rail) had a positive associated perception for the highest household income class. Thus, support is found for the claim that transitways can potentially attract higher-income “choice” riders to the transit network. The results of this research can be used to improve ridership projections and highlight areas for policy improvements that could have the largest impact on retaining and attracting new passengers to the transit system.",0965-8564,Not found
Towards sustainable transport in developing countries: Preliminary findings on the demand for mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) in Metro Manila,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.024,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a recent concept that is gaining momentum in both the scientific world and the private sector. First studies and field trials – essentially conducted in developed countries – suggest that MaaS can influence people’s mobility behavior and create more efficient and sustainable transport systems for the future. We intend to contribute to the existing knowledge about MaaS by extending the scope to the context of developing countries where MaaS could be a potential strategy to address existing transport problems. Our case study focuses on Metro Manila (Philippines), an emerging Asian megacity. We analyzed its citizens’ (N = 238) readiness for and attitude towards MaaS, and how a MaaS-system could influence users’ mobility behavior. Considering mobility-related and socio-demographic characteristics, our statistical models give preliminary insights about the potential MaaS users and how a MaaS system would create value for them. While the vast majority (84%) of respondents stated they were likely to use a MaaS app, the main reasons for adoption appear to be reliability and cost savings. In addition, we found evidence that MaaS could shift users’ mobility behavior towards more sustainable transport modes (i.e., from private and low-capacity modes towards public transport). Policy implications and future research paths for MaaS in developing countries are also discussed. Considering the novelty and complexity of this research area, we call for additional research in this field.",0965-8564,Not found
Traffic flow at signalized intersections with large volumes of bicycle traffic,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.021,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The popularity of utilitarian bicycling is increasing in many urban areas. As a result, growing volumes of bicycle traffic on road networks have significant impacts on traffic flow and the capacity of vehicular traffic, particularly at intersections. The goal of this paper is to quantify the impact of large volumes of bicycle traffic on the capacity of signalized intersections concerning vehicular streams crossing the intersection, turning right, and turning left. Empirical studies are conducted to gain insight into the speed, acceleration, queue density, queue discharge, and conflict zone occupancy time of bicycle traffic. Data were collected at sites with varying infrastructure designs and bicycle traffic volumes. The results of the empirical studies are used to assess the effects of bicycle infrastructure on traffic efficiency and build, calibrate, and validate microscopic traffic simulation models. The bicycle traffic volume is incrementally increased in the simulation models to supplement the data from the empirical studies. Based on the empirical findings and simulation results, the average queue discharge time per bicyclist based on the facility width is derived and two factors for the reduction in the capacity of vehicular traffic turning left and turning right based on the actual green time ratio and the volume of crossing bicycle traffic are proposed. If a bike box is present on an intersection approach, findings show that crossing bicycle traffic has a negligible effect on the capacity of crossing vehicular traffic, which bicyclists turning left impede vehicular traffic.",0965-8564,Not found
The dynamic and long-term changes of automated bus service adoption,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.021,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Integrating automated buses (ABs) into the public transport system may have potentials of providing more environment-friendly and cost-efficient mobility solutions by improving travel safety, reducing cost and decreasing congestion. However, the realization of the potentials depends not only on innovative technologies but also on users’ acceptance of the ABs service. Whilst there has been a number of studies exploring the acceptance and adoption of ABs services, hardly any longitudinal studies have analyzed the long-term changes of individuals’ behavior in adopting AB services. This paper aims to add knowledge on user acceptance of ABs in public transport based on empirical evidence in a real-life deployment context. Three waves of surveys that investigated users’ travel attitudes and behaviors towards the automated bus were conducted at three different time points (six months, 11 months, and 14 months after the launch). The relationship between socio-demographic variables, travel experience variables, and attitude variables is modeled using structural equation modelling (SEM). Factors that influence experienced users to continue using the service were found to dynamically change over time. Initially, people were attracted to use the service if they perceived the information of the service to be sufficient, but they were demotivated to continue using the service if the comfort was worse, frequency was lower, or travel time was longer than expected. The results show that previous experience of adopting the ABs has impacts on different attitude variables. In order to promote individuals’ continued use of ABs, the public transport authorities and operators should work closely to increase the frequency of the services. It is also necessary to enhance the comfort of the ABs.",0965-8564,Not found
Factors influencing the intention to use electric cars in Brazil,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.018,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Electric cars have been gaining ground on the world market in recent years. In Brazil, the presence of this new technology is still nascent and few studies on the subject are found in the literature, especially in terms of consumer perspectives. This research aimed to identify the determining factors for the Intention to Use electric cars in Brazil, adopting a research model based on the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior and the influence of consumer emotions. Data was collected from an online survey of 488 Brazilian respondents and analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling technique. The results reveal that a perceived relative advantage and a perceived compatibility associated with the use of the electric car have a positive effect on the attitudes of the respondents, and that positive attitudes towards the electric car have, in turn, a positive effect on the Intention to Use the same. Attitudes towards the electric car and the influence of emotions were identified as the biggest predictors of Intention to Use. The results also indicate that, despite the positive inclination of respondents in relation to using and even buying an electric car, there is still much concern about the charging infrastructure, charging time and vehicle autonomy, in addition to other barriers, such as the purchase price. These findings are in line with the results of several studies of the same scope, carried out in other countries. The results of the present study may shed light on the discussion of the topic in Brazil, in addition to providing stakeholders in electromobility in the country with information that benefits the development of policies and guidelines for the spread of electric car use in Brazil.",0965-8564,Not found

Surveys probing people’s qualitative perceptions about bicycling environments can inform bicycle planning in important ways. In this study we use survey data from an on-line video experiment to analyze bicycling comfort and its relationship with person-level and road-level variables. We use an existing survey of students, faculty, and staff at UC Davis (n = 3089) who rated video clips of bicycling facilities in different environments based on their perceived comfort as a part of the annual UC Davis Campus Travel Survey (CTS). The video clips come from a variety of urban and semi-rural roads around the San Francisco Bay Area where bicycling rates vary. Our results indicate considerable effects of socio-demographics and attitudes on absolute video ratings, but we find relative agreement about which videos are most comfortable and uncomfortable across our sample population segments. Presence of bike infrastructure and low speed roads are especially important in generating higher comfort ratings. However, our results suggest that even the best designed on-road bike facilities (according to attributes in our data) are unlikely to provide a comfortable bicycling environment for those without a predisposition to bicycle. Nonetheless, our results provide guidance for improving roads with on-street bike facilities where protected or separated facilities may not be suitable. We discuss these results in the context of design standards for bicycling and methods for prioritizing bike infrastructure investments.",0965-8564,Not found

Thereby, this paper increases the understanding of the preconditions that lead to wide-spread acceptance of transport innovations. An analysis of the psychological set-up of the respondents allowed for the identification of a group of enthusiasts that are excited to try out these new transportation offerings.

Yet, navigation in the Arctic implies facing harsh sailing conditions. To prevent risk arising from this singular region, the IMO Polar Code imposes mandatory tools as the Polar Ship Certificate and suggests others such as POLARIS. At the crossroads of container and tramp market, scholars have paid little attention to the transportation of heavy cargo. The objective of this research is to assess the impact of the Polar Code policy framework and its tools on the management of a highly strategic project. To do so, we shall rely on the case of the transport and assembly of the Yamal LNG plant modules. Yamal LNG started its production in late 2019 and has already produced 19 million tons per year. The paper contemplates a ship routing and scheduling optimization model that considers different fleet types and ice conditions and applies the POLARIS Risk Index Outcome (RIO) in Arctic waters. Even though the modules are required on site in summer, due to the extreme weather conditions and limited accessibility in winter, our results highlight that the use of Polar Class vessels allowing year-round navigation in Arctic waters is critical to ensure the success of such projects. Indeed, Polar Class 3 vessels, as ships with the greatest possible “polarseaworthiness”, are capable of significantly reducing delays in project’s completion.

Past studies have identified both advantages and disadvantages of teleworking. The pandemic experience offers a unique opportunity to examine employees’ experiences and perceptions of telework given the broad participation duration and extent. While employer strategies will play a major role in defining the future forms and adoption of telework, employee preferences and constraints, such as access to appropriate technology to work from home or the home environment, are also going to be important factors. Using data from a U.S. representative sample of 318 working adults, this study uses a Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause Model (MIMIC) to understand employee satisfaction with telework. The presented model links telework satisfaction with experienced and perceived benefits and barriers related to telework, and hence provide a causal structure to our understanding of telework satisfaction. We also present an ordered probit model without latent variables that help us understand the systematic heterogeneity in telework satisfaction across various socio-demographic groups. The results suggest younger and older aged individuals experienced/perceived lower benefits and higher barriers to teleworking compared to middle aged individuals. The results also suggest a disproportionate impact on Hispanic or Latino and Black respondents as well as on those with children attending online school from home. Accordingly, this study highlights important factors impacting telework adoption that employers and policy makers should consider in planning future work arrangements and policies in a post-pandemic world.",0965-8564,Not found
Does rail transit development gentrify neighborhoods? Evidence from Hong Kong,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.022,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Transit-induced gentrification is a popular topic of research and a pressing concern worldwide. However, little attention is paid to the connection between rail transit development and the movement of low-income residents. To investigate this important issue, this paper studies the development of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) in Hong Kong between 2001 and 2006, which added three new rail transit lines covering a total length of 65 km. By using census statistics at the district council constituency area (DCCA) level in a difference-in-differences approach, we find that MTR development in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2004 increased the number of advanced degree holders (Bachelor’s degree and above) by 10% in the New Territories and 7.81% in the new towns and reduced the number of low-income households by 5.85% in the New Territories and 7.53% in the new towns. To confirm that these socioeconomic changes were driven by internal migration, we further use household-level data from the 5% population censuses in 2001 and 2006 in a multinomial logistic regression. The results indicate that MTR development between 2002 and 2004 was likely to induce high-educated people to move into and low-income households to move out of MTR-served areas. The results show that the New Territories and the new towns in Hong Kong underwent gentrification between 2001 and 2006. We therefore suggest that the Hong Kong government negotiate with MTR Corporation to allocate resources to develop properties for low-income families.",0965-8564,Not found

Through a set of difference-in-differences regressions, we found that agglomeration economies and HSR access each play an important role in determining the spatial pattern of the birth of new firms. Overall, the number of new firms declined significantly in counties with HSR access. However, the average effect masks significant heterogeneity with respect to industry type and geographic location. More firms in the service sector cluster in urban districts due to HSR, while firms in the primary and manufacturing sectors move out to locations without HSR access. Among four Chinese regions, central China attracts the most firms, while the underdeveloped western and northeastern regions are less successful. These results suggest that the development of an HSR network increases regional inequality. We show that people find districts with HSR attractive, which boosts the demand within the service sector. However, population concentration can raise land cost, as the primary and manufacturing sectors are crowded out to other, less expensive locations. This study demonstrates that a grasp of firm movement patterns is critical to understanding how HSR reshapes the spatial distribution of economic activities.",0965-8564,Not found
Preferences for roundabout attributes among US bicyclists: A discrete choice experiment,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.023,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"As roundabouts become increasingly common, there is very limited research about bicycle safety at roundabouts and, specifically, a lack of information about preferences for roundabouts among people bicycling. To address this gap, we conducted a discrete choice experiment involving an online survey of 613 US adult bicyclists to understand stated preferences for roundabouts with different design and operational characteristics: central island size, number of circulating lanes, bicycle facility type, motor vehicle volumes, and approach speed limit. For each respondent, the experiment included six (from among 18) choices between two roundabouts with different attributes, represented using text and simulated images. We analyzed these data using panel mixed multinomial logit models with random and systematic preference heterogeneity due to respondent characteristics. Overall, US bicyclists seem to prefer roundabouts with: smaller central islands, fewer travel lanes, lower traffic volumes, lower speed limits, and separated bicycle lanes; although, shared lane bicycle markings and signs were also preferred over bicycle ramps to the sidewalk or no bicycle facilities. Additionally, there were significant variations in preferences for bicycle facilities at roundabouts. Women, infrequent cyclists, and “interested but concerned” cyclists had stronger preferences for separated bicycle lanes, but “strong and fearless” and/or “enthused and confident” cyclists had significantly weaker preferences for these more protected facilities. This research offers insights into bicycling preferences that may help to create roundabouts that are safer and more attractive for people bicycling of all ages and abilities.",0965-8564,Not found
CHAIRS: A choice-based air transport simulator applied to airline competition and revenue management,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.010,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"In Revenue Management (RM) systems, information censoring and the interaction between the forecasting and optimization stages, increases the costs and complexity of performance analysis using historical data. An affordable and suitable alternative is using simulations, but appropriate behavioral models must be considered. In the following document, we discuss and test the implementation of a dynamic air transport market simulator, designed to analyze RM systems. The simulator replicates the behavior of passengers that book seats offered in multiple flights by different airlines. We use discrete choice models to replicate the demand behavior, accounting for preferences and decision rule heterogeneity, and including a temporal evolution of the preference throughout the selling horizon. To replicate the supply behavior, a number of airlines modify the price and quantity of different fare classes offered in each flight, using a variety of RM forecasting, un-constraining, and optimization techniques. The simulator allows analysts to study the economic benefit of RM systems under predefined assumptions in an artificial and controlled environment. This increases the benefits obtained by the correct selection of context-appropriate RM systems and the likelihood of successfully implementing new and complex systems. We test and showcase the simulator performance, studying the entrance of a new airline in a competitive context. We generate, implement and evaluate different RM strategies in response to the introduction of new competition, and discuss the results, highlighting the interpretability and accuracy of the proposed framework.",0965-8564,Not found
Modeling travel choice behavior with the concept of image: A case study of college students’ choice of homecoming train trips during the Spring Festival travel rush in China,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.019,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"This study aims to investigate individuals’ travel choice behavior with the concept of image, which indicates an individual’s perceived reflection of an external object in his/her mind. To this end, college students’ choice of homecoming train trips during the Spring Festival travel rush in China was applied as a case study, in which college students’ perceived image toward high-speed rail was taken into consideration. Specifically, various dimensions of image toward high-speed rail, i.e., stability, safety, speed, comfort, punctuality, food, facility, and staff, were considered. In addition, a stated choice experiment was designed, in which four hypothetical train trips (two conventional and two high-speed train trips) consisted of a choice set. An online survey was carried out, where 2768 valid observations from 346 respondents were collected. Based on the collected data, exploratory factor analysis was first implemented to reduce the dimensionality of perceived image and also to define a set of latent image factors. Then a hybrid choice model was established and estimated. Besides college students’ preferences toward determinants involved in the experiment design, the results did confirm significant effect of perceived image in the travel choice behavior.",0965-8564,Not found
"Examining non-linear associations between built environments around workplace and adults’ walking behaviour in Shanghai, China",10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.017,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Considering that most working adults spend nearly half their waking time at work, creating a supportive built environment around workplaces could be a feasible approach to maintain adequate levels of physical activity. However, the extent to which the built environment around workplaces influences walking behaviors in working adults remains unclear. Using survey data of 1009 full-time employees in Shanghai, China, this study assessed the nonlinear relationships between the built environment characteristics around workplaces and three domains of walking behaviors (commuting, utilitarian, and recreational walking). Using gradient boosting decision trees, our results showed that the built environment around workplaces is crucial for higher levels of walking behaviors, but built environment features tended to have distinctive associations with different domains of walking behaviors. Specifically, the number of physical activity facilities was positively associated with all three domains of walking behaviors, while a high floor area ratio was negatively associated with different domains of walking behaviors to some extent. Furthermore, several built environment characteristics, such as land use entropy, street view greenery, distance from home to the city center, and distance between the city center and workplaces had distinctive associations with different domains of walking behaviors. The findings of this study could provide nuanced guidance for creating pedestrian-friendly environments around workplaces to promote walking behaviors and overall physical activity levels in the working population.",0965-8564,Not found
"An ex-post evaluation of the public acceptance of a license plate-based restriction policy: A case study of Xi'an, China",10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.024,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Over the last decade, there has been a steady increase in the number of cities in China and around the world adopting License Plate-based Restriction (LPR) policies, whereby vehicles are permitted to enter a defined road or area on the basis of a specific digit on the registration, license or number plate, to help mitigate traffic congestion and its associated impacts. Although the costs and benefits of implementing a LPR policy have been recognized, the public acceptance of a LPR policy has been less well studied. To better understand the factors affecting the public acceptance of a LPR policy, we improved the theoretical model by adding two factors related to attitude and new supposed deeper level effects between different factors. Accordingly, the theoretical model on exploring the factors affecting the public acceptance of such a scheme were explored in a questionnaire completed by 619 local residents in Xi’an, China and analyzed using a partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM). In addition, we carried out heterogeneity analysis to compare the differences between residents with various socio-economic attributes in factors with respect to affecting the acceptance of a LPR policy. The results show that problem perception, perceived effectiveness, perceived value and social norms exert a significant direct and indirect impact on the acceptance of a LPR policy. Important aims to reach can only indirectly affect the acceptance of a LPR policy by perceived effectiveness and perceived value, while policy cognition, attribution of responsibility have no significant influence on the acceptance of a LPR policy. Important aims and perceived effectiveness directly and direct affect the acceptance of a LPR policy by residents who are young, high-income and car-owning. The findings of this study can assist policy makers to design a more acceptable policy to further mitigate congestion situations.",0965-8564,Not found
Autonomous vehicle parking policies: A case study of the City of Toronto,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.003,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) can eliminate the burden of finding a parking spot upon arrival to the destination. AVs can park at a strategic location or cruise until summoned by their users. In this study, we investigate AV users’ parking decision considering their cost and time constraints. Each users’ decision has impacts on congestion which can change feasible options of other users. Hence, we use an agent-based simulation model to study AV parking policies. Results show that travelers consider sending their vehicles to park at home if they have to pay to use a parking facility. Also, our analysis for downtown Toronto shows that AVs would travel on average 12 min and a maximum of 47 min to park in cheaper parking lots. We also find that assigning the same parking price across all the parking facilities would exacerbate the congestion by motiving more AVs to cruise instead of choosing the closest parking lot. However, we show that a toll for zero-occupant AVs leads to a tradeoff between parking cost and distance that would decrease the VKT by 3.5% in downtown Toronto.",0965-8564,Not found
Waiting time and headway modeling considering unreliability in transit service,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.015,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Waiting cost is usually considered as the highest cost imposed to passengers in transit systems. Efficient planning and operations of transit systems require accurate estimation of passengers’ waiting time. While the assumption of half the headway, as the mean waiting time experienced by transit users, has been extensively used in waiting time cost estimation, it is not always a realistic assumption considering heterogeneous passengers, service irregularities, and different types of transit services. In addition, many transit studies considered the waiting times of passengers only at the origin, while waiting times can also be incurred at transfer points and the destination, the latter for passengers with fixed arrival time at their destination. In this paper, we developed new mean waiting time formulations for different transit systems, including feeder-trunk service, Dial-a-Ride service, and single route with unreliable service. All possible combinations of types of passenger (planning and non-planning, with fixed and flexible arrival time at destination) and service types (schedule-based/frequency-based and high-frequency/low-frequency) are considered to capture the underlying dynamics of transit systems. The developed approach in this paper could be utilised in transit studies to better model these underlying dynamics and to achieve better designs and more efficient operations.",0965-8564,Not found
How do constrained car ownership and car use influence travel and life satisfaction?,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.014,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Promoting subjective well-being is an important goal in urban policy. Transportation scholars increasingly evaluate transportation systems based on people’s subjective well-being. This study joins this strand of efforts to answer the following research question: how do constrained car ownership and car use influence travel and life satisfaction? Empirical data were collected in Beijing where various policies had been implemented to curb the rapid growth of car ownership and mitigate traffic congestion. We answer the question by examining the effects of car ownership and car usage variables on travel and life satisfaction. Our study shows that owning multiple cars increases vehicle users’ life satisfaction, but owning a car is not related to increased life satisfaction. Purchasing a more expensive car and driving cars more frequently in daily life could not increase people’s life satisfaction, but infrequent car use contributes to higher travel and life satisfaction. Among vehicle users, using cars to commute is related to higher travel satisfaction but not higher life satisfaction. In contrast, using cars for non-work trips is related to higher life satisfaction but not travel satisfaction. We also find that attitudes towards the instrumental and affective roles of cars are positively related to travel and life satisfaction among car owners. Results of this paper suggest the importance of promoting sustainable transportation and behavioral education in cities like Beijing.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of working from home on modal commuting choice response during COVID-19: Implications for two metropolitan areas in Australia,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.011,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The need to recognise and account for the influence of working from home on commuting activity has never been so real as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only does this change the performance of the transport network, it also means that the way in which transport modellers and planners use models estimated on a typical weekday of travel and expand it up to the week and the year must be questioned and appropriately revised to adjust for the quantum of working from home. Although teleworking is not a new phenomenon, what is new is the ferocity by which it has been imposed on individuals throughout the world, and the expectation that working from home is no longer a temporary phenomenon but one that is likely to continue to some non-marginal extent given its acceptance and revealed preferences from both many employees and employ where working from home makes good sense. This paper formalises the relationship between working from home and commuting by day of the week and time of day for two large metropolitan areas in Australia, Brisbane and Sydney, using a mixed logit choice model, identifying the influences on such choices together with a mapping model between the probability of working from home and socioeconomic and other contextual influences that are commonly used in strategic transport models to predict demand for various modes by location. The findings, based on Wave 3 (approximately 6 months from the initial outbreak of the pandemic) of an ongoing data collection exercise, provide the first formal evidence for Australia in enabling transport planners to adjust their predicted modal shares and overall modal travel activity for the presence of working from home.",0965-8564,Not found
Ridesourcing vs. traditional taxi services: Understanding users’ choices and preferences in Spain,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.002,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Both the traditional taxi and ridesourcing market provide similar on-demand door-to-door transportation services from the users’ viewpoint, although operate under different legal and regulatory frameworks. Ridesourcing has experienced notable growth in urban mobility in the last few years since it gives a convenient, on-demand door-to-door service, provides app-based real-time information about the trip, and offers flexible prices that vary according to the level of supply and demand at each moment. This new actor in urban mobility directly competes with taxis, a more regulated mode that has traditionally provided door-to-door trips. While competition between taxi and ridesourcing has generated great controversy in the public debate, little attention has been paid to the users’ viewpoint. Additionally, most of the scientific literature on travel behavior and ridesourcing focus on specific characteristics of these services, while scarce efforts have been devoted to study users’ choices and preferences towards ridesourcing vs. its main competitor, taxi services. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates the main factors (individual sociodemographic, mobility-related characteristics, psychological attitudes, etc.) determining individuals’ choices between ridesourcing and traditional taxis. To that end, a Generalized Structural Equation Model (GSEM) is carried out, based on the information collected from a survey campaign conducted in Spain. The results show that, from a behavioral perspective, people opened to technological innovation and with liberal thought (in the sense of being favorable to market openness) tend to use ridesourcing services more often than taxis. Our results also suggest a higher tendency to use ridesourcing among women, young people, and people using hailing services for leisure, recreational or social purposes. Interestingly, individuals having already used both taxi and ridesourcing in Spain, tend to rate higher the quality-of-service performance (driver and/or vehicle fleet) provided by ridesourcing compared to taxis.",0965-8564,Not found

With the ERP rates reviewed quarterly and adjusted for the relevant 30-min periods based on speeds criteria, the volume of data collected through the years has enabled a closer look at how motorists behave with rate increases or decreases, and how these travel behaviors compare with the established consumer behavior phenomenon of loss aversions and the theory of diminished sensitivity. This paper studied 33 rate changes across 6 expressway ERP pricing gantries between the years of 2012 and 2018, and derived precise observations of travel behavior changes. The data showed that frequent car drivers tend to make more deliberate choices on whether to leave or stay on their routes. Frequent car drivers are defined as those who drive past that gantry at least 60% of the weekdays in that month (proportionally around 3 weekdays per week). We also affirmed that loss aversion theory is exhibited in road pricing through the higher demand elasticities observed from $1 rate increases as compared to the $1 rate reductions. Interestingly however, the theory of diminishing sensitivity did not seem to drive traveler’s decisions here. Instead, Singapore drivers appeared to have assessed their trip decisions based on two reference points during rate increases; a primary reference point of $2 and a reasonable reference point of $5.",0965-8564,Not found
Spatiotemporally complementary effect of high-speed rail network on robustness of aviation network,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.020,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Although previous studies explored the relationship between high-speed rail (HSR) and civil aviation, most of them focus on the negative effects of HSR on civil aviation, including the competition between them. However, studies exploring the positive effects of HSR on civil aviation remain limited. This study demonstrates that a high-speed rail network (HSRN) has a spatiotemporally complementary effect (CE) on the robustness of aviation networks (ANs) against different types of hazards. First, we describe the AN as a multiple weighted network with the CE of HSRN based on the operating routes of flights and trains, instead of an independent network. Then, a novel framework for assessing the robustness of AN is developed considering travel time and service frequency as its metrics and considering the coverage distance of the CE. We find that the CE can obviously reduce the loss of the AN’s performance under various disaster scenarios by analyzing the robustness of the AN of Mainland China complemented by HSRN; different levels of CE have different effects on the robustness of AN. Besides the airports located in Eastern China, some non-hub airports such as Changzhou, Wuxi, and Shaorao, are easily complemented by the HSRN. Further, the CE at different times exerts different effects on the robustness of AN, which reach a peak at 16:00 and 07:00. These findings can help broaden the ideas and approaches for enhancing the robustness of the AN.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of COVID-19 on the ride-sharing industry and its recovery: Causal evidence from China,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.005,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruptions to many industries, and the transportation industry is among the most disrupted ones. We seek to address, in the context of a ride-sharing platform, the response of drivers to the pandemic and the post-pandemic recovery. We collected comprehensive trip data from one of the leading ride-sharing companies in China from September 2019 to August 2020, which cover pre-, during-, and post-pandemic phases in three major Chinese cities, and investigate the causal effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on driver behavior. We find that drivers only slightly reduce their number of shifts in response to increased COVID-19 cases, likely because they have to make a living from providing ride-sharing services. Nevertheless, conditional on working, drivers exhibit strong risk aversion: As the number of new cases increases, drivers strategically adjust the scope of their search for passengers, complete fewer trips, and as a result, make lower daily earnings. Finally, our heterogeneity analyses indicate that the effects appear to vary both across drivers and over time, with generally stronger effects on drivers who are older, more experienced, more active before the pandemic, and higher-status within the firm. Our findings have strong policy implications: These drivers tend to contribute more to the focal company, and also rely more on providing ride-sharing services to make a living. Therefore, they should be prioritized in stimulus plans offered by the government or the ride-sharing company.",0965-8564,Not found
Public transportation and fear of crime at BRT Systems: Approaching to the case of Barranquilla (Colombia) through integrated choice and latent variable models,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.001,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Security perception and Fear of Crime (FoC) in urban scenarios have the potential to affect travel behavior, changing people’s travel choices and patterns. In this sense, the feeling of being “safe” or “at-risk” in public transportation not only depends on observable factors like illumination, travel companionship or transport crowding, but also on unobservable individual-specific latent attributes, among which fear of crime constitutes a major issue to consider in transport security policy-making. This study aimed to describe the relationships among sociodemographic features, travel situations, system-design features, and the Fear of Crime at three different locations (buses, bus stops, and stations) of the BRT system of Barranquilla (Colombia). Using an image-based survey applied in Barranquilla, data was collected from a full-sample of 500 adult users (64% females and 36% males) of the system. It was estimated a hybrid choice model to include location-based fear of crime in public transportation perception of risk, along with attributes related to (e.g.) surveillance, crowding, time of the day, and companionship. The relation between fear of crime and perception of security in public transportation is negative and highly significant. FoC inside the bus has the highest negative effect on the utility, followed by bus stops and BRT Stations, for which it remains non-significant. Gender (being a female user) was the strongest FoC predictor. Moreover, it was found that the higher is the user’s income, the lower is the fear of crime reported for each one of these three types of location. Overall, the inclusion of the fear of crime perception in the estimation of the hybrid choice model enhances the model fit. Also, the user-related findings of this study at different locations provide a better understanding of the decision-making process and the predictors of fear of crime in BRT systems.",0965-8564,Not found
Shaping inclusiveness of a transportation system: Factors affecting seat-yielding behavior of university students in public transportation,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.004,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The continuous increase in the elderly population and the need for disability-inclusive public transportation propelled authorities to implement policies to ensure seat availability for vulnerable users. Although most public transportation provides a few priority seats for vulnerable users, the seat availability problem remains due to its small quantity and its usage by normal passengers. To extend the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study aims to evaluate how empathic concerns, attitude, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, and perceived behavioral control contribute to the behavioral intentions and actual conducts of yielding seats to vulnerable passengers with university students’ survey responses in China. A partial least square path modeling based structural equation modeling (SEM) approach is employed to test the postulated hypotheses. Findings reveal that empathic concerns significantly promote the yielding seat intention and, thus, the actual conduct through its impacts on attitude, injunctive norms, and perceived behavioral control. This study also aims at capturing sociodemographic heterogeneity through multi-group comparison. It is found that a university student passenger who is older or more educated perceives greater control about seat yielding behavior, positively influencing their intention to yield their seat to a vulnerable person. In addition, less frequent public transportation usage is found to significantly accompany a higher tendency to yield a seat when required. The implications of “soft measures” to support the transportation policy for a sustainable and disability-inclusive public transportation service are discussed accordingly.",0965-8564,Not found
How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the use of ride-sourcing services? An empirical evidence-based investigation for the Greater Toronto Area,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.013,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the nature of day-to-day life in cities worldwide. In the transportation sector, COVID-19 appears to have impacted modal preferences. In particular, people seem to be less willing to use modes where they may encounter strangers (such as public transit) and modes that involve coming into contact with shared surfaces (such as ride-sourcing). Given the transformative impact that ride-sourcing services had on urban mobility before the pandemic, it is crucial to understand the effects of COVID-19 on the use of ride-sourcing moving forward. Using data from a web-based survey, this study combines descriptive analysis with the application of a two-stage ordered logit model framework to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on the utilization of ride-sourcing services in the Greater Toronto Area, including how often ride-sourcing is used and the earliest stage of the pandemic that a person would consider using ride-sourcing. Generally speaking, the use of ride-sourcing has decreased since the start of the pandemic, however, there are also people who are using ride-sourcing more often than they did before the pandemic. The results indicate that the perception of risk, the tendency to take precautions when leaving home, and socio-economic factors influence the earliest stage of the pandemic where a person would consider using ride-sourcing. Overall, it appears that ride-sourcing usage will gradually increase as restrictions are lifted; however, it is unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels until COVID-19 is no longer considered a public health threat.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper examines the causal impact of a tech-enhanced bikeshare program on public transit ridership, using evidence from a mid-sized metropolitan area in the Midwest of the United States. We use a difference-in-differences identification, exploring the exogenous hourly variation in precipitation and the fact that bicycle usage is limited when precipitation occurs. We find that the initial pedal bicycle fleet with a dockless system increased bus ridership by 1% and the subsequent upgrades to electric bikes further increased bus ridership by an additional 1.1%. The increased bus ridership occurred where and when the travel demand arose, providing suggestive evidence of bikeshare trips solving the first-/last-mile problem. The increased bus ridership occurred mostly in block groups with a lower median household income, a younger population, lower vehicle ownership rate, and lower homeownership rate.",0965-8564,Not found
Purchase intention and actual purchase of cargo cycles: Influencing factors and policy insights,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.007,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"To support the penetration of cargo cycles in commercial transport, this research aims at identifying the significant influencing factors for their purchase, using data from Europe’s largest cargo cycle testing project “Ich entlaste Städte”. This is achieved by developing binary logit models for the intention to purchase (stated at the end of a 3-month vehicle trial), and the actual purchase decision made (queried three months or later, after the end of the trial). Prior to the estimation of the logit models, latent variables have been constructed using explanatory factor analysis. Based on the estimation results, factors that influence the actual purchase decision include catchment area of cargo cycle trips, daily usage during the trial phase, trial phase season, type of cargo cycle tested, mode substituted by cargo cycles during the trial phase and business sector. Furthermore, four other factors, which are latent variables constructed through exploratory factor analysis, are found to have significant influence: perception of operational, soft and cost benefits, as well as importance of deterioration of conditions for conventional vehicles. Based on the influence of these factors, policy measures are suggested under the following categories: (i) Regulation, (ii) Infrastructure, (iii) Finance, (iv) Campaigns and (v) Trial schemes. The data from the project shows the existence of a difference between the intention and the actual purchase decision (around 50% higher intent compared to realized purchase). This implies that there is a need to convert intention to actual decision, when making conclusions based on intention. A comparison, made between the binary logit models of intention and actual purchase decision, brings out the reality that the latter is influenced by hard facts like the deteriorating conditions (e.g., vehicle access restrictions) for conventional vehicles, while the former is influenced by operational concerns towards cargo cycles. This observation suggests the necessity of formulating measures to foster the market penetration of cargo cycles.",0965-8564,Not found
Autonomous vehicles and moral judgments under risk,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.016,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Some criticize the data-driven study of driverless car ethics for relying on deterministic crash scenarios where the focus should be on minimizing the occurrence of accidents instead. Indeed, decisions in road traffic are taken in the domain of risk. A relevant ethical question is, however, whether autonomous vehicles should actually minimize an accident’s probability or rather balance the accident’s probability and severity. While ethicists’ introspections might lead them to different conclusions, a participatory paradigm in ethics demands to include laypeople’s intuitions into the societal debate. In three online studies, we found that the mere minimization of accident probability in ethical dilemmas does not correspond to the views of our sample. Our participants favor a balanced consideration of accident probability and severity. This remains true even if the underlying dilemma is based on a more realistic scenario of allocating minor risks among road users. Our findings furthermore illustrate that trolley problems may be informative for autonomous vehicles and emphasize the importance of transparency if manufacturers and the public do not agree on guiding principles in road traffic.",0965-8564,Not found
How older adults use Ride-hailing booking technology in California,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.022,155,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber have the potential to improve mobility for many older adults, especially those who cannot or prefer not to drive. We used survey data from 2,917 Californians 55 years and older to investigate (1) how older adults who currently ride-hail booked their trips, and (2) what personal characteristics, including attitudes towards technology, were correlated with booking trips online versus by phone or with help. We specified four binary probit models in which the outcome variables are the manner in which a respondent accessed ride-hailing services: self-booked by phone, self-booked by app, booked by a family/friend/caregiver but rode alone, or booked by others and rode with them. We controlled for two attitudinal constructs (confident and cautious about technology), residential location, general travel behavior, physical health, and standard socio-economic factors. We found that respondents who were more confident using technology booked via apps, while those who were more cautious about technology were less likely to book using apps. This latter group was more likely to book by phone or rely on others for help. Other characteristics associated with higher likelihood of booking via apps were: living in the suburbs, not relying on others for rides, having physical health issues, being college educated, and being non-Hispanic. Our findings provide a basis to think about expanding ride-hailing to other older adults, particularly those who are not comfortable with technology, through convenient access to ride-hailing booking.",0965-8564,Not found
Acceptance of a Pay-How-You-Drive pricing scheme for city traffic: The case of Athens,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.009,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"In order to investigate the acceptance of a Pay-How-You-Drive (PHYD) road pricing system in Athens, Greece, a novel scheme is proposed which is designed to provide recommendations to the drivers in order to change their behavior towards a more ecological one and charges more those that would not follow them. For modeling the acceptance of the system’s recommendations, first, a stated preferences questionnaire survey was designed and conducted on 600 drivers. Next, several Machine Learning models were developed to identify the characteristics that may affect the acceptance of such a scheme. To enrich the modeling process, a clustering framework was exploited to separate the respondents into different profiles, based on their mobility pattern and their attitude towards eco-driving. Furthermore, novel interpretation techniques, namely the calculation of permutation importance and partial dependence, were applied to gain a deeper understanding of the models’ outputs. Findings revealed that the percent of travel time increase when following the system’s recommendation and the offered discount are the most important determinants of the system’s acceptance. More specifically, the estimation of the value of time showed that those who would drive ecologically would expect a discount of 0.21€ for each minute of additional travel time. The results of this research can be exploited in the design of fair toll systems that will meet the requirements of potential users, as well as the needs of demand-responsive and eco-friendly urban road networks.",0965-8564,Not found
"Fare evasion on public transport: Who, when, where and how?",10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.027,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Transantiago, the public transport system of Santiago, Chile, has one of the highest fare evasion rates registered worldwide. The official statistics for late 2019 indicated that the evasion rate in bus legs was 26.6% while in metro it was almost 0%. This is a relevant issue due to the impacts of fare evasion on finances and quality of service, as budget constraints put pressure on the transit system. Analysing and understanding fare evasion should be the starting point for proposing solutions that could reduce it. Therefore, in this research we seek to answer the question of who are the evaders, when and where evasion happens and how is the fare evaded on public transport. To answer these questions, extensive data was gathered onboard buses of Transantiago for five full days (19 h a day) of operation, including weekdays and weekend. A total of 10,559 individual records were collected. The information considers age and gender of travellers, and fare evasion was measured in zones of Santiago that are characterised by very different economic conditions. Records also differ in terms of bus occupancy, presence of turnstiles in the buses, and types of stops (with and without off-board payment). Based on the collected information, a Binomial Logit model was calibrated to understand and explain fare evasion, quantifying the effect of different types of explanatory variables. Results show that fare evasion is higher for young men, evening and night periods, low-income neighbourhoods, crowded buses without turnstiles, bus stops without off-board payment and weak accessibility to metro stations and fare vending machines. The model does not only allows the identification of these trends, but is also able to quantify them. Based on the results, potential proposed solutions to tackle evasion are discussed.",0965-8564,Not found
Microsimulation parking choice and search model to assess dynamic pricing scenarios,10.1016/j.tra.2021.12.013,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"This article analyses the impact that different parking management policies may have on public roads. Policies were simulated using a new parking model based on two sub models: choice of parking place and search for parking place. The model considers curb traffic and was implemented into a traditional microsimulation traffic software. The parameters for the sub models were estimated from data collected in the city centre of Santander (Spain) and from a stated preferences survey asked to users of parking spaces. The model for testing policies was run on Aimsun simulation software creating a personalised API programmed using Python 3.7. The proposed model was able to dynamically simulate various policies based on charging for on-street parking spaces with fare updates at short time intervals of between 5 and 15 min. A sensitivity analysis was performed on different fare scenarios and considering different levels of information available to the users. As a result, this work demonstrates some benefits of dynamic fares such as reducing searching time, curb induced traffic and emissions as well as a new modal redistribution of parking choice between off-street and on-street supply. On the contrary, dynamic fares implied that users needed to spend a bit more time from their parking location to their destinations.",0965-8564,Not found
Rumors in the air? Exploring public misconceptions about automated vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.003,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Automated vehicles (AVs) have potential to impact transportation, mobility, and society considerably in the future. Many beliefs surrounding this technology are criticized as “misconceptions” by transport experts, developers, journalists, and communicators. Understanding how the public views these beliefs offers insights for improving public communication and policymaking. We conducted the first study on views of 24 of these beliefs, including 21 arguable misconceptions (seven optimistic beliefs, 10 pessimistic beliefs, two beliefs of low requirements for AVs, two beliefs of high requirements for AVs) and three factual misconceptions about current AVs (e.g., “AVs are already available in the market”). During June 2020, Chinese participants (N = 1209) rated their agreement with these beliefs. They reached consensus on 16 beliefs. More than 50% of participants rejected nine beliefs and supported seven beliefs. They had some misconceptions about AVs. Nearly one third believed that AVs are already available in the market. Four classes of participants emerged through latent class analysis, labeled as “don’t know” (19.2%), “neutral to positive” (32.6%), “naïve enthusiasts” (28.3%), and “sober skeptics” (19.9%). Comparison of the latter two classes demonstrated the irony that those holding more misconceptions about AVs were more receptive to AVs, whereas those holding fewer misconceptions about AVs were more skeptical about AVs. Knowing more about AVs was associated viewing AVs more negatively. Effective public communication is urgent to dispel myths about AVs and prevent AV technology from becoming controversial.",0965-8564,Not found

We observed a large increase in total biking frequency among those who started e-biking, while frequencies decreased in those who did e-bike at both time points, did not e-bike at both time points and stopped e-biking. Conventional biking frequencies decreased in all groups. No effects were observed on walking for transport, self-rated health and life space area. Functionality tended to decrease in all groups, except among those who stopped e-biking for whom no change in functionality was observed. In conclusion, e-bikes offer older adults a possibility to increase their biking levels and potentially extend their life on a bike. Future studies should use objective measures of biking volume and intensity, health and life space area and confirm whether current findings are generalizable to other regions.",0965-8564,Not found
When monetarisation and ranking are not appropriate. A novel stakeholder-based appraisal method,10.1016/j.tra.2021.12.004,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Although there is general consensus on the necessity of evaluation for decision support in major transport projects, there is no method that is universally accepted. Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is often suggested as the alternative for the dominant but much-criticised (social) cost benefit analysis (CBA), especially in complex multi-stakeholder projects. The paper argues that especially in this type of projects the applicability of conventional MCA techniques is limited because they require the project to be structured as a ranking-choice problem with multiple well-defined mutually exclusive decision alternatives. This often does not suit the planning question in the strategic early project phase, which is characterised by uncertainties relating to design, preferences and impacts. This article proposes a novel evaluation technique, Stakeholder-based Impact Scoring, the primary purpose of which is not to rank alternatives but to identify their positive and negative impacts for multiple stakeholders, in order to support the iterative improvement rather than the mere selection or rejection of alternatives. It is based on two principles: non-compensation, i.e. distinguishing positive and negative impacts; and non-relativity, i.e. the feature that alternatives are scored in comparison to a universal baseline scenario, instead of as relative to one another. The article demonstrates the technique in a project that concerns the reconfiguration of a large elevated urban motorway in Brussels, showing the added value of the method in highlighting key points of discord between stakeholders.",0965-8564,Not found
Effects and feasibility of shared mobility with shared autonomous vehicles: An investigation based on data-driven modeling approach,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.001,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Shared mobility is a promising travel mode in the era of autonomous driving. Travelers may no longer own a vehicle, but use shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) services. This study investigates the effects and feasibility of SAV-based shared mobility, which includes ride-sharing and car-sharing strategies, by using a data-driven modeling approach. Ride-sharing indicates that two trips with similar origin–destination information can be combined into a new one, whereas car-sharing indicates that trips can be fulfilled by a single vehicle consecutively. On the basis of license plate recognition data of Langfang, China, this study extracts the urban-scale vehicle travel demand information. Models for ride-sharing and car-sharing are formulated to generate SAV assignment strategies for fulfilling travel demands. This study reveals the prospects and potential problems of SAV-supported shared mobility at different development stages by setting a variety of scenarios with different participation levels of ride-sharing and car-sharing. The minimum fleet size to fulfil the vehicle travel demand in the road network and the total vehicle stock in the urban area are compared under different scenarios, and the effects of shared mobility on vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and parking demand are evaluated. This study also reveals the impacts of SAVs in a practical scenario, which is constructed based on an online survey. Results show that ride-sharing and car-sharing with high participation will lead to considerable benefits, i.e., reductions in fleet size, vehicle stock, and parking demand. Under the shared mobility scenario with 100% ride-sharing and car-sharing participation levels, one SAV can potentially replace 3.80 private conventional vehicles in the road network. However, ride-sharing and car-sharing exhibit opposite effects on VKT. Car-sharing alone increases VKT whereas car-sharing and ride-sharing together have the potential to decrease VKT. This study provides insights for understanding the development of shared mobility and facilitating the efficient utilization of SAVs.",0965-8564,Not found
Receiver willingness to participate in off-hour service programs,10.1016/j.tra.2021.12.014,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Service trips, a frequently overlooked segment of urban traffic, represent a disproportionately large share of the negative impacts associated with commercial activity. The reason is that although service trips are less frequent than freight trips, they often take longer and thus occupy a significant share of commercial parking. Demand management programs seeking to move service trips off-hours can potentially reduce congestion and emissions but they have been understudied. This paper describes research conducted to investigate receivers’ willingness to participate in off-hour programs for planned service activity. The research reported in this paper analyzes results from a survey of 189 business establishments in New York City and the Capital Region in New York State using descriptive analyses of the data, and by estimating a discrete choice model to gain insight into how business characteristics influence willingness to participate in off-hour services. To assess the impacts of a hypothetical off-hour services program, the authors applied the discrete choice model, together with service trip attraction models, to quantify the hours of daytime parking that could be eliminated by the proposed program in certain ZIP Codes in New York City and the Albany area. The research conducted led to the identification of numerous policy implications that will help policymakers understand and maximize the potential benefits of implementing off-hour service programs.",0965-8564,Not found
Plug-in electric vehicle diffusion in California: Role of exposure to new technology at home and work,10.1016/j.tra.2021.12.005,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"The market for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) --including both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs)--has been rapidly growing in California for the past few years. Given the targets for PEV penetration in the state, it is important to have a better understanding of the pattern of technology diffusion and the factors that are driving the process. Using spatial analysis and Poisson count models we identify the importance of a neighborhood effect (at home locations) and a workplace effect (at commute destinations) in supporting the diffusion of PEV technology in California between 2014 and 2016. In the case of new BEV sales, we find that exposure to one additional BEV or PHEV within a 1-mile radius of a census block group centroid is associated with a 0.2% increase in BEV sales in the block group. Interestingly, for new PHEV sales- the neighborhood effect of BEV sales is negative, suggesting that enhanced exposure to this type of technology (which is differentiated in distinctive ways from PHEVs) may impact new PHEV sales through a substitution effect. Specifically, higher BEV concentration in an area can have an overall negative effect on new PHEV sales. While the neighborhood effect at residential locations is important, a workplace effect also has a notably important influence on new PEV sales. Both effects work in combination with socioeconomic, demographic, policy, and built environment factors in encouraging PEV adoption. These results, insightful not just for California but other regions in early phases of the PEV market, suggest that policymakers should consider targeted programs and investments that can attract a wider group of early adopters (in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and spatial location) to boost the impact of neighborhood and workplace effects on PEV sales.",0965-8564,Not found

Optimal pricing and investment in a multi-modal city — Introducing a macroscopic network design problem based on the MFD,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.026,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Improving the performance of an existing transportation system is a challenge for engineers and policy makers as many dimensions and system design variables are interacting. In this paper, we propose the three-dimensional macroscopic fundamental diagram network design problem (3D-MFD-NDP). It is a strategic macroscopic tool to identify the directions of decision making in a multimodal transportation system, where the provision of roads and public transport services are interacting with costs for cars and public transport services in the performance of the entire road surface transportation system. The 3D-MFD-NDP models their effects aggregated at the network level and does not locate all measures to the road network. The objective function of the introduced 3D-MFD-NDP is minimizing the total travel time, while the design variables of the problem are the user costs for cars and bus tickets, the bus headway, the share of dedicated bus lanes and the length of the road network. The advantage of the 3D-MFD-NDP compared to existing approaches is that it is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) that allows a fast closed-form solution instead of being simulation-based, usually computing many details not required in strategic decision making. We apply the 3D-MFD-NDP to the greater area of Zurich to study two different problems. First, we investigate how the current network performance can be increased by pricing and investment measures. Despite difficulties in identifying reliable cost information for the provision of roads, we find that substantial travel time savings are possible, especially when limiting car use by restricting its space and increasing its costs. Second, we investigate the response to a 20% population growth in urban and suburban regions with car and public transport prices as well as bus frequency as the free design variables. We find that the system can accommodate the population growth, but as the system costs are shared among more users, the costs per trip are lessened, which attenuates the steering effect of prices.",0965-8564,Not found
COVID and working from home: Long-term impacts and psycho-social determinants,10.1016/j.tra.2021.12.007,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"COVID related lockdowns have forced many workers around the world into work from home (WFH) arrangements. While the proportion of people who work from home has typically been very low (4.5% in Melbourne in 2016), it is worth considering how trends might change once the world emerges out of COVID lockdowns. This paper aims to examine (1) the long-term impacts of COVID on WFH and (2) the psycho-social factors which will impact workers’ intention to increase WFH post-COVID. The paper uses the Theory of Planned Behaviour as a lens to examine these psycho-social determinants. The study uses the survey responses of 1,364 workers which were collected in June-August 2020 as part of a larger survey (n = 2,158), which aimed to capture a representative population of Greater Melbourne. Quasi-longitudinal investigation of self-reported WFH frequency revealed that WFH as a share of average weekday employment increased 310% during COVID lockdown. In the longer term, when COVID is no longer an issue, WFH can be expected to be 75% higher than pre-COVID levels. Structural Equation Modelling was applied to the Theory of Planned Behaviour to understand motivators for and barriers to increasing WFH post-COVID. Perceived Behavioural Control (e.g. job type, technology, access to materials) and Subjective Norms (e.g. employer and family support) will be crucial determinants of the intention to work from home post-COVID. Attitudes regarding WFH will only have a weak impact on future intention to work from home, a finding which contrasts with previous research.",0965-8564,Not found
A systemic model for implementing land value capture to support urban rail transit infrastructure projects,10.1016/j.tra.2021.12.010,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Urban rail transit (URT) infrastructure is critical for the economic and social development of an economy. The construction and operation of URT systems invariably require significant investment. Yet, governments are often subjected to fiscal constraints and cannot provide taxpayers with efficient and effective rails services. Development-based land value capture (LVC), a method for funding and financing infrastructure, can support URT delivery. However, there has been a tendency to apply LVC in a piecemeal manner. Thus, an absence of a systemic strategy to assist policy-makers with the implementation of LVC contributes to the ongoing debate about its effective use to support URT. Using the lens of systems thinking, our research aims to address the following research question: How can governments create an effective LVC strategy to support the procurement of their URT systems and networks? Drawing on the experiences of three Chinese cities, we develop a systemic model that policy-makers can draw upon to ensure the successful implementation of LVC. The contributions of our paper are threefold as we: (1) summarise the threads of LVC knowledge and its associated challenges; (2) provide the state-of-art experience of three cities that are using LVC to support their URT projects; and (3) identify the underlying systemic interdependencies that influence the successful adoption of the LVC strategy to support the URT system and network.",0965-8564,Not found
"Investigating the influence of weather on public transit passenger's travel behaviour: Empirical findings from Brisbane, Australia",10.1016/j.tra.2021.12.001,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Drawing on transit smart card data allied with local weather station records over a 12-month period, this paper takes Brisbane, Australia as the study context and examines the way in which weather impose influences on public transit passenger’s travel behaviour. In terms of transit passenger’s spatiotemporal origin–destination (OD) information, a new travel behaviour indicator called stickiness is developed to reflect passenger’s travel similarity in using the transit service over a period. By applying a suite of regression models, it shows that weather’s effects on transit passenger’s travel behaviour vary by temporal period and passenger type. In general, weather is shown to exert a stronger effect on passenger’s stickiness during midday off-peak hours in comparison with either AM peak or PM peak. Across all types of passengers, child passengers are found to be most tolerant to weather changes and even be stickier to their regular travel pattern during AM peak. The modelling results also reveal that when it relates to journey-to-work or journey-to-school, weather’s effects on alighting location are much smaller than other three OD-related travel behaviour features (i.e., boarding time, boarding location, and alighting time). In contrast with the postponement during AM peak, transit passengers are prone to bring forward their trip back home during PM peak in response to poor weather conditions. Moreover, this paper verifies that weather parameters are not singly perceived by transit passengers but as an interrelated unity in shaping transit passenger’s travel behaviour. By enriching the weather–travel behaviour scholarship, the empirical findings of this study are helpful to render a holistic understanding of the weather–travel behaviour relationship and have important implications for transit operators in building a more weather-resilient transit system.",0965-8564,Not found
Exploring satisfaction with air-HSR intermodal services: A Bayesian network analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2021.12.011,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Air and high-speed rail (HSR) intermodal service (AHIS) breaks through the barriers of aviation and HSR, which builds a modern integrated transportation system. However, this system also poses a challenge to operators to provide satisfactory travel services for passengers. This paper aims to identify the service indicators that influence travelers' overall satisfaction with AHIS and the relationships between them based on research data acquired from a passenger behavior survey at Shijiazhuang Zhengding International Airport (SJW) in 2019. First, a Bayesian network (BN) is constructed by integrating the greedy thick thinning (GTT) algorithm with expert knowledge. Then, sensitivity analysis and overall satisfaction prediction are conducted to determine the correlation and influence effect between service indicators and overall satisfaction. The research findings are as follows: (1) Compared to a binary logit model, the Bayesian network shows high fitting and prediction accuracies. (2) Transfer time is negatively correlated with satisfaction, for AHIS with the same total travel time, travelers tend to choose services with less transfer time since this choice increases their satisfaction. Interestingly, passengers are more tolerant of the travel time of airline than HSR. (3) Service indicators such as real-time information, arrival punctuality and ticket price have the highest sensitivity values for overall satisfaction. The results can provide useful suggestions for AHIS operators.",0965-8564,Not found
Working from home during the corona-crisis is associated with higher subjective well-being for women with long (pre-corona) commutes,10.1016/j.tra.2021.10.025,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Much research has been devoted to assessing the effect of commute duration on the subjective well-being of people, but as of yet, the respective body or research has been inconclusive as to whether there is indeed a (large) negative effect or not. To control the spread of COVID-19 governments around the world have taken unprecedented measures to control the outbreak of the Corona-virus. Forcing or strongly advising people to work from home (i.e. at least those who can) is often one of these. The ensuing situation can be considered a natural experiment; the government’s intervention effectively cancels people’s commuting trip and can be considered completely exogenous. Should commuting time indeed have an adverse effect on well-being, it may be expected that those workers with long (pre-corona) commutes who have transitioned to working from home will experience an increase in their well-being. This idea is tested by combining several surveys -timed before and after the crisis- from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social sciences (LISS) panel, a panel that is representative of the Dutch population. In line with expectations, the results indicate that workers with a long commuting duration who transitioned to working from home indeed increased their subjective well-being. However, this effect was found to be significant only for women and not for men. A more general finding of interest is that subjective well-being did not change much between the measurements before and during the corona-crisis.",0965-8564,Not found

Individuals with disabilities, an already socially disadvantaged population, are more vulnerable to and have likely been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 response conditions. Yet, the extent to which the daily community living activities of people with disabilities have been impacted is unknown. Thus, this study assesses their travel behavior and community living during the COVID-19 pandemic conditions compared with those of the general population. A web survey was conducted using Qualtrics’s online panel data (respondents included 161 people with any type of disability and 232 people without a disability). Regression models found that people with disabilities reduced their daily travel to a greater extent but at varying degrees, depending on the destination types and travel modes. Reductions in taxi rides (including ride-hailing services) were most significant among people with cognitive and sensory (e.g., vision and hearing) disabilities. By place type, cognitive disability was associated with a trip reduction for multiple destination types—grocery, restaurants, outdoor recreation, indoor recreation, and healthcare providers. Findings from this study could contribute to decision- and policy-making in planning, transportation, and community services during the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic, in future major public health crises, and post-COVID, because the adjustments in travel behavior and community living might be longer-term.",0965-8564,Not found
Generational travel patterns in the United States: New insights from eight national travel surveys,10.1016/j.tra.2021.12.002,156,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Millennials’ automobility preferences and choices have attracted widespread attention from academia, policy makers, and business industries. Existing studies, however, have reported mixed findings on whether Millennials differ from their predecessor generations, leading to contradictory conclusions drawn for transportation planning and policy recommendations. This study utilized eight U.S. national travel surveys to construct a panel data that covers a continuous range of ages for persons five years and older for Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials. With this unique dataset, the study performed analyses on the trend of daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by an average person from each generation and its subgroups. The study found that Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials shared a three-phased trending pattern of VMT over the life course but exhibited varying levels of daily VMT in different life stages. During adulthood, Millennials have kept their daily VMT consistently lower than that of Generation X by about 3 VMT, or 8%, whereas the younger group of Baby Boomers outdrove the older Millennials at age 28 and after by about 3.5 VMT, or 9% daily. When each generation is considered over its life course, peak-level daily VMT tends to occur at earlier ages for each successive generation. From the multi-level modeling of daily VMT, the study identified generation-related group effects and estimated VMT elasticities with respect to person age, driving licensure, vehicle ownership, household size, and gasoline price-adjusted income. The study’s findings on the direction and size of VMT influences associated with the five planning or policy variables did not support the speculation that Millennials would match or surpass Baby Boomers and Generation X in their future daily VMT trajectory. Public policies should be designed to nurture the shifting trend of reduced automobility from the older to the younger generations.",0965-8564,Not found
Is higher quality always costly? Marginal costs of quality: Theory and application to railway punctuality,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.007,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"In the railway sector, there has been much discussion about the costs of delays to passengers and their willingness-to-pay to reduce them. However, the cost of delays in the supply side of transport markets have received far less attention (Van Oort, 2016). This paper fills several gaps in the transport and railway literature by studying the relationship between the costs of railway supply and travel time reliability. First we articulate a generic theoretical framework for the relationship between costs and quality in railways, building on past contributions in other sectors and bringing together diverse and currently disconnected literatures. A key new element of the framework is the explicit introduction of the concepts of ‘marginal proactive cost’ and ‘marginal reactive cost’. Second, through the lens of this framework, we empirically study the relationship between the cost of passenger train operation companies (TOCs) in Great Britain (2011 to 2015) and the reliability of their services, thus producing the first estimates in the literature of the elasticity of train operating company cost with respect to train delays, and in turn marginal cost of reducing delays. We find that for most TOCs improving quality is costly but, for some, quality improvements would be associated with lower costs overall, indicating that some operators are on a sub-optimal portion of the cost-quality curve. The framework and analysis can be used to aid quality related decisions in the railways including the design of incentive regimes; and can also be applied to other cost-quality contexts, in and outside transportation.",0965-8564,Not found

This phenomenon is well-known for interurban roads, especially for motorways, but the literature is scarce on real-life data for urban areas. Most analyses on induced traffic were carried out on relatively short time periods. Therefore, this paper studies 55 years in an urban environment and shows how capacity provision induced extra traffic. Furthermore, it could also be demonstrated that scaling back capacity diminishes travel demand. Most of the analyses on induced traffic concentrated on just a handful of countries; therefore, evidence from a country that emerged from middle income to high income provides new insights for other developing nations and cities.",0965-8564,Not found
Meta-analysis of British time-related demand elasticity evidence: An update,10.1016/j.tra.2022.02.001,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Far less attention has been paid in review studies to time-related elasticities than price elasticities, and this is partly because there is less evidence. Nonetheless, time elasticities are important parameters for transport planning, forecasting and appraisal. This paper builds upon Wardman (2012), which then provided the most extensive account of demand elasticities to car, rail and bus time, rail and bus headway, and rail generalised journey time. It is based upon 741 elasticities drawn from 102 British studies published between 1977 and 2020, as opposed to the 427 elasticities from 69 studies published up to 2010 in the previous study. It recovered significant effects for attribute, mode, data used in estimation, distance, journey purpose, the measure of demand response and area type, all of which can be implemented in practical demand forecasting. It was unable to detect variations in elasticities over time, despite extensive testing, but casts doubts on whether elasticities drawn from discrete choice models represent long run effects and on the reliability of elasticities estimated to cross-sectional demand and transfer price data. Whilst we identify long run elasticities, of themselves these are limited if it is not known how long the long run is. Complementary insight is presented on the length of the long run, although this revealed quite significantly that the long run is critically dependent upon the periodicity of the time-series data used in estimation. The estimated meta-model provides credible demand elasticities for the variables covered. These implied elasticities are useful for benchmarking purposes and where no other evidence exists. We regard them to be transferable to similar situations outside of the British context to which they relate, particularly the methodological insights and the incremental elasticity effects. The implied elasticities are in some cases somewhat different to the previous study and also provide challenges to the elasticities recommended by the Department for Transport and the railway industry in Great Britain.",0965-8564,Not found

However, it is unclear how should the government set the trip fares and fleet sizes of a market with traditional street-hail taxis and the ride-sourcing service to maximize social benefit when both congestion effects and emission externalities are considered. Moreover, there have been real-world practices to reduce emissions from taxis and ride-sourcing vehicles by controlling the numbers of gasoline vehicles and electric vehicles. On one hand, some cities (e.g., Shenzhen, London) have launched a taxi replacement project that replaces all fossil-fueled taxis with electric taxis. On the other hand, the regulation preventing gasoline vehicles from being registered as ride-sourcing vehicles can also be observed. It remains a question of how should the social optimal fares and fleet sizes in a market with electric taxis and ride-sourcing vehicles be different from those in the market with gasoline vehicles. To address the above questions, this study investigates the optimal trip fare and fleet size regulation in an aggregate taxi/ride-sourcing market with congestion effects and environmental externalities. Two market scenarios are investigated, in which all taxis/ride-sourcing vehicles are gasoline vehicles or electric vehicles.

Parking pricing strategies and behaviour: Evidence from the Netherlands,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.005,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Parking policy has long been considered an important tool for the management of urban mobility. One of the major policy dilemmas that urban planners face is the choice between short term versus long term parking i.e., the choice between a parking policy that stimulates short term parking [usually up to 2–3 h] and a policy that stimulates long term parking [usually between 4 and 8 h]. Pricing is the most important tool used by planners to make this choice. Yet, literature suggests that parking demand is inelastic. Accordingly, pricing only might not be enough if local authorities want to influence parking behaviour. We analyse three different parking policies commonly used in European cities – namely pricing only, pricing and time restrictions and daily tickets only – to understand the effects of these policies on a specific aspect of parking behaviour, namely the length of stay. We base our findings on the spatial analysis of 32 million mobile parking transactions made in 2018 in the Netherlands, obtained from a large parking provider. Findings indicate that time restrictions seem more effective than pricing only strategies in managing length of parking stay.",0965-8564,Not found
Public preferences for distribution in the context of transport investments,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.013,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"In this paper, we present a study of Swedish inhabitants' preferences for distribution in three dimensions in the context of transport investments. Using choice experiments, we study the respondents' preferences for the distribution of benefits in the geographical, gender, and income dimension in relation to aggregate benefits. We find that they have quite strong preferences for equality in all dimensions, especially in the gender dimension. Additionally, when distribution is unequal, respondents tend to prefer that it is uneven in favour of non-metropolitan regions, women and low-income earners. We also find that variables describing self-interest, some general beliefs and the extent to which respondents consider the Swedish society to be fair may explain some preference heterogeneity.",0965-8564,Not found
Mobility at the crossroads – Electric mobility policy and charging infrastructure lessons from across Europe,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.010,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The transportation sector accounts for a significant part of European emissions and is one of the few sectors with rising emissions. Thus one crucial part of the European strategy to reduce overall emissions is a shift, in the transportation sector, to low-emission mobility and electric mobility in particular. As European governments and policymakers consider feasible ways of supporting the transition, one central question is whether the policies and actions they enact should aim for creating incremental or structural change, here operationalized as personal incentives vs. charging infrastructure. Therefore, this analysis investigates the effects of electric mobility policies and charging infrastructure on plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) market shares in Europe from 2009 to 2019. Charging infrastructure, and fast charging infrastructure in particular, demonstrate by far the strongest and most robust results of the analysis, having a significant positive effect on PEV market shares in all models. The analysis also suggests that purchase incentives, ownership tax benefits, and the policy packages for electric mobility tested have a positive and significant effect on PEV adoption. However, these effects are notably weaker and exhibit far less robust findings across the models in the analysis. Thus, while the study cannot conclusively come down on the side of infrastructure over personal incentives, it persuasively points to the crucial importance of charging infrastructures for the electrification of transportation. Theoretically, this makes sense—personal incentives will increase the market shares of PEV, but only incrementally, running the risk of merely supplementing the old fossil fuel-based transportation system rather than replacing it. Charging infrastructure on the other hand creates the potential for structural change, implying that a more active and coordinated build-out of charging infrastructure is needed to ensure a rapid transition to low-emission mobility.",0965-8564,Not found
Transportation and quality of life: Evidence from Denmark,10.1016/j.tra.2021.12.003,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"This paper investigates the importance of transportation for quality of life in Denmark. We first calibrate a simple general equilibrium model to analyse how local wage levels, housing costs, and commuting costs vary across urban areas as well as to construct a quality of life index that measures a representative household’s willingness to pay for local amenities. We find that the quality of life is high in large cities. Wages and rents are also substantially higher in urban areas. We then regress the quality of life index on observed amenities to infer how quality of life is associated with transportation. Our empirical results suggest that the quality of the public transport system is particularly important for the quality of life.",0965-8564,Not found
Exploiting floating car data to derive the shifting potential to electric micromobility,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.008,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Electric micromobility systems such as e-bikes and e-scooters represent sustainable mobility options especially for specific classes of travelled distances. Moreover, the coverage and accessibility of transit services can be expanded through the implementation and promotion of these systems. Therefore, transport engineering is dealing with the development of new tools to support the forecast of the potential demand both for door-to-door trips and its integration with transit. With respect to these incoming research challenges, the paper proposes a methodology to investigate private mobility through floating car data (FCD) to identify the potential demand that can be shifted from cars to electric micromobility (e-micromobility) systems while also exploring the opportunity to increase transit usage. The benefits of such methodology have been evaluated on a real large test case, i.e. Rome (Italy), through an FCD dataset of about 240,000 monitored vehicles. The developed methodology is parametric and, thus, it can be easily transferred to other city contexts taking into consideration the compatibility of the local network infrastructures and the micromobility solutions. In Rome, it was estimated that the potential demand for e-micromobility can reach a maximum value of about 20% of weekday-trips, while about 10% of the morning peak trips could potentially be interested in a multimodal trip (i.e. mass transit services and e-micromobility for the access/egress). Results can be adopted by local authorities, transport companies and electric mobility providers to optimize infrastructural measures or the location of shared e-scooters and e-bikes to increase potential e-micromobility demand, as well as to increase the number of multimodal mobility options.",0965-8564,Not found
Assessing the safety effectiveness of citywide speed limit reduction: A causal inference approach integrating propensity score matching and spatial difference-in-differences,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.004,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The New York City (NYC) initiated a new default speed limit law on November 7th, 2014, where speed limits on all road segments without a posted speed limit were reduced from 30 mph to 25 mph. The safety effectiveness of citywide speed limit reduction in an urban setting like NYC has been understudied in the literature. The high-density road network of NYC could lead to a significant spatial spillover effect of speed limit reduction on its neighboring sites. In addition, citywide speed limit reduction exerts much more treatment sites than control sites, which makes it challenging to identify sufficient control sites with similar covariates as the treated ones and thus may lead to confounding bias. Furthermore, there could also exist a time trend in crash observations caused by unobserved factors (e.g., enforcement, driving behaviors). To jointly account for spatial spillover effect, confounding bias, and time trend, this study proposes a novel causal inference approach integrating propensity score matching (PSM) and spatial difference-in-differences (SDID) to estimate the safety effectiveness of citywide speed limit reduction in NYC. The PSM utilizes a logistic generalized additive model (GAM) to capture the nonlinear relationship between covariates and the treatment indicator to reduce bias due to confounding variables. Moreover, the matched data are used to develop the SDID model that simultaneously captures spatial spillover effect and time trend via the extended difference-in-differences (DID) structure. The proposed causal approach suggests that the speed limit reduction would result in a 62.09% decrease in fatal crashes, with the spatial spillover effect found to be statistically significant. However, it does not indicate a significant change in injury and property-damage-only crashes as a result of the speed limit reduction. This study adds to the literature a robust causal inference approach for safety evaluation and provides researchers, practitioners, policy-makers insights into the safety effectiveness of the speed limit reduction in an urban setting.",0965-8564,Not found
What's eating public transit in the United States? Reasons for declining transit ridership in the 2010s,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.002,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Despite ever-increasing public and financial support for public transportation in recent decades, transit ridership has dropped substantially in the 2010s across the United States. While many theories that explain the reasons behind the decline in ridership have been proposed, no consensus on the primary causes has been reached. By employing gradient boosting decision tree and counterfactual simulations, we examine the complex relationships between transit ridership and key internal and external factors from 2002 to 2017 in 85 of the largest urbanized areas in the US. Among several contributing factors, the declining cost of driving, measured by the decreasing share of carless households combined with lower gasoline prices, was the salient, most influential factor behind the recent decline. Neighborhood change in high-density neighborhoods also led to a moderate net loss in ridership. The only factor that has been mitigating further decline was an increase in transit services. Had this increase not occurred, loss of ridership would have been more than double the actual loss during the study period.",0965-8564,Not found
Designing sustainable intermodal freight transportation networks using a controlled rail tariff discounting policy – The Iranian case,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.012,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Moving freight by intermodal services instead of road services not only saves a large amount of fuel but also improves sustainability. This paper presents a sustainable Intermodal Freight Transportation Network Design Problem (IFTNDP) in which the effectiveness of a new short-term policy, called controlled rail tariff discounting policy, is evaluated. In the IFTNDP, the government locates intermodal hubs and cooperates with rail companies to offer discounted rail tariffs on the rail connections of intermodal routes. Rail companies are allowed to customize the amount of rail tariff discounting for the network’s OD flows and rail connections. In addition, the government compensates the losses that rail companies incur due to offering the rail tariff discounts by the amount that will be collected from fuel savings in the freight transportation system. Hence, the government can boost the utility of intermodal transportation without investing funds to compensate the losses of rail companies. A stated preference model based on a questionnaire is adapted to identify users’ route choice behaviour. Then, the users’ route choice behavior is incorporated into the IFTNDP by a set of constraints, depending on the road and intermodal travelling times and costs. The model is applied to a real freight network and insights made by undertaking sensitivity analyses. The results demonstrate that the controlled rail tariff discounting policy not only increases the contribution of freight intermodal transportation in moving total freight but also enhances government’s profits from fuel savings after compensating rail companies’ losses.",0965-8564,Not found
Economic policy choices and trade-offs for Unmanned aircraft systems Traffic Management (UTM): Insights from Europe and the United States,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.006,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Despite expectations of substantial growth in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS, also called drones) there is currently no large-scale system in place to manage UAS operating in shared airspace. Many countries are developing UAS Traffic Management (UTM) concepts which, unlike conventional air traffic management (ATM), seek to foster a competitive market involving many private actors and service providers and which rely on the cooperative and distributed management of UAS. This paper focusses on the economic policy dimensions of UTM. It describes the main participants, activities and commercial interactions of the emerging UTM concepts in the European Union and the United States. Building on these descriptions, we then consider some of the fundamental choices and trade-offs confronting policymakers when developing an economic policy framework for UTM such as: which activities should be competitive; how can access to scarce airspace be allocated in a safe, fair and efficient way; on what commercial terms will data be shared among participants; what infrastructure can cater for large scale UAS operations; and to what extent should the economic regulatory frameworks for UTM and ATM be aligned.",0965-8564,Not found
Mode choice between autonomous vehicles and manually-driven vehicles: An experimental study of information and reward,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.011,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"An increase in autonomous vehicles (AVs) would result in a decline in traffic congestion; however, the travel cost associated with AVs is always higher than that of manually-driven vehicles (MV). This situation is interpreted as a so-called multi-player social dilemma. This study designed an economic experiment to investigate the effect of AVs on mode choice in mixed traffic flows. Participants were informed about the cost function in both modes and were asked to choose the travel mode for more than 60 rounds. In full information (FI) treatment, participants received information about the travel costs of the AV and MV modes at the end of each round. In the partial information (PI) treatment, participants received information only about the travel cost of the mode they chose. We found that participants were sensitive to cost differences in the FI treatments. Based on inequality aversion models, we proposed a perceived cost that could better explain the experimental equilibrium. A monetary reward was provided to encourage participants to take AVs and solve social dilemmas. The results demonstrated that the reward mechanism reduces traffic congestion and increases social benefits, especially in the FI treatment. Finally, a learning model that considers inertia and perceived cost is proposed to explain the decision-making process of the participants during the experiment. The findings have implications for traffic forecasting in the mixed flow of MVs and AVs and provide insights and policy suggestions for AV management.",0965-8564,Not found
Enhancing resilience through port coalitions in maritime freight networks,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.015,157,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Reliable port services are key to maritime freight transport system performance. These systems are vulnerable to disasters of anthropogenic or natural cause, which can significantly impact port capacity, handling times and overall system performance. To improve resilience of individual ports, strategies involving capacity sharing and protective cross-port investments through coalition formation are proposed. This collaborative port protection and investment approach to improve individual and system-level port resilience is formulated as an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints. That is, the program is bi-level with multiple players in the upper level and a common liner shipping problem in the lower level. Its solution is obtained at a Nash equilibrium wherein no port stakeholder can achieve better performance by unilaterally changing its investment plan. A Stackelberg equilibrium between upper and lower levels infers that best investment decisions are made given competition between ports and the market’s response to improvements. The benefits of regional coalitions in this co-opetitive (competitive and collaborative) environment in terms of port and system resilience, port- and system-level demand fulfilment rates and return on investment are investigated from multiple perspectives, including the perspectives of shippers, port owners and the larger shipping network. With insights gained through study of the proposed coalition policies, this work aims to facilitate port authorities in making decisions on port capacity expansion, infrastructure investment and forming strategic partnerships. Shipping companies may also take into consideration the ability of a port to provide service under disruption events when choosing which ports to include in their service loops.",0965-8564,Not found
Necessary and sufficient conditions for attractive public Transport: Combined use of PLS-SEM and NCA,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.012,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"In order to effectively manage transportation systems, and improve the attractiveness of public transport, public authorities, policymakers and researchers need a better understanding of the conditions necessary for improving attractiveness and those that can be considered sufficient. The purpose of this study is to expand the analytical toolbox of transportation research and introduce an analytical approach to identifying and distinguishing between the conditions that are necessary and sufficient for a desired outcome. Specifically, we suggest a complementary approach to combining partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and necessary condition analysis (NCA) in order to examine which service quality attributes (functionality, information, security/safety, comfort, and cost) are sufficient, and what degree of satisfaction with these attributes is necessary for high overall travel satisfaction. The data consists of subjectively reported experiences from over 900 users of public transportation in four northern European countries. We find that, for high overall travel satisfaction, a minimum level of satisfaction with comfort (equal to 33.1%) is necessary. Furthermore, an increase in satisfaction with comfort, functionality/reliability and cost is sufficient to improve overall travel satisfaction. This means that comfort is both a necessary and a sufficient condition, whereas functionality/reliability and cost are sufficient but non-necessary conditions in this context. We conclude that using this complementary approach can guide public transport managers and researchers in identifying important bottlenecks and establishing priorities for improving service quality, essential knowledge when developing effective strategies for attractive public transport services.",0965-8564,Not found

There has been a large body of research investigating the effect of determinants on the loyalty formation of public transport passengers. However, the impact of social cues from other passengers, which are part of the social environment, have received less attention. This study developed a theoretical model to examine the complex relationships among the cues from other passengers, perceived security and safety, perceived value, WOM and ICU. Cues from other passengers involved three dimensions: similarity, physical appearance, and suitable behaviour. These three dimensions were measured using a formative approach in structural equation modelling (SEM). Additionally, the moderating effects of demographic characteristics on the formation of public transport passenger behaviours were explored by multi-group SEM. The model was empirically tested using data collected from more than 870 bus passengers in two big cities in Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh and Danang city). The results showed that social cues from other passengers have a strong predictive power over the WOM and ICU of bus passengers. The study successfully demonstrated the critical role of demographic characteristics as moderators on loyalty formation. The findings reported in the present investigation provide several theoretical and practical implications.",0965-8564,Not found

While other health threats and geographical disasters have occurred, none have been on the global scale of COVID-19. Although many countries have experienced more than one wave of the pandemic throughout 2020, Australia has been largely able to contain the impact of the virus. While there are many reasons for this, a key component of reducing transmission has been restrictions on movement, and the widespread adoption of working from home (WFH) by those who can. In describing the experience Australian’s have had with working from home across 2020, via three waves of data collection, we find that WFH become a positive unintended consequence in contributing to the future management of the transport network, especially in larger metropolitan areas. Evidence suggests that support for WFH will be continuing in the form of a hybrid work model with more flexible working times and locations, linked to largely positive experiences of WFH during 2020, an improved wellbeing of employees, and no loss of productivity to the economy. We highlight potential future benefits of WFH to society, including significant implications for congestion and crowding, concluding that WFH is a formidable transport policy lever that must become embedded in the psyche of transport planners and decision makers so that we can gain some benefit from the pandemic.",0965-8564,Not found

COVID-19 brought, suddenly and unexpectedly, severe changes to the trip structure within urban areas, as several restrictions were combined with individual health fears. This study addresses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the territory of Porto Greater Urban Area, in Portugal, measured under a structural accessibility approach. This was evaluated through a simulation model, combining different destination restrictions in three alternative scenarios during the pandemic and post-COVID, as well as the definition of four different personas, with distinct risk aversion to infections and telecommuting patterns. The results, presented as the spatial configuration of different mobility environments, foster a critical reflection on their implication for future transportation and land use policies. This pandemic has shown that the territory behaves differently under a critical lockdown scenario, where active modes gain predominance to satisfy most travel needs, signalling a potential ability to enforce more sustainable mobility habits. Still, as the territorial configuration tends to the previous state of equilibrium as restrictions are lifted, particularly for non-telecommuters, the need for acting quickly is reinforced. While the growth of telecommuting can induce additional challenges to the management of urban mobility systems, most policy recommendations that were valid in the past will maintain its relevance, as non telecommuters will retain previous travel habits.",0965-8564,Not found

Train travel in corona time: Safety perceptions of and support for policy measures,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.005,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"To minimize the risk of becoming infected by the Coronavirus while traveling by train, the national government and the Dutch railways' operator (NS) in the Netherlands have taken several policy measures. These involve that passengers have to wear masks and guidelines are issued for working at home and teaching online. In addition, other policy measures, such as introducing a reservation system, were considered. To examine to what extent train travelers support policy measures and how these change their perception of becoming infected while traveling by train, a stated preference experiment is conducted. Respondents were asked to evaluate various combinations of policy measures, both whether they consider it safe to travel by train under the stated conditions and whether they would vote in favor of the policy package in a referendum. To analyze the data, a mediation choice model is developed, which allows disentangling the direct effect of the policy measures on support and the indirect effect mediated by infection safety perception. To illustrate this, the results show that implementing the policy measure teaching on campus with later starting times would decrease travelers’ infection safety perception and therefore indirectly decrease its support. However, the positive direct effect on support suggests that travelers like this option better than teaching online, the guideline that applied at the time of data collection. The direct and indirect effects cancel each other out, indicating that this alternative policy measure would not count on more support than the guideline teaching online. Furthermore, this paper examines the heterogeneity in the support for policy measures by presenting and discussing the results of a Latent Class Choice Model. Amongst others, the results reveal that one class strongly supports the policy measure reservation system, while another class stongly opposes this measure, suggesting that implementing this measure is not trivial as suggested by its moderate effects at the aggregate level.",0965-8564,Not found

Adoption of partially automated vehicle technology features and impacts on vehicle miles of travel (VMT),10.1016/j.tra.2022.02.010,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"In this paper, we examine vehicle owners’ adoption of five different types of partially automated features (PAFs); lane keeping system, backup camera (BUC), adaptive cruise control (ACC), automatic braking system (ABS), and blind spot monitoring; as well as PAF effects on vehicle miles of travel (VMT). The joint modeling of PAF adoption and VMT is achieved using both individual demographic characteristics as well as psycho-social characteristics. A Generalized Heterogeneous Data Model (GHDM) is estimated, which controls for possible self-selection effects in PAF adoption based on VMT, and thus is able to provide “true” PAF effects on VMT. Our analysis specifically indicates that ignoring this self-selection can lead to a significant underestimation of the VMT increase due to PAF adoption. The results also indicate that women and older individuals (65 years or older) appear to be more inclined to invest in assistive PAFs, because of a perception that these assistive features still leave the human driver in control. However, women are less likely than men to invest in the more active ABS PAF because of heightened safety concerns with technology. In terms of PAF effects on VMT, PAFs focusing on lateral movement assistance appear to have a smaller VMT effect than those that serve longitudinal movement assistance. The highest estimated VMT change of 2,462 miles (13.8% change) is for the case when the package of BUC, ACC, and ABS is installed for middle-aged men. The highest percentage VMT change (40%), though, is for the same package of BUC, ACC, and ABS for older women. Overall, there are considerable variations in VMT impact across demographic groupings, suggesting that a single aggregate percentage improvement in safety benefits may suffer from the well-known ecological fallacy.",0965-8564,Not found
Quantifying wider economic impacts of high-speed connectivity and accessibility: The case of the Karnataka high-speed rail,10.1016/j.tra.2022.02.011,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Inter-regional high-speed connectivity and accessibility through public transportation modes such as High-Speed Rail (HSR) are crucial for sustainable and uniform development. However, it can be a costly affair considering the enormous capital it requires against direct user benefits.

However, lack of research exists towards a method that quantifies productivity changes at an organizational (institutional or industrial) level. This study proposes an optimization problem to optimize infrastructure investment from an organizational perspective in an upcoming campus. The optimization problem manifests the impact of high-speed connectivity on organizational productivity by integrating land price elasticity and workforce availability for inter-regional movement. A case study of a new institutional IISc campus in the upcoming Science City at Challakere in the state of Karnataka, India, is taken that gives a perspective for decision-making to improve productivity for a given investment and inter-regional connectivity level. The productivity is measured in terms of the number of publications, and the transportation connectivity is assessed with four scenarios: current road network and HSR with speeds 180,250 and 320 kmph. The result of the case study shows that maximum achievable productivity gets affected with transportation connectivity level (Road < HSR 180 < HSR 250 < HSR 320). In different scenarios, Road, HSR 180, HSR 250 and HSR 320, maximum achievable productivity is 237, 266, 272 and 277, respectively.

The adoption of alternative delivery locations in New York City: Who and how far?,10.1016/j.tra.2022.02.006,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Online shopping has shown a remarkable growth trend for the past three decades. The increasing demand for deliveries resulting from online shopping generates lots of negative externalities contributing to traffic congestion, parking violations, and air pollution. To mitigate these negative externalities, the importance of an alternative delivery location (ADL) is growing in transportation area as delivery and transportation systems are intertwined. The ADL includes a delivery locker (e.g., Amazon Hub Locker), a brick-and-mortar store who partners with parcel delivery companies (e.g., UPS Access Points), and a postal store. Despite the growing size and importance of the ADL, little is known about receivers’ behavior on the ADL from the transportation perspective. To better understand the ADL, this research developed joint models of parcel demand and the ADL to investigate factors affecting (a) the adoption of the ADL and (b) the distance people are willing to travel using the NYC DOT Citywide Mobility Survey in 2018. The results show that delivery frequency received by respondents negatively affects the adoption but does not affect the tolerable distance. The impacts of socio-demographic attributes on the behavior are also discussed. A prediction to the entire population in Manhattan was made and a corresponding strategy to determine the optimal ADL location is discussed.

Understanding the generation mechanism of BEV drivers' charging demand: An exploration of the relationship between charging choice and complexity of trip chaining patterns,10.1016/j.tra.2022.02.007,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"In the context of the rapid popularization of battery electric vehicles (BEV), it has become a key problem to deeply understand the charging demand and reasonably configure charging facilities. Exploring the relationship between trip chaining patterns and charging choice of battery electric vehicle users may aid in understanding the mechanism of charging demand. Based on the recursive simultaneous bivariate probit model, we integrate the impact of BEV users’ risk aversion attitude and develop two causal structures: one is that the charging choice is determined first and influences trip chaining pattern, the other is that trip chaining pattern is determined first and influences charging choice. Next, a stated preference survey is conducted through online platform and field survey, and a total of 494 valid questionnaires are collected. The model results show that the fitting effect of the causal structure model where trip chaining pattern precedes charging choice is better than another causal structure model. Moreover, integrating the influence of risk aversion attitude in the form of latent variable into the RSBP model can significantly improve the fit goodness of the model. These findings will help to further understand the mechanism of charging demand and have some implications on estimating charging demand.",0965-8564,Not found
Analysis of the barriers to the adoption of zero-emission vehicles in Spain,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.016,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"This paper investigates Spanish drivers’ perceptions of the main barriers existing in Spain to the purchase of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). Following a comprehensive literature review in this field, this paper quantifies, by means of a survey conducted in Spain of 1474 Spanish drivers, the drivers’ desired levels for each barrier to consider ZEVs in their next purchase decision to replace their current usually-used car. The analysis of these reported levels with latent class cluster models revealed the existence, in the sample, of groups of consumers with homogeneous preferences regarding the barriers. These groups differ in terms of individuals’ characteristics, the car to be replaced, and journeys made with it. The most flexible groups comprise individuals with a significant knowledge of ZEVs, which underscores the importance of educational policies for the promotion of the use of ZEVs. The desired levels of the barriers for each group are confronted with the current status of the barriers for certain ZEVs. This comparison reveals that Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) would have great potential if they received government support, because their only barriers are economic (purchase price and fuel availability). This paper also quantifies the effects that purchase incentives and infrastructure investment policies could have in terms of higher FCEV penetration rates.",0965-8564,Not found
Wages and accessibility – Evidence from Denmark,10.1016/j.tra.2022.02.002,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"We estimate the elasticity of wages in Denmark with respect to the accessibility to jobs. This elasticity is used as an estimate for the productivity effects of transport infrastructure changes and is to be applied in calculations of the wider economic benefits of transport in policy appraisals in Denmark. The accessibility is a measure of economic density and is calculated as a weighted number of accessible jobs, where the weights are determined by a decreasing function of the generalised travel cost. The decay parameter determining the distance weighting is estimated from the data. We use a combination of different approaches, to control for selection bias and test the robustness of the results. The estimates are robust to the different estimation strategies. Over all, the elasticity varies in the range 0.008–0.037, and the estimates from our preferred models vary in the range 0.025–0.029.",0965-8564,Not found
The role of household modality style in first and last mile travel mode choice,10.1016/j.tra.2022.02.003,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"In the context of public transport, the first and last mile (FLM) travel refers to access to or egress from public transport stations. The poor connection between trip origins and destinations impedes the transition towards sustainable transport by requiring commuters to initially use their cars to travel the FLM. Existing literature identifies that the built and natural environment characteristics influence the travel mode choice for FLM travel. However, this literature has yet to consider how individual FLM travel mode choices are influenced by other household members, i.e., intra-household interactions. Here, this study draws on the notion of household modality style (i.e., reflecting heterogeneity in group decision-making) to account for intra-household interactions in FLM travel mode choice. For broadening the understanding of intra-household interactions, the decision of joint travel is also considered in the current study when understanding FLM travel mode choice. By defining the latent class structure at the household level using a household travel survey for Brisbane, Australia, the latent class nested logit models identify two household modality styles: (1) car-oriented; and (2) multimodal. When considering the decision of joint travel, each household modality style group has a specific preference towards FLM travel time, public transport accessibility, station density, and road network intersection density. These findings provide evidence for policymakers aiming to develop transport integration policies targeting specific household types. The results also have implications in practice through prioritisations of distinct household modality styles more likely to shift towards sustainable transport modes.",0965-8564,Not found
Operational speed strategy opportunities for autonomous trucking on highways,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.014,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"This study examines the potential for cost and carbon emission reduction for autonomous trucks to adopt lower peak speeds than today's human driven trucks, where the hourly cost of the driver remains a significant trade-off. Adopting lower speeds presents an indirect savings opportunity in addition to savings associated with the removal of the driver. Benefits and trade-offs for varying target speed of autonomous trucks on highways were investigated with a parameterised analysis of transport and cargo cost components. A validated fuel consumption model was used to compare fuel consumption for different speed strategies across idealised highway drive-cycles and vehicle scenarios. A volume-limited tractor-trailer (50% cargo mass capacity) could reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions by 26% when reducing target speed from 90 km/h to 70 km/h. When the trade-offs of driver, vehicle and cargo time are considered for the same 20 km/h target speed reduction, combined costs increase by 3% for the human driver scenario, but decrease by 4% for an autonomous truck (assuming medium cargo time value). Sensitivity to vehicle type, loading, drive-cycle and cargo value was examined. A UK supermarket chain case study was investigated and key differences between a UK and US context were compared. Mandatory rest breaks and Hours-of-Service restrictions were identified as additional barriers for human driven vehicles to adopt slower speed strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
The role of residential choice on the travel behavior of young adults,10.1016/j.tra.2021.11.016,158,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Several studies have shown that the travel behavior of young adults in the United States in the past two decades differed from that of prior generations. On average, recent young adults drove fewer miles, owned fewer vehicles and made use of public transit more often. A higher share of young adults also chose to live in cities. This study examines the relationship between the location decision of young adults and their travel behavior. We examine how being a young adult and other socioeconomic variables are associated with residential location decisions, and how these in turn affect vehicle ownership, mode choice and travel distance. Our analysis uses household travel survey data from the Seattle regions collected in 2006 and 2017 and employs a recursive structural equation model to examine these questions. We find that young adult households were more likely to live closer to the city center and to have fewer vehicles than older ones. Fewer young adults also chose to own vehicles in 2017 than in 2006. While young adults made more use of non-automobile modes and had fewer person miles traveled, we find that these effects were more due to their residential location and vehicle ownership decisions than due to direct preferences about mode or distance traveled. These findings suggest that significant changes would be expected in the mode use and miles traveled among young adults if their residential location or vehicle ownership preferences change significantly due to life cycle or other factors.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper presents the largest ever meta-analysis of price elasticities of travel demand based on 2023 elasticities drawn from 204 British studies published between 1968 and 2020. A large number of credible variations in elasticities emerge that add to the evidence base, challenge some official recommendations and are useful to practitioners. The paper also presents an original meta-analysis of the length of time until the long run is achieved, based on 386 observations obtained from 47 studies.

We find significant differences between the groups, with a predominance of negative sentiments in news articles and a majority of citizens being wary of autonomous cars, while the political narrative mostly carries a positive tone. The findings highlight a dichotomous perspective about this potentially disruptive technology. This may represent a problem as the benefits of adopting autonomous cars will only come to surface if all actors are engaged and see the advantages they can bring to people’s daily lives.

An overview of effects of COVID-19 on mobility and lifestyle: 18 months since the outbreak,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.024,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The outbreak of SARS-COV-2 has led to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and caused over 4.5 million deaths worldwide by September 2021. Besides the public health crisis, COVID-19 affectedthe globaleconomy and development significantly. It also led to changes in people’s mobility and lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to short-term changes, the drastic transformation of the world may account for the potentially disruptive long-term impacts. Recognizing the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial in mitigating the negative behavioral changes that directly relate to people’s psychological and social well-being. It is important to stress that citizens and governments face an uncertain situation since nobody knows exactly how the viruses and cures will develop. Better understanding of uncertainties and evaluating behavioral changes contribute to addressing the future of urban development, public transportation, and behavioral strategies to tackle COVID-19 negative consequences. The major sources of impacts on short-term (route, departure time, mode, teleshopping, and teleworking) and medium and long-term (car ownership, work location, choice of job, and residential location) mobility decisions are mostly reviewed and discussed in this paper.",0965-8564,Not found
Traveller behaviour in public transport in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.027,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"With a few exceptions, public transport ridership around the world has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Travellers are now likely to adapt their behaviour with a focus on factors that contribute to the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Given the unprecedented spatial and temporal scale of this crisis, these changes in behaviour may even be sustained after the pandemic. To evaluate travellers’ behaviour in public transport networks during these times and assess how they will respond to future changes in the pandemic, we conduct a stated choice experiment with train travellers in the Netherlands at the end of the first infection wave. We specifically assess behaviour related to three criteria affecting the risk of COVID-19 transmission: (i) crowding, (ii) exposure duration, and (iii) prevalent infection rate. Observed choices are analysed using a latent class choice model which reveals two, nearly equally sized latent traveller segments: ‘COVID Conscious’ and ‘Infection Indifferent’. The former has a significantly higher valuation of crowding, accepting, on average 8.75 min extra waiting time (average total travel time in the choice scenarios was about 40 min) to reduce one person on-board. Moreover, this class indicates a strong desire to sit without anybody in the neighbouring seat and is quite sensitive to changes in the prevalent infection rate. By contrast, the Infection Indifferent class has a value of crowding (1.04 waiting time minutes/person) that is only slightly higher than pre-pandemic estimates and is relatively unaffected by infection rates. We find that older and female travellers are more likely to be COVD Conscious while those reporting to use the trains more frequently during the pandemic tend to be Infection Indifferent. Further analysis also reveals differences between the two segments in attitudes towards the pandemic and self-reported rule-following behaviour. We believe that the behavioural insights from this study will not only contribute to better demand forecasting for service planning but will also inform public transport policy decisions aimed at curbing the shift to private modes.",0965-8564,Not found

Understanding the psychological motivators underlying reduced transit use can help transit authorities and operators to take proactive action towards returning to the “new normal” and increasing their preparedness towards future pandemics. This study is based on the protection motivation theory to understand the effect of threat appraisal, and coping appraisal and denial mechanisms on transit use reduction for commuting. The behavioral framework is validated by a survey of 856 transit users in Israel during August 2020, three months after the end of the lockdown and before the vaccine administration. The results show that: i) Skepticism, risk ubiquity, and personal immunity beliefs lead to maladaptive threat appraisal; ii) wearing masks and social distancing are antecedents of fear of infection while using transit and reduced transit use; iii) higher perceived threat deters transit use, while trust in transit operators motivates transit use; and iv) in a franchised transit system, trust in transit operators depends on the perceived level-of-service and trust in the ability of government authorities to regulate, monitor and enforce transit operators' preventive and protective actions.",0965-8564,Not found
An auction framework for assessing the tendering of subsidised routes in air transportation,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.002,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Governments offer subsidies along routes that are deemed commercially non-viable but economically and socially essential. Subsidised routes are often criticised for inefficiencies and excessive subsidies, which partly result from restrictions defined by transportation authorities during the tendering process, such as a maximum airfare and minimum number of daily flights. We develop an integrated auction framework—referred to as Single-round Combinatorial Auction for Subsidised routes (SCAS)—to provide decision support to transportation authorities when designing tendering processes for subsidised routes. The framework includes two main models as ingredients. First, the Airline Bid Preparation Model (ABPM), which replicates the airline’s behaviour when preparing bids for subsidised routes. Second, the Winner Determination Problem (WDP), which is used to select the bids based on a given evaluation criterion. We capture the responsive relationship between passenger demand and supply of air services by including passenger utility as an endogenous variable in the ABPM. Additionally, as input to the ABPM, we estimate the route operating cost for small aircraft that typically operate subsidised routes. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated with an application to the network of subsidised routes in Sweden, for which we provide policy guidelines. Our analysis suggests that having a restriction on the airfare but not the number of flights is an effective way to design the tendering process, which strikes a good balance between passengers, government and airlines goals. Additionally, we demonstrate that the transportation authorities can compensate not having a requirement on the number of daily flights through ensuring a higher number of passengers, i.e., by including maximisation of the number of passengers in the bid evaluation criterion or using passenger discounts.",0965-8564,Not found
The influence of latent lifestyle on acceptance of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS): A hierarchical latent variable and latent class approach,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.020,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This paper aims to understand how people’s lifestyles are associated with their willingness to adopt a relatively new and innovative mobility solution, Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). The lifestyle is conceptualized as a combination of a mechanistic lifestyle manifested by an individual’s activity-travel patterns and a psychographic lifestyle depicted by an individual’s psychological traits. We propose a hierarchical latent variable and latent class model in which respondents are probabilistically allocated to one of the latent classes based upon mechanistic lifestyle, whereas psychographic lifestyle is incorporated in the model as values and personality traits exerting impact on attitudes which themselves are part of the utility function of MaaS subscription choice. The model is calibrated by the data emanated from a stated choice experiment and a lifestyle survey distributed among 1299 respondents in the Netherlands. The results confirm that psychographic lifestyles play a substantial role in people’s decision to subscribe to MaaS. Having positive attitudes towards multimodal travel increases the propensity to adopt MaaS, where the attitudes are moderated by values and personality traits significantly. Moreover, mechanistic lifestyles, having non car-oriented modality lifestyle in particular, enable to segment the respondents to two latent classes showing their preference heterogeneity.",0965-8564,Not found
Analyzing COVID-19’s impact on the travel mobility of various social groups in China's Greater Bay Area via mobile phone big data,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.015,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The COVID-19 outbreak has significantly impacted people’s mobility in terms of travel, which is directly related to regional economic vitality and individuals’ well-being. This study conducted research on the COVID-19 epidemic’s impact on travel mobility in China’s Greater Bay Area, utilizing mobile phone big data. The overall influence of COVID-19 was measured by investigating the impact between different income and migration groups in three core cities: Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Foshan. Individuals’ weekly travel frequency and activity space area between December 2019 and May 2020 were calculated, and the average values between the different cities and various social groups were compared. The results showed that travel mobility declined during the epidemic’s peak, followed by a recovery based on the overall trend. The start and end of strict law enforcement had a significant impact on the initial decline and subsequent recovery of travel mobility in the core cities. COVID-19 had a larger impact on core cities than peripheral areas, and on non-commute travel frequency, compared to commute travel frequency. Compared to advantaged groups, socially disadvantaged groups experienced a steeper decline in travel mobility during the epidemic’s peak, but a more significant recovery afterwards. These findings indicate that discretionary activities have not yet recovered and remain below the pre-epidemic level, and that disadvantaged social groups had limited access to superior precautionary measures for avoiding infection. Based on the findings, we provide several policy suggestions regarding the recovery of travel mobility.",0965-8564,Not found
Do teleworkers travel less? Evidence from the English National Travel Survey,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.026,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The global pandemic has revived debates about the contribution of teleworking to reducing travel, air pollution and carbon emissions. However, previous research suggests that the availability of teleworking may encourage people to move farther from their place of work, creating the risk that longer commutes will offset the benefits of fewer commutes. In addition, teleworking may encourage additional non-work travel by the teleworker, and/or influence the travel behaviour of other household members. These complex interactions make the overall impacts of teleworking difficult to predict. In this context, we use data from the English National Travel Survey to estimate the impact of teleworking on the travel patterns of English households over the period 2005–2019. We compare the number of trips and distance travelled by teleworkers each week with the number of trips and distance travelled by non-teleworkers, controlling for a range of socio-economic, demographic and regional variables. We estimate the impact of teleworking on travel by purpose (commuting, non-work and business) and by mode (car, public transport and active travel) and investigate the impact on the travel patterns of other household members. Our results provide little support for the claim that teleworking reduces travel. Indeed, after controlling for a range of variables, we find that the majority of English teleworkers travel farther each week than non-teleworkers. This results from a combination of longer commutes and additional non-work travel. There appears to be a ‘tipping point’, however. If people telework three or more times a week, their weekly private travel (commuting + non-work) is less than that of non-teleworkers. We also find that the total weekly travel of all household members is greater in households where one member is teleworking, suggesting the presence of intra-household effects that further erode the benefits of fewer commutes. We additionally find that teleworkers engage in more business travel than non-teleworkers, although the reasons for this association are unclear. We discuss the factors contributing to these results and indicate priorities for further research.",0965-8564,Not found
A validated agent-based model for stress testing charging infrastructure utilization,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.028,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Deployment and management of environmental infrastructures, such as charging infrastructure for Electric Vehicles (EV), is a challenging task. For policy makers, it is particularly difficult to estimate the capacity of current deployed public charging infrastructure for a given EV user population. While data analysis of charging data has shown added value for monitoring EV systems, it is not valid to linearly extrapolate charging infrastructure performance when increasing population size. We developed a data-driven agent-based model that can explore future scenarios to identify non-trivial dynamics that may be caused by EV user interaction, such as competition or collaboration, and that may affect performance metrics. We validated the model by comparing EV user activity patterns in time and space. We performed stress tests on the 4 largest cities the Netherlands to explore the capacity of the existing charging network. Our results demonstrate that (i) a non-linear relation exists between system utilization and inconvenience even at the base case; (ii) from 2.5x current population, the occupancy of non-habitual charging increases at the expense of habitual users, leading to an expected decline of occupancy for habitual users; and (iii) from a ratio of 0.6 non-habitual users to habitual users competition effects intensify. For the infrastructure to which the stress test is applied, a ratio of approximately 0.6 may indicate a maximum allowed ratio that balances performance with inconvenience. For policy makers, this implies that when they see diminishing marginal performance of KPIs in their monitoring reports, they should be aware of potential exponential increase of inconvenience for EV users.",0965-8564,Not found
The maximal covering bicycle network design problem,10.1016/j.tra.2022.02.004,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Considering the lack of adequate cycling infrastructure networks in many cities, decision makers must face the challenge of designing connected bicycle facility networks to ensure safe and comfortable access to urban opportunities for cyclists and the usability of infrastructure. This paper addresses the maximal covering bicycle network design problem (MCBNDP). MCBNDP involves making investment decisions to build a cycling network that is aimed at maximizing the coverage of cyclists, while maintaining a minimum total network cost at its minimum. The derived network is subject to a budget limit and accounts for the entire connectivity and directness as fundamental bicycle network design criteria. Cyclists who are located at a given origin are considered covered by the network if a connected path of dedicated cycling infrastructure links them to their desired destination, within a maximum travel distance. We propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, including a two-phase solution approach to solving the MCBNDP. In addition, using a commercial solver, our MILP formulation allows exact solutions to be obtained for large-scale instances with reasonable computing times for these types of problems. This MILP formulation is employed to solve a real instance that is applied to a wide territory of analysis in Medellin city (Colombia). The findings of this paper will contribute to existing literature and support urban policymakers to better spatially allocate the resources and, consequently, maximize the impact of their investments on connected cycling infrastructure networks. Our findings indicate that access to opportunities for cyclists can be easily favored by making small improvements to the existing infrastructure to guarantee safe, direct, and comfortable cycling infrastructure. Because we specify a maximum travel distance rather than a shortest path limitation, our problem ensures that cyclists may have several possibilities for their routes, which may go along the shortest path or any other alternative, however, without exceeding the maximum travel distance. In this direction, our findings confirm that prioritizing coverage, while accounting for full network connectivity, will benefit more cyclists because of the flexible configuration of the new network, which also may ensure its usability.",0965-8564,Not found
Prediction of population behavior in hurricane evacuations,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.001,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This study advances prediction of population evacuation behavior during hurricanes by comprehensively comparing five different models based on their practical utility for future hurricanes. The models—participation rate (PR-S), logistic regression (LR-S), random parameter logit (RPL), time-dependent Cox (TD-Cox), and dynamic discrete choice (DDC)—were fitted using population survey and hurricane data collected in a consistent format across four different hurricanes (Florence 2018, Michael 2018, Dorian 2019, and Barry 2019). Out-of-sample predictive power was evaluated in terms of prediction of total evacuation rates, spatial distribution of evacuees, evacuation timing, and individual behavior. The final set of predictors can be obtained for a whole region and applied in the future for prediction. The results suggest that if only an estimate of the total evacuation rate for the whole region is required, the LR-S is easiest to implement and provides good predictive power. However, if spatial and/or timing predictions are required, the DDC is recommended. The results suggest that in general, for future hurricanes, the best models currently available can estimate total evacuation rate within one to nine percentage points; evacuation rate for each county within 10 to 15 percentage points; and departure curve within several hours. Results also indicate that errors become smaller as geographic granularity increases.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper presents a planning-level model for jointly optimizing headways and zone sizes for flexible-route freight deliveries.

Then, the problem is reformulated as a Lagrangian relaxation problem to constrain the fleet size to an integer value. The proposed model and closed-form solutions provide direct insights into the relations affecting those decision variables. Results from the base case study and sensitivity analyses indicate how various factors affect optimal service frequencies, delivery zone sizes, and costs of freight deliveries. Before detailed vehicle routing problems (i.e., actual delivery scheduling and operations) are solved, the proposed model should be useful for planning freight delivery systems, regarding critical decisions about geographic coverage of services, delivery frequencies, vehicle capacities, and other system characteristics. The developed model can also be used for pickups with a many-to-one demand pattern and extended to serve many-to-many demand patterns in multiple delivery zones through transfers at a central terminal.",0965-8564,Not found

The primary focus of our proposed research effort is to develop a framework that provides a blueprint for airline demand recovery as COVID-19 cases evolve over time. Airline monthly demand data is sourced from Bureau of Transportation Statistics for 380 airports for 24 months from January 2019 through December 2020. The demand data is augmented with a host of independent variables including COVID-19 related factors, demographic characteristics and built environment characteristics at the county level, airport specific factors, spatial factors, temporal factors, and adjoining county attributes. The effect of COVID-19 related factors is identified by considering global and local COVID-19 transmission, temporal indicators of pandemic start and progress, and interactions of airline demand predictors with global and local COVID-19 indicators. Finally, we present a blueprint for airline demand recovery where we consider three hypothetical scenarios of COVID-19 transmission rates – expected, pessimistic and optimistic. The results at the airport level from these scenarios are aggregated at the state or regional level by adding the demand from all airports in the corresponding state or region. These trends are presented by State and Region to illustrate potential differences across various scenarios.

Then the pandemic disrupted medical and transportation systems across the globe. This research explored ways the COVID-19 pandemic changed how people experienced transportation barriers to accessing health care. We conducted in-depth interviews with social workers, nurses, and other care coordinators in North Carolina to identify barriers to traveling for medical care during the pandemic and explore innovative solutions employed to address these barriers. Analyzing these interviews using a flexible coding approach, we found that the pandemic exacerbated existing transportation barriers and created new barriers. Yet, simultaneously, temporary policy responses expanded the utilization of telehealth. The interviews identified specific advantages of expanded telehealth, including increasing access to mental health services in rural areas, reducing COVID-19 exposure for high-risk patients, and offering continuity of care for COVID-19 patients with other health conditions. While telehealth cannot address all medical needs, such as emergency or cancer care, it may be well-suited for preliminary screenings and follow-up visits.

"Estimation of crowding factors for public transport during the COVID-19 pandemic in Santiago, Chile",10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.011,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"A sharp decrease in public transport demand has been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic around the world. In this context, it is relevant to understand how mode preferences have changed since the surge of COVID-19. In order to better understand how the pandemic changed mode choice, particularly regarding the impact of crowding and face mask use in public transport, we conducted a stated preference on-line and on-street survey in Santiago, Chile. Our sample is balanced in gender but has a higher proportion of individuals with college degrees and those under 45 years of age than the population of Santiago. The data collected was then used to estimate two multinomial mode choice models, a latent class model and a mixed logit model with latent variables. The models yielded a value of travel time in crowded conditions (4 pax/m2) and low face mask use (50%) of 3.0–5.1 times higher than the case with low crowding (0.5 pax/m2) and 100% face mask use. Moreover, women tend to be more sensitive than men to the use of face masks in public transport. Besides, young and low-income people are relatively less sensitive to crowding. The crowding penalization obtained is higher than in pre-pandemic models calibrated for Santiago for similar passenger densities. Also, as we expected, it grows non-linearly with passenger density. Disinfection of vehicles, as well as the perception of health risk, cleanliness, safety and comfort, were also relevant in explaining mode choice. Further research shall discuss how the change of mode preferences together with new demand patterns influence the operational design of public transport services.",0965-8564,Not found
Determinants of purchase likelihood for partially and fully automated vehicles: Insights from mixed logit model with heterogeneity in means and variances,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.017,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Determining the likelihood of consumers purchasing automated vehicles (AVs) is extremely important for policymakers, researchers, and automobile manufacturers. Successful penetration of AVs into the market depends on the end-user’s perception and their affinity towards these vehicles. In this study, a comprehensive state-wide data has been used to determine the factors affecting the purchase likelihood of AVs. A wide range of potential factors are evaluated, including attributes related to safety and consumer’s perception, socio-economic and demographic factors, carsharing and ridesharing habits, types of housing and parking, types of owned and future vehicles, consumers’ preferences for buying or leasing a vehicle, and their residential region. A random parameters logit model with three outcomes of consumer’s affinity (i.e., agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree) towards purchasing either partially (Levels 3 and 4) or fully (Level 5) AVs is considered. Moreover, to account for different layers of unobserved heterogeneity and to obtain a better statistical fit, the means and variances of random parameters are allowed to vary across the observations. The estimations results reveal significant differences between the determinants of consumer’s affinity towards partially and fully AVs. For partially AVs, the effect of certain variables related to the status of owing hybrid vehicles, education level, parking type, gender, and consumer’s opinion about the future of carsharing and ridesharing programs represented significant degrees of heterogeneity. For fully AVs, however, variables related to education level, parking type, housing type, and ethnicity were found to produce random parameters. The findings from this study can be used to estimate AV penetration and promote AV adoption.",0965-8564,Not found
Mitigating traffic congestion induced by transportation network companies: A policy analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.017,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This paper analyzes and evaluates several policies aiming to mitigate the congestion effect a Transportation Network Company (TNC) brings to bear on an idealized city that contains a dense central core surrounded by a larger periphery. The TNC offers both solo and pooling e-hail services to the users of public transport. We develop a spatial market equilibrium model over two building blocks: an aggregate congestion model that describes the traffic impact of TNC operations on all travelers in the city, including private motorists, and a matching model that estimates the TNC’s level of service based on the interactions between riders and TNC drivers. Based on the equilibrium model, we formulate and solve the optimal pricing problem, in which the TNC seeks to optimize its profit or social welfare subject to regulatory costs and/or constraints. Three congestion mitigation policies are implemented in this study: (i) a trip-based policy that charges a congestion fee on each solo trip starting or ending in the city center; (ii) a cordon-based policy that charges TNC vehicles entering the city center with zero or one passenger; and (iii) a cruising cap policy that requires the TNC to maintain the fleet utilization ratio in the city center above a threshold. Based on a case study of Chicago, we find TNC operations may have a significant congestion effect. Failing to anticipate this effect in the pricing problem leads to sub-optimal decisions that worsen traffic congestion and hurt the TNC’s profitability. Of the three policies, the trip-based policy delivers the best performance. It reduces traffic congestion modestly, keeps the TNC’s level of service almost intact, and improves overall social welfare substantially. The cruising cap policy benefits private motorists, thanks to the extra congestion relief it brings about. However, because other stakeholders together suffer a much greater loss, its net impact on social welfare is negative. Paradoxically, the policy could worsen the very traffic conditions in the city center that it is designed to improve.",0965-8564,Not found
The role of bike sharing during the coronavirus pandemic: An analysis of the mobility patterns and perceptions of Lisbon's GIRA users,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.018,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"COVID-19 has dramatically impacted urban mobility, of which public transport (PT) has been particularly affected. With PT ridership plummeting due to infection fears and many people returning to work, there is a danger of a steep rise in car use that would exacerbate environmental and health problems. Therefore, other modes such as bike sharing should be considered as potential alternatives during the coronavirus pandemic. This study focuses on assessing how coronavirus has impacted bike sharing by implementing a travel behaviour survey to the users of GIRA, the bike sharing system (BSS) of Lisbon. While the coronavirus has led some to decrease the frequency of use or quit the system, other users have increased the usage or joined GIRA during the pandemic. Furthermore, most users who have quit or decreased the usage of GIRA justify their decision not so much on avoiding the risk of infection (although for some it is an important reason) but on having stopped commuting due to COVID-19. The survey has also revealed substantial changes not only on the usage patterns of GIRA users but also on their relationship with other modes of transport. While before the pandemic, most respondents were shifting from PT to GIRA, that percentage has declined, with an increase on the share of users replacing walking, private car, and personal cycling. Moreover, the motivations for using bike sharing related with avoiding PT and maintaining a social distance during the trip have gained more relevance. Concurrently, the perceived safety of using PT has drastically declined, and while the perceived safety of using GIRA has also decreased it was in a much smaller scale. Policy insights can be derived from this research on how bike sharing can contribute to a more sustainable and resilient urban transport system. During infectious public health crises such as COVID-19, BSS can be a viable transport alternative, not only providing the population with an affordable mode of transport where social distancing can be maintained in most of the trip but also mitigating a modal shift from PT to the private car.",0965-8564,Not found
Ensuring equitable transportation for the disadvantaged: Paratransit usage by persons with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.013,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Paratransit services developed under the Americans with Disabilities Act are a critical transportation means for persons with disabilities to meet their basic needs, but the COVID-19 pandemic posed an unprecedented challenge to service providers. To safeguard transportation equity, this study used complete records of service trips and riders obtained from the Access Transportation Program in the Seattle region for an empirical analysis aimed at answering two research questions. First, how did the ridership and trip purposes of paratransit change after the outbreak of COVID-19? Second, what factors explained the users’ changing levels of service usage in response to the pandemic? Statistical methods, including a Hurdle model, were employed as the analytical tools. The results show that paratransit ridership dramatically decreased during 2020 with the most substantial reductions of working and non-essential personal trips, and that most of the remaining trips were for medical purposes. The results also indicate that riders’ service usage during the pandemic was associated with their sociodemographic characteristics, disability conditions, and pre-pandemic travel demand. When controlling for other factors, riders who lived in neighborhoods with lower income and lower access to personal vehicles were more dependent on the service. Based on the empirical findings, we recommend that when developing plans for future disruptive events, public transit agencies should promptly implement safety measures, identify and prioritize neighborhoods that are most in need of mobility services, and actively pursue collaboration with other organizations for innovative service delivery options.",0965-8564,Not found
"Teleworking during COVID-19 in the Netherlands: Understanding behaviour, attitudes, and future intentions of train travellers",10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.019,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"With the arrival of COVID-19 in the Netherlands in Spring 2020 and the start of the “intelligent lockdown”, daily life changed drastically. The working population was urged to telework as much as possible. However, not everyone had a suitable job for teleworking or liked teleworking. From a mobility perspective, teleworking was considered a suitable means to alleviate travel. Even after the pandemic it can (continue to) reduce pressure on the mobility system during peak hours, thereby improving efficiency and level of service of transport services. Additionally, this could reduce transport externalities, such as emissions and unsafety. The structural impact from teleworking offers opportunities, but also challenges for the planning and operations of public transport. The aim of this study is to better understand teleworking during and after COVID-19 among train travellers, to support operators and authorities in their policy making and design. We study the telework behaviour, attitude towards teleworking, and future intentions through a longitudinal data collection. By applying a latent class cluster analysis, we identified six types of teleworkers, varying in their frequency of teleworking, attitude towards teleworking, intentions to the future, socio-demographics and employer policy. In terms of willingness-to-telework in the future, we distinguish three groups: the high willingness-to-telework group (71%), the low willingness-to-telework group (16%), and the least-impacted self-employed (12%). Those with high willingness are expected to have lasting changes in their travel patterns, where especially public transport is impacted. For this group, policy is required to ensure when (which days) and where (geographical) telework takes place, such that public transport operators can better plan and operate their services. For those with low willingness, it is essential that the government provides tools to companies (especially in education and vital sector) such that they can be better prepared for teleworking (mostly during but also after the pandemic). Employers on the other hand need to better support their employees, such that they stay in contact with colleagues and their concentration and productivity can increase.",0965-8564,Not found
Moving past sustainable transport studies: Towards a critical perspective on urban transport,10.1016/j.tra.2022.02.008,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This article introduces a virtual special issue that carries the same title. We open our editorial by observing that the contemporary transport debate continues to find strong inspiration in the notion of “sustainable” development, which strongly resonates among academics and practitioners alike. While placing important environmental issues on the agenda, sustainable approaches to urban transport exhibit a number of serious limitations, as, as it has insufficiently engaged with diverse social, political and economic dynamics that shape how transport is planned, regulated, organised, practiced and contested in urban contexts. To respond to this gap, we propose to develop an emerging “critical” perspective on urban transport, which considers it it to be socially constructed and contested, underpinned by structural power dynamics, class relations, gender and patriarchy, ethnicity and race. Building on critical urban theory, we argue that being critical about urban transport involves approaching it as a phenomenon that reproduces complex social and spatial processes, and acts as a crucial component of capitalism. On the one hand, this means analysing transport policy, practice and infrastructure through the lens of capitalist dynamics observed in particular urban contexts. On the other, it entails exploring the complexity of processes, institutions and interests that make up a city through its transport. While critical research on transport and mobility may be on the rise, it still constitutes a rather marginal research area. Therefore, the objective of the virtual special issue is to advance the critical agenda of transport research. The diverse contributions to this virtual special issue offer a number of avenues for thinking critically with and through urban transport as part and parcel of capitalism. Our authors discuss theoretical and methodological frameworks for studying transport, and offer empirical analyses of specific policies and practices, inquiring into their socio-spatial impact, political-economic embeddedness and the power relations and regulatory frameworks by which they are shaped. What emerges from this anthology is that there is no singular or universal way of being critical about urban transport. Unravelling and analysing power and ideology underpinned and reproduced by transport in urban settings is by no means an exercise that hinges on a particular theoretical lens or focuses on a specific social group or factor. As this endavour is far from complete, we outline several directions for further critical research. Notably, we suggest to diversify spaces and scales of analysis by exploring long-distance travel, to diversify research objects by analysing freight and logistics. We also note that future research could consider diversifying social theories and epistemologies through which transport is perceived, to contribute to a decolonial turn in transport studies.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact of working from home on activity-travel behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An aggregate structural analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.003,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns that led the public and private sectors to impose stay-at-home and work-from-home policies. Although working from home has been a conventional albeit infrequent behavior, the prevalence of this option was significantly and rapidly accelerated during the pandemic. This study explored the impacts of working from home on activity-travel behavior during the pandemic. Both work and non-work activity participation declined during the pandemic but to what extent was this due to working from home? How did working from home affect other measures of travel such as person-miles traveled? We approached these questions by developing a Structural Regression model and using cross-sectional data for the early phase of the pandemic when the infection curve was flattened and activity-travel behavior became relatively stable following the drastic changes observed during the pandemic’s initial shock. Combining U.S. county-level data from the Maryland Transportation Institute and Google Mobility Reports, we concluded that the proportion of people working from home directly depended on pandemic severity and associated public health policies as well as on a range of socio-economic characteristics. Working from home contributed to a reduction in workplace visits. It also reduced non-work activities but only via a reduction in non-work activities linked to work. Finally, a higher working from home proportion in a county corresponded to a reduction in average person-miles traveled. A higher degree of state government responses to containment and closure policies contributed to an increase in working from home, and decreases in workplace and non-workplace visits and person-miles traveled in a county. The results of this study provide important insights into changes in activity-travel behavior associated with working from home as a response strategy to major disruptions such as those imposed by a pandemic.",0965-8564,Not found
Role of stay-at-home requests and travel restrictions in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in Japan,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.009,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"COVID-19 is one of the worst global health crises in a century. Japan confirmed its first case of COVID-19 in mid-January and declared a state of emergency in April and May 2020, urging people to stay at home and reduce travel. Using Mobile Spatial Statistics (i.e., population statistics created from operational data of mobile terminal networks), we estimated daily intra- and inter-prefectural population mobility in the Tokyo Megalopolis Region, Japan in 2020. Then, we developed a compartmental model with population mobility to explore the role of stay-at-home requests and travel restrictions in preventing the spread of COVID-19. This model describes the COVID-19 pandemic through a susceptible-exposed-presymptomatic infectious-undocumented and documented infectious-removed (SEPIR) process and incorporates intra- and inter-prefectural population mobility into the transmission process. We found that people significantly reduced travel during the state of emergency, although stay-at-home requests and travel restrictions were recommended rather than mandatory. The reduction in population mobility, combined with other control measures, resulted in a substantial reduction in effective reproduction numbers to below 1, thus controlling the first wave of the pandemic. Moreover, the relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 transmission changed over time. The dampening of the second wave of the pandemic indicated that smaller reductions in population mobility could result in pandemic control, probably because of other social distancing behaviors. Our proposed model can be used to analyze the impact of different public health interventions, and our findings shed light on the effectiveness of soft containments in curbing the spread of COVID-19.",0965-8564,Not found
High-Speed rail and the knowledge economy: Evidence from Japan,10.1016/j.tra.2022.01.019,159,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This study investigates the impact of high-speed rail (HSR) on regional innovation through an empirical analysis that uses municipal-level panel data covering all 1,741 municipalities in Japan, and spanning the period from 1976 to 2016. The study assumes that the number of patent applications serves as a proxy for regional innovation and follows a negative binomial distribution. A difference-in-differences specification with multiple timeframes is employed for the empirical analysis. The results reveal that HSR development has had a significant positive effect on regional innovation, supporting the companion innovation hypothesis. Robustness checks, such as through combining propensity score matching and the instrumental variable methods with difference-in-differences analysis, are also conducted. The results suggest that the effect of HSR on regional innovation in small towns and villages is larger than that in large cities. This implies that inter-regional communication opportunities for employees could play a key role in fostering innovation in small rural areas.",0965-8564,Not found
Consumer preferences for operator collaboration in intra- and intercity transport ecosystems: Institutionalising platforms to facilitate MaaS 2.0,10.1016/j.tra.2022.04.013,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"The presence of institutional mechanisms to facilitate collaborative activities between operators, and consumer preferences for these activities, have not been studied in the public transport context. Exploring preferences in both intracity and intercity transport options (incorporating long distance transport components such as air services), we use random parameters logit models to analyse integrated travel choice experiments. We show that consumers have preferences for attributes resulting from operator collaboration that can deliver them better door-to-door travel options across the whole transport ecosystem, both in their own city but just as importantly, when travelling to another city. Our results suggest that the proposed method of institutional integration (MaaS 2.0 or CaaS) creates better value for respondents, such that they would be more likely to engage with integrated transport solutions rather than the default option for many, which is the car. Consumers are willing to pay for collaboration activities that inherently arise out of institutionally facilitated interaction between operators and that lead to improvements in their journey. Expansion of institutional integration such as that which may be possible through smart ticketing platforms as an institutional coordination mechanism may facilitate greater development of these features and lead to more integrated travel being chosen by consumers.",0965-8564,Not found
Methodology for the feasibility assessment of an eco-transfer system,10.1016/j.tra.2022.04.002,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"With outdated parking space, land use and curbside management practices rampant in dense urban areas, researchers and practitioners over the past decade have proposed several innovative schemes to encourage a shift in urban delivery and logistics behavior. The success of such schemes, however, has proven more challenging than anticipated, as it depends on accounting for a myriad of factors. This research proposes a methodology to assess the feasibility of implementing a successful Eco-Transfer System (ETS) initiative. An ETS consists of transfer locations for transferring goods between large vehicles and sustainable city-scaled modes, such as cargo cycles and hand carts, for urban delivery. The methodology considers a supply–demand quantification, together with a study on market conditions and infrastructure requirements, as well as a legal framework investigation. The methodology was used for the case of New York City (NYC). The results indicate that an Eco-Transfer System in NYC could be implemented successfully under certain conditions. The city has features, such as its geography and demand, that are appropriate for the system to succeed. The market conditions also foreshadow its success.

Stick or carrot for traffic demand management? Evidence from experimental economics,10.1016/j.tra.2022.04.010,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"The debate between stick (penalties) and carrot (rewards) strategies has been widely carried out in various academic realms, including transportation. This paper seeks to compare the instantaneous and longitudinal effectiveness of a traditional penalty-based congestion pricing strategy and an innovative Incentive-Based Traffic Demand Management (IBTDM) strategy using an online interactive laboratory experiment focused on departure time choice. We also investigate the social-economic phenomena of loss aversion and risk aversion. The experimental results show that penalties and rewards can both positively induce sustainable travel behavior. The stronger demand-shifting performance of the penalty-based strategy at first demonstrates that ‘loss aversion’ does exist in TDM, at least initially. However, this loss aversion weakens as the experiment continues, which verifies the myopic loss aversion theory. Moreover, risky decision-making in the gambling games proves the existence of risk seeking, which violates the ‘certainty effect’. To overcome the disadvantage of laboratory experiment that participants need to accomplish the experiment all in once for considerably long time, an agent-based model is calibrated based on real participants’ behavior to further verify the long-term effectiveness of penalties and rewards, and to verify the effectiveness of other optimized penalty/reward schemes. The simulated results based on the agent-based model indicate that the theoretical optimal penalty scheme performs better in general in congestion alleviation, while a more reasonable reward scheme that considers psychological factors can achieve the same effectiveness in terms of total system travel time reduction. The findings of this research can be used to guide the design of TDM strategies, and the behavioral data collection approach based on our laboratory experiment is portable for future studies.",0965-8564,Not found
Quantifying the consumer's dependence on different information sources on acceptance of autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2022.04.009,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Recent academic research and industrial commitments highlight the potential of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in transforming the way we travel. However, there are some anticipated barriers associated with the widespread consumer adoption of CAVs, including but not limited to low user acceptance, cybersecurity, safety, and legislation. The existing literature is non-existent in capturing the impact of information received from multiple sources (peers, car dealers, media advertisements, and personal research) on the consumers’ acceptance of CAVs while considering these barriers associated with CAV. In this direction, we quantify the impact of the multiple information sources on the individuals concerned and indifferent about the anticipated barriers of CAVs to boost their acceptance while utilizing a two-step econometric framework based on an online survey of 4,448 Tennesseans. The two-step modeling framework utilizes latent class analysis followed by a multivariate ordered logit model. Results indicated that the elderly, three or more person households, and residents interested in owning a CAV are more likely to be concerned about CAV barriers. In contrast, males, physically challenged, and residents willing to pay higher for CAV are more likely to be indifferent toward CAV barriers. Among concerned individuals, the elderly, females, and residents willing to pay more than $30 k for a conventional car are more likely to rely on car dealers when purchasing a CAV. The results of this study are expected to assist automakers, technology companies, policymakers, and third-party agencies to advertise, promote and introduce CAVs effectively through appropriate information channel(s) to boost their consumer acceptance.",0965-8564,Not found

Many-to-one stable matching for taxi-sharing service with selfish players,10.1016/j.tra.2022.04.012,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"In taxi-sharing, matching problems can be divided into two parts, i.e., passenger-to-taxi matches and passenger-to-passenger matches. Considering of the selfishness of passengers and taxi drivers, attention needs to be devoted to their preferences over matching partners. In this paper, the concept of the scheme is introduced as a medium to formulate the preferences of passengers and taxi drivers. A stable matching framework is first designed to model the matching problem of taxi-sharing service with peer effect. A branch-and-price algorithm is tailored to solve the many-to-one stable matching problem. Dalian taxi data are used to assess the performance of the proposed model and algorithm. The results indicate that the variable discount strategy is a useful tool to balance the demand and supply. The matching rate of taxis increases by an average of 5.39% compared with the fixed discount strategy. Furthermore, when the taxi-sharing reaches a high level of participation, the benefit received from expanding the service space of taxis from a 3-min drive to a 10-min drive is limited. However, a relaxed preference rule could increase the matching rate of passengers by 25.6%.

Using a hybrid choice model (HCM), the empirical results obtained from 1546 Chinese consumers reveal that PCT and TDC are more powerful than most existing policy instruments in encouraging consumers to adopt electric vehicles (EVs). Moreover, although psychological characteristics (i.e., environmental awareness, perceived environmental benefits, and subjective norms) play an important role in explaining consumers’ EV adoption behaviour, PCT and TDC primarily alter consumers’ EV adoption decisions through economic motivations rather than through psychological motivations. Most importantly, the implementation of PCT and TDC enables consumers to adopt EVs while having no substantial impact on their intention to purchase conventional fuel vehicles (CFVs), thereby laying the groundwork for PCT and TDC to function effectively. This paper contributes to the EV adoption literature by systematically investigating the combined effects of different factors, especially market-oriented policy instruments, on consumers’ vehicle adoption decisions.

Estimating the benefits of dedicated unloading bays by field experimentation,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.023,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"In most dense urban environments in emerging markets, retail deliveries are very fragmented to thousands of nanostores. It is not uncommon for a delivery route to include more than 60 stops. Unloading bays are often blocked by regular traffic. Due to the complex urban environment, it is difficult to estimate the benefits of making unloading bays available. In this study, we conduct a field experiment in an urban field lab of one square kilometer in the downtown of Querétaro, Mexico. During the treatment period of one week, we obtain help from the local traffic police to keep the unloading bays available for unloading only. Using advanced GPS devices and extensive manual field observations, we are able to capture the change in driver behavior and the direct efficiency increases. We find a high efficiency gain, not only in travel time (39%) but also – remarkably – in the total time parked (17%). Corrected for other effects, we estimate a gain of about 44% in total time per delivery. Apart from the insights on unloading benefits, we also provide insights into the method of field experimentation in such a complex environment.",0965-8564,Not found

Those monetary values have been based on individual-level characteristics. To date, the influence of place, or neighbourhood, on risk of social exclusion and on the associated value of trip making by at-risk people has not been considered. This paper adds a measure of neighbourhood to individual factors to explore risk of social exclusion and then shows how the monetary value of additional trips varies by level of social exclusion risk.",0965-8564,Not found
Dynamic ride-sharing impacts of greater trip demand and aggregation at stops in shared autonomous vehicle systems,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.032,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Sharing vehicles and rides may become the norm with public use of fully-automated self-driving vehicles in the near future, assuming pandemic-related health concerns fade. Dynamic ride-sharing (DRS) or ride-pooling of trips can significantly improve system performance by lowering empty vehicle-miles traveled (eVMT) and increasing average vehicle occupancy (AVO). With several cities looking to promote efficient curb space use, especially with the use of pickup and drop-off locations (PUDOs), this study explores the impacts of PUDOs on DRS rates and AVO values. Various PUDO spacings and trip-demand densities were studied, across the Bloomington, Illinois region, using the agent-based simulator POLARIS. Results reveal that greater PUDO spacing or distances between stops and higher levels of SAV use or trip demand increase AVO (by up to 20% per 4-seater SAV, on average) and decrease SAV VMT (by up to 27%) compared to door-to-door SAV fleet operations without DRS or PUDOs. A quarter-mile PUDO spacing is recommended in downtown regions, similar to current transit stop spacing, to keep walking trips short and demand relatively high. At 0.25 mi PUDO spacings (thoughtfully placed, using origin and destination clusters), travelers walked less than 5 min at either trip end, on average, while 0.5 mi spacings led to another 1 min (approximately) of walking. More evenly distributed and higher SAV demand can save up to 39% total VMT from use of DRS and PUDO stops. It is also important to prepare for queuing areas at PUDOs in settings of high trip density, to limit curbside congestion.",0965-8564,Not found
Optimal location of bike-sharing stations: A built environment and accessibility approach,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.022,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Bike-sharing systems (BSS) have arisen worldwide as an attractive and sustainable travel alternative. As these systems have shown positive effects in reducing congestion and emissions, it is relevant to properly analyze their potential implementation in different contexts. Evidence has shown that BSS can only provide benefits when their network is adequately designed, in order to capture ridership and generate demand. This study proposes an integrated approach to model the demand of bike-sharing trips and the optimal location of stations in the system, based on built environment and accessibility-based variables. The methodology consists of two steps. On the first step, trip generation models are estimated through multiple regressions for different types of trips and periods of the week. On the second step, maximum demand coverage models are developed to allocate the BSS stations, according to the trip generation models and to different proposed scenarios. To test the proposed methodology, information from the BSS of Santiago de Chile is used. Results suggest a relationship between the built environment and the use of public bicycles, with a main effect of residential and office land uses, and the presence of long bicycle lanes near the stations. In addition, the presence of endogeneity, associated with the location of BSS stations and BSS demand generation, is confirmed and controlled using accessibility variables. As for the optimal location models, their outcomes differ significantly from the observed spatial distribution of stations in Santiago, with higher density in central areas and along corridors with cycling infrastructure. The forecasted demand level for the optimal distribution of stations is 64% higher than the observed demand. This study confirms the benefit of an integrated modelling of the trip generation and the station location to foster higher public bicycle usage, a relevant point for BSS decision planning and the promotion of a more sustainable mobility.",0965-8564,Not found
A structural analysis of the work tour behavior of transit commuters,10.1016/j.tra.2022.04.003,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Our knowledge of complex travel behavior associated with transit commuting is limited. While chaining activities into tours has been a frequent behavior of travelers in general, and in some cases of work commuters, it is unclear how successful public transit has been in providing the accessibility that is needed to link multiple activities, especially on work tours. To address this knowledge gap, a structural model was developed for transit commuters, which allows for the characterization of commuters based on the complexity of work tours and an assessment of the influence of household and person-level socio-demographic characteristics, built environment variables, and activity-travel demand on tour complexity. Using data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, this study’s results suggested that married men with no children and high vehicle ownership living in low-density areas tend to make simple work tours while single women with children who live in high-density neighborhoods were more likely to make complex work tours. Also, white men with higher incomes and higher education living in denser areas were more likely to make complex tours with work-based sub-tours. Denser residential neighborhoods, flexible work schedules, and vehicle availability on work tours were observed to increase the propensity of making complex tours. The findings of this study can assist transit agencies or planning organizations in identifying transit commuters who have complex travel needs or whose circumstances hold potential to yield greater benefits from transit usage in work tours and thus to formulate policies directed at better work and non-work travel and activity linkages.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact analysis of actual traveling performance on bus passenger's perception and satisfaction,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.029,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Customer satisfaction has always been a pivotal indicator of public transport service quality. However, most existing studies on public transport satisfaction focused on passenger perception without considering the actual traveling performance. Thus, whether passenger perception veritably reflects the actual performance remains to be investigated. This paper adopts the gradient boosting decision trees approach to reveal the relationship between actual on-board performance and passenger satisfaction driven by individual perception. The work utilizes a mixed dataset combining customer satisfaction survey (CSS) with actual traveling data collected in Shijiazhuang, China. Instead of a direct equivalence, the results indicate the complex non-linear relationship between passenger perception and actual on-board performance. These findings enable deriving strategies for administrators and operators to improve the public transport service quality and customer satisfaction in a more effective and targeted way.",0965-8564,Not found
Preferences for using the London Underground during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.033,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted people’s travel behaviour and introduced uncertainty in the demand for public transport. To investigate user preferences for travel by London Underground during the pandemic, we conducted a stated choice experiment among its pre-pandemic users (N = 961). We analysed the collected data using multinomial and latent class logit models. Our discrete choice analysis provides two sets of results. First, we derive the crowding multiplier estimate of travel time valuation (i.e., the ratio of the value of travel time in uncrowded and crowded situations) for London underground users. The results indicate that travel time valuation of Underground users increases by 73% when it operates at technical capacity. Second, we estimate the sensitivity of the preference for the London Underground relative to the epidemic situation (confirmed new COVID-19 cases) and interventions (vaccination rates and mandatory face masks). The sensitivity analysis suggests that making face masks mandatory is a main driver for recovering the demand for the London underground. The latent class model reveals substantial preference heterogeneity. For instance, while the average effect of mandatory face masks is positive, the preferences of 30% of pre-pandemic users for travel by the Underground are negatively affected. The positive effect of mandatory face masks on the likelihood of taking the Underground is less pronounced among males with age below 40 years, and a monthly income below 10,000 GBP. The estimated preference sensitivities and crowding multipliers are relevant for supply–demand management in transit systems and the calibration of advanced epidemiological models.",0965-8564,Not found
The spatial planning of public electric vehicle charging infrastructure in a high-density city using a contextualised location-allocation model,10.1016/j.tra.2022.02.012,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"The optimal deployment of public charging infrastructure is critical to the popularisation of electric vehicles (EVs) in high-density cities. Existing studies on public EV charging facilities have rarely integrated government policy and spatial constraints into their optimisation algorithms. To address this research gap, we proposed a contextualised EV charger optimisation model that incorporates carefully derived supply-and-demand constraints and tested it in the case of Hong Kong. From the supply side, we studied the latest planning guidelines and conducted a spatial analysis of potential charging sites. From the demand side, we conducted a questionnaire survey with local residents, estimated their EV purchase intention using a generalised ordered probit model, and then projected the usage demand for public chargers. These supply-and-demand constraints were subsequently incorporated into a location-allocation model to minimise both charging demand shortfall and travel time to charging facilities. We also conducted sensitivity analyses with varying budget, charging demand and facility service radius. Based on our results, we made several key recommendations regarding the spatial planning of public EV charging facilities in our high-density context: (1) the existing charging network should be substantially expanded to meet the projected demand; (2) the charging network should be expanded beyond the central business district and the urban core into other urban neighbourhoods and suburbs; and (3) installing more chargers at existing charging stations is more economical than building new stations. Our research provides an important reference for the spatial planning and deployment strategies for public EV charging infrastructure in high-density cities.",0965-8564,Not found
Shippers’ willingness to use flexible transportation services,10.1016/j.tra.2022.03.031,160,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Factors driving the choice of shipper firms for services of logistics service providers have long been recognized in the freight transportation literature. However, the willingness among shippers to choose flexible transportation services, where the service package can be adapted during planning and execution, has received less attention. In particular, little is known about the contextual circumstances under which shippers would be inclined to select such flexible transportation service. In this study, experimental scenarios and discrete choice modeling are used to investigate the willingness among shippers to use flexible transportation services. We estimate multinomial logit, mixed logit, and latent class models for a sample of nearly 200 global shipper firms and calculate willingness-to-pay measures for flexibility. The findings indicate that flexible services are essential in demand-volatile markets. Since logistics services may provide external flexibility for shipper firms, we also study which related internal flexibilities in supply chains drive these choices. In particular, our findings show that it is mainly the volume flexibility of shippers that mediates the choice of flexible transportation services.",0965-8564,Not found
A data-driven traffic modeling for analyzing the impacts of a freight departure time shift policy,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.008,161,2022-07-01,2022,7,"This paper proposes a data-driven transport modeling framework to assess the impact of freight departure time shift policies. We develop and apply the framework around the case of the port of Rotterdam. Container transport demand data and traffic data from the surrounding network are used as inputs. The model is based on a graph convolutional deep neural network that predicts traffic volume, speed, and vehicle loss hours in the system with high accuracy. The model allows us to quantify the benefits of different degrees of adjustment of truck departure times towards the off-peak hours. In our case, travel time reductions over the network are possible up to 10%. Freight demand management can build on the model to design departure time advisory schemes or incentive schemes for peak avoidance by freight traffic. These measures may improve the reliability of road freight operations as well as overall traffic conditions on the network.",0965-8564,Not found
An empirical Bayes approach to quantifying the impact of transportation network companies (TNCs) operations on travel demand,10.1016/j.tra.2022.04.008,161,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Assessing the impacts of new and disruptive technologies on the transportation system is crucial for planners and policymakers. This study offers an innovative method for estimating the impact of transportation network company (TNC, e.g., Uber and Lyft) operations on travel demand. Among various measures of travel demand, vehicle‐miles traveled (VMT) is tested due to its broad applications in evaluating changes in transportation policy. The evaluation is based on counterfactual theory, which compares VMT estimates after the TNCs introduction to a region to what the VMT would have been without the TNCs. The latter of the two is a counterfactual, and this study develops and demonstrates the empirical Bayes (EB) approach for obtaining counterfactual VMT estimates. The EB approach is widely used to estimate crash frequency after a particular traffic safety treatment is applied to a roadway location. We reinterpret the traffic safety treatment as being akin to the introduction of TNCs in the Atlanta region and the estimation of crash frequency as analogous to the resulting change in VMT. Since the crash experience of a roadway site may be affected by several factors, like the VMT of a region, a robust counterfactual estimate is necessary for conducting a before-after study. A counterfactual VMT estimate is obtained by combining two VMT estimates from 1) the cross‐sectional analysis for Atlanta and its regional peers and 2) the time-series analysis based on the longitudinal trend from the Atlanta region. We measure the difference between the counterfactual VMT estimate and the reported VMT estimate as an indicator of TNC impact. We find that the VMT estimates in a counterfactual scenario without TNCs are lower than the actual VMT estimates between 2012 and 2018. We estimate that the TNCs may be accounting for extra 0.6 percent average annual growth in VMT. The findings may support future TNC-related planning and policymaking. We expect the approach to be useful in estimating the effects of other disruptions, such as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) introduction and lasting impact of the pandemic, on VMT.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact of large-scale activities on macroscopic fundamental diagram: Field data analysis and modeling,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.018,161,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Large-scale activities always have serious impacts on regional traffic states. It is necessary for traffic planners to investigate the characteristics of network traffic flow under large-scale activities and apply proper management strategies.

The study area is divided into the inner area and the outer area. Based on the work of Haddad (2012) on the traffic perimeter control in two-region, a dynamic model is calibrated by the empirical data in Tianjin to study the influences of activities and control strategies. Based on the calibrated model, different control strategies are simulated to investigate the impacts on regional traffic flow. The results show that decreasing the transfer flow from the outer area will alleviate the congestion in the inner area effectively, and increasing the system outflow will reduce the densities of both two areas effectively. When the traffic states are already congested, the real control strategies cannot alleviate the congestion of the regional network effectively. According to the various impacts of different strategies, combined control strategies are proposed to mitigate the adverse impact of large-scale activities on the surrounding area.",0965-8564,Not found

This research makes a significant contribution to the analysis of the spatiotemporal impacts of transit systems by quantifying variations in the spatial distribution of causal effects from project announcement to long-run operation. The study develops a quasi-experimental framework based on advanced difference-in-differences specifications that enable us to capture the distribution of average treatment effects in space and time. The methodology is applied to the light rail system in Charlotte, NC, which includes an original line and its extension. A dataset comprised of the single-family house sales from the last thirty years is compiled for the study area, which contains neighborhoods in the vicinity of the light rail and two comparison areas. The estimated impacts demonstrate significant heterogeneity, on multiple facets. We find that although the shape of the spatial distribution of effects changes over time experiencing increasing curvature, the results consistently indicate highest positive impacts for properties located within 0.25 and 0.5 miles of a transit station. Differential effects are also identified between the original light rail line and its extension, such as lack of anticipation effects for the line extension.

This paper investigates the impact of UK financial purchase incentives on new registrations of electric fleets whilst moderating for change in gross domestic product (GDP). We use a unique dataset of new registrations of electric fleets in the UK for a 20-year period (1999–2019). Our results show that financial purchase incentives positively impact new registrations of electric fleets, and this effect is positively moderated by GDP change. Marginal analysis reveals three categories of adopters that purchase electric fleets at different levels of policy and GDP change: insensitive adopters, standard adopters, and sensitive adopters. Overall, financial incentives may be more effective in fostering the adoption of electric fleets when set to levels that are conditioned on the level of GDP change.

Perceived usefulness and intentions to adopt autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.007,161,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Understanding the mental process of public acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is important to the prediction and change of adoption behavior. We present a conceptual model to incorporate background factors such as demographic variables and travel behaviors attributes to the understanding of AV perceived usefulness and intention to adopt AVs. Using data from the 2019 California Vehicle Survey (CVS), we investigate the relationships between observed and latent variables with regard to AV acceptance via structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. The results show that perceived usefulness is an important determinant of behavioral intention. Householders who are young, well-educated, and males perceive higher usefulness of AVs than other population segments. Households that have telecommuters, transit riders, transportation network company (TNC; e.g., Uber & Lyft) riders, and electric vehicles (EVs) owners, and households that own or plan to install photovoltaic cell (solar) panels also anticipate high benefits of AVs. Living or working at places with access to infrastructure such as EV charging stations and hydrogen fueling stations also add to positive perception of AVs’ advantages. Controlling for perceived usefulness, households having higher annual income and EVs express a stronger interest in buying an AV but not in ridesharing. Young educated households with more TNC riders show a greater propensity to AV sharing services but not for owning AVs. The proposed conceptual model can help pinpoint how background factors such as socioeconomic status affects behavioral intention via its antecedent cognitive construct more accurately to represent the mental process of intention formation.

Optimizing operational strategies for mass transit systems in response to a global pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.006,161,2022-07-01,2022,7,"This study analyzes the risk involved in riding various transit modes during and after a global pandemic. The goal is to identify which factors are related to this risk, how such a relationship can be represented in a manner amenable to analysis, and what a transit operator can do to mitigate the risk while running its service as efficiently as possible. The resulting infection risk model is sensitive to such factors as prevalence of infection, baseline transmission probability, social distance, and expected number of human contacts. Built on this model, we formulate, analyze and test three versions of a transit operator’s design problem. In the first, the operator seeks to jointly optimize vehicle capacity and staff testing frequency while keeping the original service schedule and satisfying a predefined infection risk requirement. The second model assumes the operator is obligated to meet the returning demand after the peak of the pandemic. The third allows the operator to run more than one transit line and to allocate limited resources between the lines, subject to the penalty of unserved passengers. We find: (i) The optimal profit, as well as the testing frequency and the vehicle capacity, decreases when passengers expect to come in close contact with more fellow riders in a trip; (ii) Using a larger bus and/or reducing the testing cost enables the operator to both test drivers more frequently and allow more passengers in each bus; (iii) If passengers weigh the risk of riding bus relative to taxi, a higher prevalence of infection has a negative effect on transit operation, whereas a higher baseline transmission probability has a positive effect; (iv) The benefit of improving service capacity and/or testing more frequently is limited given the safety requirement. When the demand rises beyond the range of the capacity needed to maintain sufficient social distancing, the operator has no choice but to increase the service frequency; and (v) In the multi-line case, the lines that have a larger pre-pandemic demand, a higher penalty for each unserved passenger, or a greater exposure risk should be prioritized.",0965-8564,Not found

Why has public transit ridership declined in the United States?,10.1016/j.tra.2022.04.006,161,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Between 2012 and 2018, bus ridership in the United States declined 15% and rail ridership declined 3%.

We show that expanded transit service and land-use changes increased ridership 4.7% on bus and 10.7% on rail. However, losses due to other factors exceed these gains. Ride-hailing is the biggest contributor to transit ridership decline over this period, reducing bus ridership by 10%. Ride-hailing’s effect on rail varies by metropolitan area size: it has little effect on rail ridership in the largest metropolitan areas but decreases rail ridership 10% in mid-sized metropolitan areas. Lower gas prices and higher fares contribute to lower transit ridership, as do higher incomes, more teleworking and higher car ownership.

This study uses a dynamic traffic network simulator that models choices of mode, departure time, and route to investigate the effectiveness of tolls to target emissions and congestion externalities on a stylized urban road network during a morning commuting period. The spatial distribution of four pollutants is calculated using a Gaussian dispersion model that accounts for wind speed and direction. Single and double cordon tolls are evaluated, as well as flat tolls that do not change during the simulation period and step tolls that change at half-hourly intervals. The presence of emissions externalities raises optimal toll levels, and substantially increases the welfare gains from tolling, although the proportional advantage of step tolls over flat tolls is lower than if congestion is the only externality.

Current outcomes should be implemented in creating bicycle infrastructure that appropriately meets the demand for attractive cycling experience that is safe and enjoyable for all.",0965-8564,Not found
Inferring modality styles by revealing mode choice heterogeneity in response to weather conditions,10.1016/j.tra.2022.06.003,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"To inform policies aimed at more sustainable travel behaviour, previous research has investigated the concept of multimodality. The notion underlying this line of research is that increasing the degree of multimodality will lead to less car dependence and therefore more sustainable travel behaviour. This paper investigates multimodality by inferring modality styles and revealing their response to exogenous variation in the form of the weather. The main idea of this paper is that travellers with a more multimodal modality style are more sensitive to exogenous variation, and that they are therefore more likely to resort to the use of the car when ‘car-favouring’ conditions present themselves. The results show that the effects of weather conditions on mode choices do indeed differ between three modality styles. The identified modality styles can be summarised as (1) bike + car; (2) car mostly and (3) multimodal. For the third class, which has the highest degree of multimodality, the use of the sustainable modes is more strongly affected by weather conditions when compared to the first, less multimodal, class. The least multimodal second class meanwhile is least affected by a change in weather conditions. More multimodal travellers thus seem to be more susceptible to exogenous variation, which might prevent the formation of sustainable travel habits or patterns. Based on these results, the claim that a higher degree of multimodality will lead to more sustainable behaviour and that policy makers should aim to realise a shift towards more multimodal modality styles needs to be nuanced. Policy makers should instead focus directly on increasing the attractiveness of sustainable travel modes, which will inadvertently lead to more multimodal modality styles.",0965-8564,Not found
Assessing the impacts of COVID-19 on activity-travel scheduling: A survey in the greater Toronto area,10.1016/j.tra.2022.06.008,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The COVID-19 lockdown provided many individuals an opportunity to explore changes in their daily routines, particularly when considered in combination with an ever-changing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) landscape. These new routines and alternative activities have the potential to be continued in the post-COVID era. Transportation planners must understand how routines vary to effectively estimate activity-travel scheduling. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on activity-travel behavior and the adoption of ICT-based alternative options. A special emphasis is placed on predicting the long-term effects of this disturbance on activity-travel scheduling. This study examines the changes in the frequency and mode of completing five of the most repetitious tasks in the daily schedule (working, grocery and non-grocery shopping, preparing/eating meals, and visiting family/friends) during the lockdown and immediately after reopening. We find an increased preference for home meal preparation over online ordering and a reluctance to engage in in-person shopping until a substantial proportion of the population has acquired a vaccination against the virus. Respondents prefer to work from home if they have adequate access to home office materials (e.g., desk, chair, computer monitor).

Exploring economic feasibility for airport shuttle service of urban air mobility (UAM),10.1016/j.tra.2022.06.004,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"UAM is a new concept of mobility that expands the two-dimensional transportation system to three dimensions using a personal air vehicle (PAV). This study explores the economic feasibility of the UAM airport shuttle service from two perspectives. First, this study estimates the fare of UAM services to attract customers. The UAM service should maintain a competitive price to convert existing transportation users into UAM users. This study used Incheon Airport (ICN) ground transportation data to estimate a competitive fare based on the multinomial logit model. The pricing range at which UAM services can obtain users from Seoul Station to ICN is estimated to be 96 to 108 USD, assuming the new service reduces traveling time by 30–40 min compared to taxi service. The comparison with professional institutions indicates that the 96–108 USD price range is feasible. However, according to a simulation based on the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, other approaches to increase economic feasibility are required. Second, this study reviewed operational policies to improve the economic feasibility of UAM shuttle services from two perspectives. The first is a service perspective that introduces new services or enhances the current service level. The internalization of CNS (communications, navigation, and surveillance) and UTM (unmanned traffic management) services can be a new business area, including premium routing. The second is introducing a dynamic pricing policy. Segmented pricing, time-based pricing, and changing market conditions strategies can practically strengthen the economic feasibility. Operating an airport Vertiport providing a dedicated path for UAM passengers can allow UAM operators to charge more on a premium passenger segment by shortening airport procedure time. Because it can avoid the uncertainty of road congestion, there is plenty of incentive to set higher fares during peak times with severe congestion. In addition, by creating a market environment in which multiple operators participate, the operators can share the burden of infrastructure construction and operation, which account for more than 80% of the total operating costs, increasing the economic feasibility of services.",0965-8564,Not found
Synthetic control methods for policy analysis: Evaluating the effect of the European Emission Trading System on aviation supply,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.015,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"In this paper, we provide a novel application of synthetic control methods by offering two major modifications to the existing methodological framework. We provide the first complete ex-post evaluation of the causal impact of carbon pricing on aviation supply, expressed in terms of airline output (i.e., number of seats supplied at the airline-route level). We investigated the policy change in the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS), the first large greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world. We distinguish between low-cost, regional and full service airlines, short and medium/long-haul routes, routes towards (or from) hub airports versus non-hub airports, monopolistic versus non-monopolistic routes. The analysis shows that the EU ETS does not have a substantial impact on the average aircraft size, while it has caused a reduction of total airline seat capacity and flight frequency, with the percentage of airline seat capacity reduction reaching above 20% at its peak. The overall effect of the policy has a remarkable impact on low-cost and regional airlines, short-haul routes, spoke–spoke markets and monopolistic routes. Our results are the first empirical confirmation to the theoretical prediction in the aviation literature that emission charges will reduce flight frequency and increase load factors while having no effect on aircraft size.",0965-8564,Not found

Although the travel satisfaction of ordinary travelers has received extensive attention in previous studies, few have focused on the important bearer groups of the last mile urban logistics, especially with the current influx of delivery electric two-wheeler (DETW) riders on the road. This study aims to quantitatively explore the impact of riding perception, delivery attributes, built environment, and demographic variables on delivery travel satisfaction of DETW riders. Data were collected in Nanjing, China, through a questionnaire survey. The results show that the inclusion of built environment variables has provided additional variance explanation and proved their direct or indirect effect on delivery travel satisfaction. Besides, safety and accessibility, environmental comfort, delivery convenience, policy acceptance, and perceived stress positively affect delivery travel satisfaction, while delivery punishment has a negative effect. Delivery convenience is the most important variable explaining delivery travel satisfaction. Finally, policies at all levels, including individual riders, platforms, consumers, and public administration, are proposed to enhance the DETW riders’ well-being and make the food delivery industry more sustainable and appealing.",0965-8564,Not found
Accelerating electric vehicle uptake: Modelling public policy options on prices and infrastructure,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.012,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Transitioning to passenger battery electric vehicles (BEV) can mitigate climate change impacts of road transportation. We develop a novel BEV policy model, nesting it within a national-scale macroeconomic system dynamics model (iSDG-Australia) to simulate a suite of policy pathways. We model combinations of infrastructure support and subsidies, which bring forward the price-parity tipping point, thus rapidly accelerating BEVs’ share of new car sales. However, ongoing complementary charging infrastructure investment is critical to reach 100% new BEV car sales by 2050 in Australia. Even with a rapid transition, the modelled fleet would not achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 due to vehicle longevity; and suddenly ceasing financial incentives could retard BEV sales by a decade. Based on our assumptions, results suggest emissions reductions are maximised by the fastest transition of the passenger vehicle fleet to BEVs, entailing government policy support from 2020 to 2050, for both adequate infrastructure deployment (AUD17.9b) and vehicle rebates (AUD19.5b), which achieves earlier BEV price-parity with fossil-fuelled vehicles.",0965-8564,Not found
Estimating wider economic impacts of transport infrastructure Investment: Evidence from accessibility disparity in Hong Kong,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.014,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Much recent work on transport and the economy has focused on ‘Wider Economic Impacts’ (WEIs) of infrastructure investment, the impacts other than time savings benefiting those actually using the transport network. Differential effects of transportation infrastructure by mode such as urban rail and road are relatively well known. However, impacts of other mode such as walking are scarce. This paper estimates wider economic impacts related to productivity from full rail, road and walking transport networks in Hong Kong in 2016. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that makes use of complex network science indicators with spatial cognition-weighted accessibility combining full urban rail network, road network, and pedestrian network in capturing wider economic impacts. We use an instrumental variable approach to identify the causal effect of transport network centralities on productivity measured by gross value added. Our identification strategy largely relies on the exogenous variations from historical planned and existing transport networks. A first specification confirms the significance of urban rail and road. Specification with pedestrian network shows that pedestrian and rail networks can statistically significantly increase productivity in Hong Kong while roads play a less significant but still meaningful role. Our findings are robust to a variety of sensitivity tests such as using night-time light intensity and residential wage as alternative measures for productivity. The research suggests a key planning policy implication: place-based policies in a dense city require improvement in pedestrian and rail network structure that impacts local and global transport accessibility.",0965-8564,Not found
An investigation of contributing factors for warehouse location and the relationship between local attributes and explanatory variables of Warehouse Freight Trip Generation Model,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.025,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The location of warehouses is strategic for urban goods distribution, and the decision factors are subjective. This paper aims to analyse the contributing factors to warehouse location and describe the association between local attributes and the explanatory variables of a Warehouse Freight Trip Generation Model (WFTGM). We developed this study using data from 42 warehouses located in Belo Horizonte (Brazil). The results indicated that the accessibility to/from warehouses and the land cost are the most critical factors contributing to warehouse location decision. Additionally, the accessibility of trucks for delivery has a strong positive correlation with the accessibility of freight vehicles for loading. The land cost negatively correlates with all factors except the employee's accessibility, indicating an antagonistic relationship with other variables. Considering the Warehouse Freight Trip Generation Model, the warehouse-size related variables provided the best-fit models. Additionally, the warehouse size is not independent of the neighbourhoods' population and distance to the main ring roads traversing this city.

Investigating attitudes towards fleet electrification – An exploratory analysis approach,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.009,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper examines the attitudes and perceptions of fleets operating entities (FOEs) towards electric vehicles (EVs) using revealed preference data from a random sample of over 1000 Canadian entities. The data records were obtained through an online survey. The results from the conducted Exploratory Factor Analysis suggest that latent constructs involving technology and cost might deter adoption of EVs among the sampled FOEs. On the other hand, monetary and non-monetary considerations with the former informed by lower maintenance and fuel cost, and the latter by access to high occupancy vehicle lanes and availability of free parking, might support the adoption. In terms of attitudes and perceptions, the two leading constructs that emerged from the analysis could be described as early adopter and cost conscience attitudes. The dominant loadings giving rise to the first construct are attributed to the two variables: adopting emerging technologies is not a risky decision and a fleet of EVs can meet operational needs of the businesses. On the other hand, the loadings associated with the second construct collectively represent a mindset in which FOEs seek cost saving benefits of adopting EVs in their fleets. Overall, the results indicate similar attitudinal profiles for corporate and government sector fleets with slight variation in their responses to some of the deterring factors that included higher electricity and insurance rates, operational reliability concerns due to range limitation and longer charging times. Finally, the risk of implementing new technology compared to total cost of ownership and environmental benefits is evaluated with relatively higher importance by the sampled FOEs.",0965-8564,Not found
Exploring non-linear built environment effects on the integration of free-floating bike-share and urban rail transport: A quantile regression approach,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.022,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Bike-sharing offers a convenient feeder mode for connecting to public transport, which helps to address the last-mile problem. However, few studies have examined the nuanced relationship between the built environment and the integration of free-floating bike-sharing (FFBS) with urban rail transport (URT). Drawing on weekly records of 3.12 million trips of the FFBS system in Nanjing, China, we examined the nonlinear effects of the built environment on FFBS-URT integrated use. A quantile regression method is utilised to estimate the relationships for morning and evening peaks, respectively. The results demonstrate the existence of the nonlinearity of the relationships. The effects of the built environment show variations in the significance levels and magnitudes of coefficients, depending on the quantiles. For example, the length of minor roads in station areas is strongly related to the integrated use at low quantile stations, whereas this effect is not statistically significant at medium and high quantiles. We also find that bicycle infrastructure displays more salient nonlinear effects than land-use variables and external transport facilities. In addition, temporal differences in the relationships between the built environment and the integrated use are also unveiled. Our findings help to inform dedicated and effective built environment interventions which support the planning of seamless connections between bike-sharing and urban rail transport.",0965-8564,Not found
An optimization model to assign seats in long distance trains to minimize SARS-CoV-2 diffusion,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.005,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The unprecedented spread of SARS-CoV-2 has pushed governmental bodies to undertake stringent actions like travel regulations, localized curfews, curb activity participation, etc. These restrictions assisted in controlling the proliferation of the virus; however, they severely affected major economies. This compels policymakers and planners to devise strategies that restrain virus spread as well as operationalize economic activities. In this context, we discuss some of the potential implications of seat inventory management in long-distance passenger trains and create a balance between operators’ operational efficiency and passengers’ safety. The paper introduces a novel seat assignment policy that aims to mitigate virus diffusion risk among passengers by reducing interaction among them. A mixed-integer linear programming problem has been formulated that concomitantly maximizes the operator’s revenue and minimizes virus diffusion. The validity of the model has been tested using real-life data obtained from Indian Railways. The computational results show that a mere 50% capacity utilization may distress operators’ economics and prove ineffectual in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The proposed model produces encouraging results in restricting virus diffusion and improving revenue even under 100% capacity utilization.",0965-8564,Not found
A new curb lane monitoring and illegal parking impact estimation approach based on queueing theory and computer vision for cameras with low resolution and low frame rate,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.024,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The rapid development of the internet of things (IoT), sensing technologies, and machine learning and deep learning techniques, along with the growing variety and volume of data, have yielded new perspectives on how novel technologies can be applied to obtain new sources of curb data to achieve cost-effective curb management. This study presents a new computer vision–based data acquisition and analytics approach for curb lane monitoring and illegal parking impact assessment. The proposed “rank, detect, and quantify impacts” system consists of three main modules: 1) hotspot identification based on rankings generated by local spatial autocorrelation analysis, 2) curb lane occupancy estimation leveraging traffic cameras and computer vision techniques, and 3) illegal parking traffic impact quantification using an M/M/∞ queueing model. To demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach, it was tested and empirically validated using field data collected from three case study sites in Midtown Manhattan, New York City (NYC)—one of the most complex urban transportation networks in the world. Different types of curb lane occupancy, including parking and bus lanes, and different frequencies of illegal parking (high, moderate, low) were investigated. The proposed method was proven to be effective even for low resolution and discontinuous video feeds obtained from publicly available traffic cameras. All three case study sites achieved good detection accuracy (86% to 96%) for parking and bus lane occupancy, and acceptable precision and recall in detecting illegal parking events. The queueing model was also proven to effectively quantify link travel time with the appearance of illegal parking events of different frequencies. The proposed “rank, detect, and quantify impacts” system is friendly for large-scale real-time implementation and is highly scalable to help evaluate the impact of other modes such as bike or mobility-on-demand (MOD) services. It can also be easily adopted by other cities to provide transportation agencies with effective data collection and innovative curb space management strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
An empirical assessment of the impact of subsidies on EV adoption in China: A difference-in-differences approach,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.020,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"It is widely recognized that electric vehicles (EVs) will play a crucial role in the electrification of transport, which is necessary for reaching a net-zero emissions economy. This recognition is reflected in the number of initiatives introduced worldwide to promote the EV industry, ranging from purchase subsidies to the provision of charging infrastructure and direct industry assistance. In this context, the Chinese government introduced a comprehensive program of government subsidies to support the sale of EVs. This paper estimates the impacts of these subsidies on EV sales in China using the difference-in-differences (DID) and propensity score matching (PSM) approach. Based on the panel data at city level from 2009 to 2018, we show that subsidies were the major contributor to the increase in EV sales. Our results suggest that the provision of infrastructure such as charging piles is also an important contributing factor. These findings are robust across model specifications and regression approaches. The heterogeneity analysis indicates that the treatment effect is heterogeneous across EV types, city sizes and regions.

The operational continuity of ports is critical because of the growing reliance of domestic and international businesses on ports and their significance in the growth of national and regional economies. While direct physical damages to ports are not rare, a shutdown of port operations is more likely declared by authorities as a precautionary and preparatory measure during hurricanes. Considering the enormous economic importance of ports and their vulnerability to hurricanes, the current study proposes a framework and methodology to analyze the economic risks of such hurricane-related shutdowns using hurricane- and port-related determinants. The risks of shutdowns are modeled using regression analysis based on historical port shutdown data and are combined with extensions of the well-known input–output model to predict the operational and economic risks of ports to hurricanes.

However, the impact of the pandemic on passenger perceptions of public transport, particularly loyalty, has remained largely unexplored. Using a case study of Tehran’s bus system, this paper aims to assess the moderating effect of COVID-19 on passenger loyalty. A cross-sectional survey of bus users was conducted in two similar periods, before and during COVID-19. The data was analysed using structural equation modelling, with the effect of observed heterogeneity evaluated using multiple indicators multiple causes models and multi-group analysis. The results indicate that during COVID-19, perceptions of service quality have improved, particularly in relation to comfort (including crowding), safety, reliability and information. While this has led to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty to the system has decreased. An increase in the perceived attractiveness of using private cars was found to be the primary factor for reducing passenger loyalty with the perceived monetary and psychological costs of using cars being less effective in encouraging people to use the bus.

Perceived barriers to the movement of goods in Canada: A grounded theory investigation,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.011,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper investigates stakeholder’s perspectives about freight congestion in Canada’s major metropolitan regions. Interviews with 28 Canadian stakeholders from different sectors are analyzed using Strauss/Corbin extended approach of symbolic interactionism with the objective of producing an explanatory theory to identify barriers to freight in Canada. By integrating emergent categories with a structured framework of theoretical propositions, we are able to offer insights to understand the perceived barriers to goods movement in the Canadian landscape, as well as to detail a framework of interventions to improve freight mobility. In total, 50 themes emerged as barriers to the movement of goods, which were grouped into nine subcategories, and four overarching categories which broadly frame the issues of goods movements as relating to high infrastructure utilization (Infrastructure Demand Outstripping Supply), the cost impacts of diminishing reliability of distribution (Physical Distribution Headwinds Impeding Commerce), rapidly growing regions and ineffective or absent policy support (Urgent Regulatory Encumbrances), and a lack of a robust data collection, analysis, and information sharing framework (Information and Data Management Complexities). These categories were considered in the frame of addressing goods movement barriers and were argued to be influenced by factors of cost, political risk, implement-ability, and maintainability. A framework was developed identifying four high-level interventions: data and knowledge mobilization; public-private collaborative freight evaluations; government funding and political support; and, capacity alterations: improvements and expansions. The key concepts of the framework are to collect and analyze data to inform public-private stakeholder evaluations of policy interventions, with government funding to support both knowledge generation efforts, policy actions and capacity investments. There is a significant need to expand data collection and information sharing, focus infrastructure investments on public transit and intermodal accessibility, and integrated policy development towards transportation and land use planning to address the physical and policy barriers affecting freight mobility and congestion.

Expected service dimensions and service levels for paratransit considering future mobility needs in emerging countries,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.021,162,2022-08-01,2022,8,"In emerging countries, flexible transport systems (FTS) are mostly informal and are provided by individual paratransit operators/drivers. These services are largely unregulated thus resulting in uncoordinated operations with poor service quality. Earnings and working conditions of paratransit drivers/operators are also poor due to loosely regulated fleet size and other operational and regulatory issues which results in further deterioration of service quality. This research identifies key service dimensions and issues of paratransit services and also determines the expected service level for these service dimensions using the level of service approach based on user perception. LOS scales are designed for different service attributes using a five-point satisfaction and importance rating system. For quantitative attributes, five-level LOS scales are determined by applying the Law of Successive Interval Scaling, whereas for qualitative attributes, the same has been developed using the frequency of response for each level of importance for each sub-attribute. Subsequently, we explore various policies and regulatory measures towards reform and redesign of paratransit services and other mobility needs. Operator profitability can be achieved both through the controlled entry of operators through the issue of permits and/or by relaxing the current service level of some service aspects which are at LOS B level of service. The LOS scales can help in future service design of paratransit services in emerging countries which can offer an affordable alternative to ridesourcing and ride-sharing using cars.

Drawing on data from the 2012 California Household Travel Survey, we isolate the determinants of vehicle use within dual-earner, dual-driver, heterosexual households in which drivers share a single vehicle. We test four gender-related hypotheses: the role of disparities in economic power, practical necessity related to the household division of labor, gender norms, and gender preferences. We find that practical necessity—the amount of time that spouses spend on household-serving or work-related activities—is the primary determinant of automobile use for both men and women. In contrast to previous research, we find that women have substantially more exclusive access to the household vehicle than their male partners. Rather than a measure of equality, this finding reflects the persistence of the gender division of household labor and the role of the car in its maintenance. The study underscores the broader need for policies to equalize gender roles both within and between the home and the workplace, as well as a role for transportation policies that serve the needs of household members who do not have primary use of the household car.",0965-8564,Not found

In addition to car sharing membership and related patterns of use, sociodemographic characteristics of respondents, opinions about other transport means, attitudes towards private car, and environmental concerns were considered in the models’ specification. Both regression models showed that car sharing membership is one of the strongest predictors of car shedding.

On the potential of carsharing to attract regular trips of private car and public transport users in metropolitan areas,10.1016/j.tra.2022.07.003,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"To discourage private car ownership and to solve the first/last mile problems when using public transport (PT), carsharing has been introduced in many cities across the world in recent years. One-way carsharing schemes are expected to improve convenience for users and promote the usage of PT by supplementing it. Previous literature has indicated that carsharing has the effect of reducing vehicle distances throughout the area and of converting some traffic to other modes. The effects have been, however, in many cases smaller than expected or at least hoped for. Carsharing is mostly used only for the occasional, irregular trip. This study contributes to the literature by developing a combined RP and SP survey in which our focus is on whether carsharing might be chosen on a regular basis. The survey is conducted among 852 respondents from Aichi prefecture, Japan, where a carsharing scheme is existing. We control for previous carsharing experience and model explicitly the scenario that carsharing is used in combination with PT. We quantify with integrated choice and latent variable models (ICLV) the importance of the perceived inconvenience of the transport situation, the time and cost of taking PT and costs associated with driving one’s private cars and the importance of having a carsharing experience. We also show that car drivers willing to give up their own car might be inclined to use carsharing as access to or egress from PT. Sensitivity analyses with respect to carsharing prices and vehicle availability indicate the overall limited market potential of carsharing in Japanese metropolitan areas unless drastic changes to the current transport systems occur.",0965-8564,Not found
Measuring the vulnerability of bike-sharing system,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.019,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"As a complex system, the bike-sharing system suffers from system failures, which can increase travel costs and impair user satisfaction. We proposed a concept of the vulnerability of bike-sharing system and a method to measure it. The method depends on the cost changes due to additional travel time induced by the failure of bike docking stations. It can capture the traffic mode transfer in the context of multi-modal traffic system, such as walking, bus, and subway. Moreover, to investigate the impact of network structure on the vulnerability, we developed the centrality measuring methods, and a community detection model for the bike-sharing system. Subsequently, the proposed methods are applied to Citi Bike in New York City, the largest bike-sharing system in the USA. The results show that the most vulnerable bike docking stations are located far from bus and railway stations, with low docking station density in their surrounding areas. We also found that the number of nearby bicycle stations, bus stops, and subway stations have a negative correlation with the vulnerability index.

Effects of the Federal Aviation Administration's Compliance Program on aircraft incidents and accidents,10.1016/j.tra.2022.07.016,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"A novel enforcement policy based on restorative justice principles was implemented by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2015. In this study, interrupted time series regression analyses using generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GLARMA) models were used to analyze FAA investigated incident and accident counts, runway incursion caused by pilot deviation, and National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) accident count data from June 2010 to September 2020. An association was observed between the change in FAA’s enforcement policy and the increase in aircraft incidents, accidents, and runway incursions post-intervention (2015–2020). These adverse safety outcomes appear to be directly related to this policy change. Results highlight the risk of moving away from punishment as a means of reinforcing safe behavior and the need for careful theory-based implementation of alternative approaches.",0965-8564,Not found
A game theoretic approach to study the impact of transportation policies on the competition between transit and private car in the urban context,10.1016/j.tra.2022.07.005,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This paper proposes a spatial gaming model to characterize the mode choice behavior of travelers on a corridor connecting a suburban neighborhood to the central business district. Previous game theoretic studies typically incorporate a discrete choice model into the gaming structure to observe travelers’ mode choice behavior. The novelty of the proposed model revolves around incorporating parking operator into the gaming structure. We also present a model extension accounting for the heterogeneity in travelers’ income. The parking operator and transit agency, as the two players of the game, seek to obtain a greater market share by controlling their prices. The nature of the transit agency as a (pseudo) public authority is modeled by letting the player maximize a weighted sum of profit and consumer surplus. The private parking operator, on the other hand, is a profit maximizer. With the out-of-pocket cost, generalized travel time, and disutilities other than time in the utility function of travelers, this gaming model enable us to evaluate the impact on auto-transit competition of a wide range of urban policies. A corridor in Isfahan, Iran is considered to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. Eight travel demand management policies are examined. We see that restrictive policies (e.g., cordon pricing) typically reduce the total demand while encouraging policies (e.g., improving transit access time by integrating transit with a bike-sharing system) increase it. The most effective policies are found to be hybrid policies such as increasing auto travel time coupled with lowering transit in-vehicle travel time.",0965-8564,Not found
The cost of the wider impacts of road traffic on local communities: 1.6% of Great Britain's GDP,10.1016/j.tra.2022.05.016,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This paper estimates the negative effects of motorised road traffic on the travel and walking behaviour of local residents in Great Britain and the cost of the wider negative impacts on local economic activity, external effects of motorised transport, social exclusion, neighbourhood social capital, self-rated health, and subjective wellbeing. We use the results of a survey (n = 3038) and models linking the characteristics of roads and pedestrian crossing facilities in each participant’s local area, travel and walking behaviour, and the level and monetary value of the wider impacts of travel behaviour. The costs of road traffic borne by local communities were estimated as £31.9 billion per year, i.e. 1.6% of the Gross Domestic Product, or £631 per person. This value varies within the interval £569-£698/person/year, depending on the assumptions made. The highest estimated costs of motorised road traffic are reduced neighbourhood social capital (£236) and reduced subjective wellbeing (£196/person/year). The costs for some population segments, such as London residents, city residents, and people aged 25–34 are higher than the average. The characteristic of roads causing the highest costs is volume of motorised traffic above low (£264/person/year), followed by multiple lanes (£148), traffic speeds above low (£119), and absence of a median strip (£60). By quantifying for the first time, at the national level, the costs of the negative community effects of motor vehicles, this study provides evidence supporting policies to reduce traffic volumes and speeds and reallocate roadspace to pedestrians.",0965-8564,Not found
Quantifying the social impacts of the London Night Tube with a double/debiased machine learning based difference-in-differences approach,10.1016/j.tra.2022.07.015,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"There is a worldwide trend toward a growing number of people involved in various night-time activities. The night-time public transport service is of central importance for the urban night-time mobility. In London, the Night Tube service was launched in 2016 to meet the constantly growing night-time travel demand and support London’s night-time economy. Yet limited empirical evidence on the ex-post impacts of the London Night Tube has been provided. In this study, we conduct a causal analysis on such impacts using a double/debiased machine learning based difference-in-differences approach. Specifically, we quantify the impacts of the Night Tube on London’s night-time economy, house prices, road crashes and related casualties, and crimes. We further investigate the spatial variations in such impacts. Our results indicate a rise in house prices associated with the announcement and the implementation of the service. The number of night-time workplaces showed a limited response. Regarding the safety dimension, we find that the Night Tube service led to a small reduction in the frequency of road crashes but a substantial reduction in crash-related casualties. However, the crime rate in areas served by the Night Tube was increased, especially for the following two categories, robbery of personal property and violence against the person. Moreover, the impact on the crime rate is found to be larger in the inner London area. These findings provide practical implications for urban planners and policy makers, and reveal the need for monitoring the social impacts of the Night Tube service from a long-term perspective.",0965-8564,Not found
Who uses green mobility?

The sustainable growth of society is linked to green mobility (e.g., public transport, walking, cycling) as a way to alleviate individual carbon footprints. This study explores the socio-demographic profile of individuals performing green travel (public and active modes of transport) and identifies cross-country differences in green travel behavior. We rely on information from the Multinational Time Use Study, MTUS, for Bulgaria, Canada, Spain, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, from 2000 to 2019. We estimate Ordinary Least Squares regressions modelling individual decisions regarding green mobility. Our results indicate that the socio-demographic and family profile of travelers is not homogenous across green modes of transport, with walking as a mode of travel exhibiting a much more consistent profile, across countries, in comparison to the use of public transport and cycling. Results indicate that some countries are more prone to green travel, and that transport infrastructure is a factor in the proportion of time spent on both public and active transport. Our findings help in understanding who is committed to green mobility, while revealing interesting systematic differences across countries.",0965-8564,Not found
"Can an Incentive-Based approach to rebalancing a Dock-less Bike-share system Work? Evidence from Sacramento, California",10.1016/j.tra.2022.07.011,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Bike-share services will produce more limited benefits if users cannot find bikes when and where they need them. Bike-share operators must thus have process for “rebalancing” the bikes within the system to ensure that they are available where demanded. A potentially cost-effective strategy for rebalancing bikes is to offer incentives of some sort to users to walk farther to get a bike (origin-based incentive) or bring a bike to the undersupplied area (destination-based incentive). This paper aims to examine bike-share users’ willingness-to-walk to pick up a bike or drop off a bike at some distance from their origins or destinations if rewarded and to identify characteristics influencing willingness-to-walk. We use data from a survey of dock-less e-bike-share users conducted in the Sacramento region. The analysis shows that half of the respondents use bike-share if the available bike is located 8.9 min away. Our estimates of willingness-to-walk farther than the mean distance for incentives at origins and destinations were 3.8 min and 4.2 min per dollar, respectively. Our results give operators and policy makers insights into the potential effectiveness of incentives as a strategy for spatially rebalancing bike-share fleets.",0965-8564,Not found
A meta-analysis of the impact of rail stations on property values: Applying a transit planning lens,10.1016/j.tra.2022.06.013,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Access to transit infrastructure is valuable. In areas surrounding rail stations, some of that value gets absorbed by property markets. Since 1970, over 200 case studies worldwide have explored the extent to which transit access impacts property value uplift. However, findings from this body of research vary widely. In an attempt to explain this variation, previous meta-analytic studies have focused on testing the roles that built environment elements, temporal factors, and modelling techniques play in shaping the observed relationship between proximate positioning from rail stations and property pricing. This study expands on these meta-analyses by introducing the first examination of how transit service elements – e.g. frequency, fare, reliability – impact rail-induced residential property value uplift. It further contributes to the literature by expanding the range of geo-comparability of uplift findings across four continents, examining the potential effects of the Global Financial Crisis of the late 2000s, and adding 10 new variables of potential influence not only under the banner of ‘transit service’, but pertaining to neighborhood socio-demographics and housing policy as well. Findings reveal that factors of geography, housing data type, race and ethnicity, rent control policies, rail type, transit cost, and transit network expanse all significantly affect rail access uplift magnitude ranging from depreciating effects of 7.4 percentage points to appreciating effects of 9.6 percentage points. Beyond helping to explain variation across the literature, these findings can be a useful tool for policymakers combatting trends of increasing market-driven displacement from transit-rich areas, those pursuing financing mechanisms for transit infrastructure, and to transit planners concerned with how their decisions may affect matters of housing equity for the communities they serve.",0965-8564,Not found
Tradeoffs between optimality and equity in transportation network protection against sea level rise,10.1016/j.tra.2022.07.006,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Transportation equity is an essential aspect of urban transportation planning. With climate change becoming inevitable, coastal cities are considering the mitigation of the impact of sea level rise on infrastructure. Transportation equity and sea level rise adaptation are usually considered separately. However, research pointed out that these two challenges could have considerable overlap and interaction. The present paper discusses transportation equity issues resulting from the impact of sea level rise and associated protection strategies. A case study of the San Francisco Bay Area points out cases where transportation equity can be negatively impacted when the optimal protection strategy against sea level rise is implemented. An integrated hydrodynamic and transportation model system is used in the present paper to demonstrate several scenarios where the most efficient protection strategies for the whole region increase the inequity that exists between the disadvantaged communities and other communities. Nevertheless, this impact can be mitigated with a relatively small addition to the protection strategy. The paper suggests that transportation equity cannot be overlooked in planning climate adaptation, as even the protection plan that maximizes benefits for the region may negatively impact the most vulnerable communities.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper investigates travel and activity barriers faced by people with disabilities using data from the American Time Use Survey from 2008 to 2019. Our dependent variable of interest is a measure of realized accessibility known as a travel time price: that is, the number of travel minutes associated with each minute of out-of-home activity time. In using this measure, we first confirm that out-of-home activities are associated with greater subjective well-being, that travel is associated with relatively low well-being, and that travel time prices are negatively associated with life satisfaction. We next find that people with disabilities typically pay a travel time price premium 50 percent higher than those without disabilities for all out-of-home activities, and 11 percent higher for work trips. These premiums narrow but persist when accounting for personal characteristics and travel mode. We discuss the unique contributions of simple linear and multiple regression results, given that disability is so closely linked to personal characteristics like employment, income, and marital status. We then disaggregate the results by type of disability and close by presenting ideas for removing transportation and activity barriers for the heterogenous population of people with disabilities.",0965-8564,Not found
Cross-analysis of the variability of travel behaviors using one-day trip diaries and longitudinal data,10.1016/j.tra.2022.07.013,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Many travel surveys used in transportation planning still collect information over a single weekday while mobility and activity patterns fluctuate from day to day. However, the emergence of new continuous data sources has led to the generation of large amounts of longitudinal data. Therefore, this paper aims to value these two data types to cross-analyze the temporal variability of aggregated travel behaviors. A weighting method based on large-scale single-day survey samples was first developed to extend the representativeness of the daily trip diaries available in the three most recent Origin-Destination household travel surveys of Montreal, Canada, to the entire data collection period (four months in the fall). This method was then validated using passive data streams (smart card and count data) for three modes: car, subway, and bicycle. The variations in the daily use of these modes measured independently by the surveys and passive data were compared over several months of the fall period and throughout an average week. Indicators were also proposed to evaluate whether the two data sources capture the same trend and seasonality, especially the weekly rhythms. The results show that it is possible to accurately infer day-to-day variability in travel behavior from a large-scale cross-sectional single-day survey. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the potential for complementarity between traditional surveys and emerging data (at least over the survey period), as well as the possibility to combine them since there are large similarities in the aggregated travel patterns they allow monitoring.",0965-8564,Not found
"A direct demand model for bus transit ridership in Bengaluru, India",10.1016/j.tra.2022.07.004,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"This study formulates a disaggregate direct demand model of bus transit ridership while addressing the following substantive and methodological issues: (a) endogeneity and non-linearity of the influence of service frequency on ridership, (b) inter-route relationships such as competition and complementarity among routes within the bus transit network and with other transit networks (such as the metro/rail network), (c) relating spatially aggregated demand to disaggregate, stop-level catchment characteristics – although demand data are available only at an aggregation of stop-clusters, and (d) overlapping of catchment areas among closely spaced stops. The proposed model is applied to analyze bus transit ridership (boardings) during weekdays for morning peak period in Bengaluru, India. This study is among the first to develop a comprehensive direct demand model for forecasting bus transit ridership in an Indian city. Yet, the proposed conceptual and methodological framework and the findings from the study are general enough to be of use for transit planning in other cities of India and other countries. Transit agencies with spatially aggregate, fare-stage cluster-level ridership data can employ the proposed approach to examine the influence of disaggregate stop-level catchment characteristics on ridership. Additionally, transit agencies may utilise the proposed model to quantify bus ridership impacts of service network modifications, route alignments, and network connectivity/accessibility, while considering interactions with other transit networks. The empirical results suggest that while increasing service frequency increases ridership along low-frequency routes, the returns from increasing service frequency diminish as current frequency levels increase. Further, it is shown that route-level passenger kilometres, a variable commonly available with transit agencies, serves effectively as an instrument for addressing endogeneity between route-level service frequency and stop-route-level ridership.",0965-8564,Not found

The overall research objective is to explore UT motivations in terms of demographics and trip characteristics, such as mode, frequency, distance, and duration, using survey data from Flanders, Belgium during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (18 March – 4 May 2020). First, a factor analysis identifies four main motivations for UT: 1. Improving Health and Well-Being, 2. Removing Negative Feelings, 3. Enjoying Scenery, and 4. Out-of-Home Socializing. Following, differences in UT motivations across groups are analyzed with mean-comparisons of demographic characteristics, trip characteristics, and attitude and well-being measurements. Findings suggest a clear relationship between UT and physical/mental health. There are stronger motivations for active than motorized UT trips, and stronger motivations associated with use of multiple modes. Longer (distance and duration) and more frequent UT trips increasingly fulfill all motivations. This research provides more evidence for the idea that travel is not always a derived demand for which less is always better, or an ancillary event to other activities, and can offer baseline empirical information on UT from which future studies can grow as well as contribute information about the value of travel.",0965-8564,Not found
Modeling individuals’ preferences towards different levels of vehicle autonomy: A random parameter rank-ordered logit model,10.1016/j.tra.2022.06.010,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Vehicular automation is changing the conventional way of driving – e.g., the role of a driver is changing into an observer or a passenger due to the higher levels of automation. However, the success of this vehicle automation potentially leading to fully autonomous vehicles largely depends on the interest and comfort of consumers. Adoption of such disruptive technologies might have a retrospective aspect related to individuals’ experiences, such as exposure to technologies over their life course. This study adopts a life history-oriented approach to investigate individuals' preferences towards different levels of vehicle autonomy. The effects of historical experiences in different life domains such as technology usage in daily life and availability of vehicle technology, and the evolution of demographics such as historically living in an owned dwelling are explored. Data comes from a retrospective survey conducted in the Okanagan region of Canada. A random parameter rank-ordered logit model is developed to accommodate the relative ranked preferences of the alternatives and to capture unobserved heterogeneity. The model results suggest that individuals with historical exposure to vehicle technology have a higher likelihood of adopting higher levels of vehicle automation, whereas individuals having advanced technology only in the current vehicle reveal a lower interest towards higher vehicle autonomy. Individuals without a driver’s license show a higher interest in full automation, whereas they are less interested in no automation. The model confirms the existence of heterogeneity. For instance, pro-urban individuals prefer no automation, whereas pro-suburban individuals are inclined towards full automation. Both variables show significant heterogeneity with a large standard deviation. The findings of this study demonstrate the need to accommodate the effects of historical experiences while analyzing the preferences towards different levels of automation. Such inclusion of life history-oriented attributes within the travel demand forecasting models is expected to improve the demand and usage prediction accuracy of different levels of vehicle automation.",0965-8564,Not found

Furthermore, truck platooning could be introduced with increasing levels of automation, corresponding to different technologies and operational costs. In parallel, various Countries promote freight-related infrastructural plans pursuing a modal shift from the road towards more sustainable modes (railways, sea shipping, inland waterways). The planning horizon of such infrastructures probably overlaps, at least partially, with a non-negligible market penetration of truck platooning. In this framework, the paper aims to explore the extent of a system-wide competition between existing freight modes and truck platooning, through an exploratory analysis of the potential market of truck platooning in Italy. The study is based on a comparative analysis of the cost of various freight modes, leveraging a multimodal nationwide freight supply model. Forty different scenarios have been modelled, with different assumptions on the input variables including three levels of automation. Results show that truck platooning could be highly competitive with respect to rail transport for medium to large distances. Competition with conventional road transport is significant as well, with a large contestable market share between truck platooning and traditional road freight, especially on medium to long distances, whilst maritime transport starts competing with truck platooning only in the case of (at least partially) unmanned truck platooning operations. The size of truck platoons impacts appreciably on results only with a manned leader truck and unmanned followers.

An online questionnaire was distributed to 994 Scottish residents in order to identify travel habits, attitudes and preferences during the different phases of the COVID-19 outbreak and travel intentions after the pandemic. Quota constraints were enforced for age, gender and household income to ensure the sample was representative of the Scottish population. The respondents indicated that they anticipated they would make less use of buses and trains at the end of the pandemic. Over a third expect to use buses (36%) and trains (34%) less, whilst a quarter expect to drive their cars more. As part of the analysis, a random parameter bivariate probit model with heterogeneity in the means of random parameters was estimated to provide insights into the socio-demographic, behavioural and perceptual factors which might affect future public transport usage. The inclusion of random parameters allows for the potential effects of unobserved heterogeneity within the independent variables to be captured, whilst making allowances for heterogeneity in the means of the random parameters. The model estimation showed that several factors, including pre-lockdown travel choices, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, household size and region significantly affected intended future use of public transport. In addition, several variables related to age, region, pre-lockdown travel choices and employment status resulted in random parameters. The current paper contributes to our understanding of the potential loss of demand for public transport and the consequences for future equitable and sustainable mobility.

In addition, among the items that passengers consider important, the route location was found to be positively significant in seat bidding behavior on long-distance routes. In the end, according to the WTP analysis, the price differences that passengers were willing to pay for an upgraded seat from economic class to business class were about 27.6% and 29.8% of the price difference for short-distance routes (from Taiwan to Cebu and Seoul), respectively, while the price differences for long-distance routes from Taiwan to New York and Amsterdam were 25.8% and 29.9% of the price difference.

Is it time for a new bus contract procurement model under a zero emissions bus setting?,10.1016/j.tra.2022.06.015,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"The commitment in many countries to zero emissions at the tailpipe for buses opens up an era under transition with a new set of risks and uncertainties to both bus operators and the regulator. The switch to clean energy brings energy providers, both generators and distributors, as well battery pack and electric or hydrogen bus providers, and infrastructure specialists, into the mainstream of service provision, signifying that the risks in transition over the next 30 or so years should be shared amongst a larger set of upstream service providers who stand to gain through new opportunities from the transition. De-risking through greater sharing is common in many supply chain ventures and is an appealing way of transitioning to a green energy future for the provision of bus services. We promote the idea of a competitively defined supply chain partnership procurement model, implemented through tendering or negotiation, as a way of spreading the risk to all who will gain from this new future. This has the potential, without guarantee, to support many more bus operators staying in (or indeed entering) the industry to enable an effective competitive process, especially the relatively smaller operators who currently lack the expertise and knowledge to weather this transition, best described as an extreme event. This paper is a conceptual think piece rather than a scientific one, designed to open up new ways to consider procurement and contracting in the context of the transition to zero emission buses, but it has wider value in other sectors.",0965-8564,Not found
Covid-19 and optimal urban transport policy,10.1016/j.tra.2022.06.012,163,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Covid-19 has important implications for public transport operations. Increased teleworking and the perceived infection risk on public transport vehicles have drastically reduced demand in many cities. At the same time, physical distancing has effectively reduced available peak-period public transport capacity. In this paper, we use a simple model to study the effect of these changes on second-best optimal pricing and frequency provision, assuming that car use is underpriced. A numerical application reflecting the public transport situation in Brussel is provided. Results include the following. First, more telework and the increased perceived infection risk have opposite effects on the fare, so that it may be optimal not to change the fare at all. Optimal frequency is likely to decline. Second, holding the fare and frequency constant at their pre-Covid second-best optimal values, more telework reduces the public transport deficit if car use is underpriced. Third, extending the model to allow for passengers with different vulnerability towards Covid-19, allowing fare and frequency differentiation implies that vulnerable users will face higher fares only if their risk perception is sufficiently higher than that of the non-vulnerable, and car use is not too much underpriced. Occupancy rates will be lower for the vulnerable passengers. Fourth, the numerical results for Brussels show that telework and a high perceived infection risk for workers may yield a welfare optimum whereby commuters do almost not use public transport. Offering a low frequency suffices to deal with the captive demand by school children and students. Lastly, reserved capacity for the vulnerable users and stimuli for walking and biking to school may be useful policies to deal with the crowding risk.",0965-8564,Not found

We estimate route choice preferences using a path size logit model, and operationalize the coefficients for policy-making through ‘willingness-to-walk’ measures. The value of these measures is demonstrated through an application of computing pedestrian accessibility to transit stations. Additionally, we compare our findings to a previous study in San Francisco, CA using similar data and methods, and previous literature to explore similarities and differences in pedestrian route choice behavior across major metropolitan areas more generally.

Car careers: A socio-psychological evaluation of aspirational automobile ownership,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.001,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"There is a general consensus that private car ownership is a significant barrier to transport system change, specifically in regard to injuries, space, air pollutants, or greenhouse gas emissions. Observed changes in automobile characteristics also suggest that the system is becoming less sustainable, given trends towards larger cars with greater mass and horsepower. It is thus relevant to understand how the automobile system progresses. National statistics provide data on the technical side of car ownership, such as changes in vehicle specifics or national fleet size. This paper complements this view with a socio-psychological perspective on aspirational car ownership, i.e. the type of car people preferred to drive if given a free choice. Data is derived from an online panel (n = 1,211) representative of the German population, and also contains information on current car ownership, use, driving style, traffic behavior, attitudes towards traffic risks and safety measures, as well as political orientation.

This paper proposes a pattern match algorithm based on t-distribution stochastic neighbor embedding and K nearest neighbors (TSNE-KNN) to promote the prediction performance and introduces similarity indicators to explore these features of OD flow and their relationship with the forecasting performance. Analysis of automatic fare collection data of Beijing rail transit shows that the TSNE-KNN model is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches, even including deep neural network models, and the similarity, which is affected by the functional attributes of station, the surrounding land use attributes and the degree of development of the road network, can be a universal indicator to indirectly reflect the time–space properties of the OD flow. It is found that as the similarity of daily OD flows decreases, the performance of short-term OD prediction of decreases, and rail transit stations are gradually shifting from the periphery to the center of the city.",0965-8564,Not found
Will COVID-19 accelerate telecommuting? A cross-country evaluation for Israel and Czechia,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.011,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The COVID-19 crisis has forced many people to work from home, rather than at their regular workplace. This paper aims to assess the impact of the pandemic on telecommuting and commuting behavior after the end of the crisis: Will people embrace teleworking and reduce commuting, even to some extent, or will they resume their pre-pandemic work patterns? This study, implementing a cross-country survey from Israel and Czechia, combines data regarding revealed preferences about work habits before and during the pandemic and stated intentions data regarding anticipated work patterns when life returns to “normal” after the pandemic. Two models were used for the data analysis, one addressing factors that affect the increased/decreased teleworking trend and the other addressing factors that affect the frequency of actual commutes. The results reveal that most respondents (62% in Israel and 68% in Czechia) will maintain the same telecommuting/working from home balance. About 19% of respondents in both countries expressed their intention to reduce the number of commuting days, while 6% stated they would increase out-of-home days. However, these estimates rely only on workers’ expectations not accounting for employers’ point of view and other constraints they may have. Not accounting for potential bias, a moderate reduction of 6.5% and 8.7% (in Israel and in Czechia, respectively) in the number of commuting trips is expected in the post-pandemic era. The anticipated decrease in commuting days is accompanied by an increase in teleworking: from 10% to 14% among those who work more than 20 h a week (in both countries) and a drop in the rate of those who telework five hours or less a week (down from 73% to 63% in Israel and from 76% to 70% in Czechia). Self-employment, travel time to work, working solely on premise during the lockdown, and personal preferences regarding telework versus working away from home were found to significantly contribute to a decrease in the number of commuting days and to an increase in teleworking. An interesting finding is the high probability of increased teleworking among people who teleworked for the first time during the lockdown or who increased their teleworking time during the lockdown. This indicates that the teleworking experience due to the pandemic has enabled some people to view working from home as viable. Although, overall, the change in working habits does not seem dramatic, our results suggest that hybrid schemes for combining on premise and telework are expected to be adopted by some sectors.",0965-8564,Not found
Trust and perceived risk: How different manifestations affect the adoption of autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.022,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Although manufacturers and experts consider autonomous vehicles (AVs) as a much safer alternative than traditional human-driven vehicles, the lack of trust and high perceived risk by potential users can be a major obstacle to their acceptance. While both risk and trust have been the focus of interest for AV researchers, studies have often produced contradictory results. This study offers a new perspective to investigate the effect of trust and perceived risk to resolve these ambiguities. We identified three underlying dimensions of trust supplemented by two dimensions of risk and incorporated them into one model. The proposed model offers direct and indirect paths between trust dimensions and AV acceptance with the mediation of the dimensions of perceived risk. Based on a survey of 949 adult respondents, the model was tested with structural equation modeling (SEM). Results revealed that only performance trust affected directly intention to use AVs, while trust in manufacturers influenced intention to use with the mediation of privacy risk. An important result is that trust in institutions that can influence future rules and regulations for the use of AVs has no impact either directly or indirectly on intention to use. The practical implications can assist regulators and manufacturers to increase their efforts to build trust and confidence, thus enhancing the adoption of this technology.",0965-8564,Not found
Identifying and visualizing operational bottlenecks and Quick win opportunities for improving bus performance in public transport systems,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.005,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Congestion is one of the main problems prevalent in surface public transport systems. Congestion affects travel time, service regularity, and system costs. The accuracy of identification of speed-related problems depends on the quality and precision of the tools used to analyze the available operational data, that is, data on the impact on users and operational costs. Furthermore, traffic signals contribute significantly to operational delay, and programming traffic signals to prioritize transit can substantially increase the operating speeds. For example, green split redistributions are simple and low-cost adjustments to traffic signals that can significantly improve operating speeds. However, it might be expensive to collect the necessary traffic flow information. This study had a twofold contribution. First, it presents an extension of a tool that uses buses GPS data to identify and rank bottlenecks, in which queue lengths and bus load profiles are now considered for estimating user delay. Second, a methodology to identify which of these bottlenecks can be easily removed (Quick wins) by reallocating the traffic signal’s green times among phases. The modified methodology was applied in the city of Santiago de Chile, where the inclusion of both the queue length and bus load profiles is shown to modify the ranking. Additionally, Quick wins opportunities were detected and addressed resulting in an average 85% reduction in bus delays.",0965-8564,Not found
Will COVID-19 be the end for the public transit? Investigating the impacts of public health crisis on transit mode choice,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.020,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"COVID-19 had an unprecedented impact on transit demand and usage. Stiff and vigilant hygiene safety requirements changed travellers’ mode choice preferences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, transit modal share is radically impacted. Therefore, quantitative measurements on transit demand impact are urgently needed to facilitate evidence-based policy responses to COVID-19. Thus, we collected 1000 random samples through a web-based survey in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada, on traveler’s modal choices behavior during the COIVD-19 pandemic. The paper presents an analysis with this firsthand dataset to understand transit users' behavioral adaptation resulting from the spreading of COVID-19 in 2020. We found that the transit frequency dropped by 21% to 71% for various socioeconomic groups in the GTA during the pandemic. The transit modal share dipped for all trip purposes. For private vehicle owners, around 70% of transit users switched to their private vehicles. More than 60% of those without cars switched to active transport for all travel purposes. Also, ride-hailing services are the second most popular substitution of transit for them. More than 80% of the respondents agreed with all transit safety policies, such as mandatory face-covering listed in the survey. Moreover, a similar proportion of the respondents agreed to return to public transit in the future. Multinomial, nested, and mixed logit models are estimated to capture relationships between modal choices and various factors. We found that the daily number of new COVID-19 cases impacts the choice of transit negatively. However, vaccine availability and mandatory face-covering onboard positively affect travellers’ choices of riding transit during the pandemic.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact evaluation of a cycling promotion campaign using daily bicycle counters data: The case of Cycling May in Poland,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.017,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The promotion of active and sustainable transport modes as an alternative to motorised individual transport has become a key policy priority in Europe, to reduce air pollution, road congestion, noise, traffic injuries, and the adverse health outcomes of sedentary lifestyles. Policymakers are implementing a wide range of measures to encourage this shift in attitudes and behaviours. These interventions are most valuable when targeting children and young people, as they weigh in habit formation and result in longer term benefits. More specifically, soft transport policies include measures like informational and educational campaigns, marketing techniques, personalized services and incentives. Among this type of policies, the gamification approach based on a competition mechanism and relative reward is applied to promote cycling behaviour, especially directed towards children. In this study we evaluate the Cycling May policy, a wide campaign aimed at promoting commuting to school by bicycle and implemented in several cities in Poland, and targeting schoolchildren and their families. We apply a quasi-experimental design based on observed daily bicycle counts on bicycle lanes in the targeted city of Gdansk and in a control city, over a three-years period. Estimates from a difference-in-difference panel regression show that the policy generated a 18% average increase in daily bicycle traffic. Despite the positive estimated effect during the intervention, our findings suggest that the behavioural change is not sustained after the intervention ends, consistently with findings from similar research.",0965-8564,Not found
Intercity ridesharing to the rescue: Capacity flexibility and price stability of BlaBlaCar during the 2018 French railway strike,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.015,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The increased usage of alternative transportation modes during public transportation disruptions has been well documented in the literature. While many papers discuss the resilience of the disrupted mode or measure changes in the usage of various alternative modes, little research has addressed the capacity flexibility and the price fluctuations of the alternative modes—two important components of the quality of an alternative. This paper documents the capacity and price changes of BlaBlaCar during the nationwide French railway strike in 2018. We collected more than 1 million trip offers from the BlaBlaCar’s API from April to July 2018, covering 82 representative intercity routes in France. Our empirical analysis shows that, on an average strike day, the number of offered seats increased by approximately 6 %, while the number of booked seats rose by 33 %. Despite the spikes in demand, prices remained stable during the strike. We argue that the price recommendation mechanism helped maintain the price stability on the platform during the strike. The mechanism is in fact an effective enforcement of the policy laid down by the French government to uphold the cost-sharing principle on ridesharing platforms. This paper presents a case of voluntary compliance by a private company to put in place a price recommendation mechanism that in effect stabilizes prices and contributes to the resilience of the whole transportation system against abnormal market conditions.",0965-8564,Not found
"Effects of strict vehicle restrictions on various travel modes: A case study of Zhengzhou, China",10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.014,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Vehicle restriction policies are introduced worldwide to alleviate traffic congestion and promote public transportation trips. Many cities in China have been taking the one-day-per-week (ODPW) restriction policy as a regular traffic management measure, while in special cases, the stricter odd-and-even (OAE) vehicle restriction policy is implemented for contingency. However, empirical evidence on the impact of these restrictions on various transportation modes in cities remains lacking. By using multisource mass data of various travel modes in Zhengzhou, China, this study investigates the practical effects of strict vehicle restriction policies from two perspectives of resident trip characteristics, namely, travel demand of various travel modes (subways, buses, and ride-hailing services) and road network traffic conditions. Results highlight a significant increase in the travel demand of alternative travel modes as the policy shifted from ODPW to OAE, with ride-hailing orders enduring a greater impact than public transportation. The long-term impact of these policies on these travel modes, except for buses, tends to be moderate. While traffic conditions have significantly improved as a result of these policies, their effects on reducing the number of vehicles on the road are less than expected. This study contributes to a comprehensive interpretation of the effects of strict vehicle restrictions and provides insights for making rational policy decisions.",0965-8564,Not found
Spatial aggregation error and agglomeration benefits from transport improvements,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.004,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Aggregating data to other spatial resolutions can result in spatial aggregation errors, which can affect the data and subsequent analyses. This paper investigates the nature of spatial aggregation errors in the calculation of agglomeration benefits. The finding shows that inappropriate aggregation can result in significant errors in the monetised benefits used in transport appraisals. The error is analysed using both a stylised model and four case studies. Using arithmetic employment-weighted averages for transport costs when calculating the access to economic mass (ATEM) of the aggregated zones resulted in an error of +/-70%. An arithmetic trip-weighted average reduces errors. The error is further reduced using a harmonic employment-weighted average in the ATEM calculation, but it is not eliminated. The remaining error stems from the altered structure of the data stemming from the aggregation process, which is called the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP). Our findings, which concur with the broader MAUP literature, indicate that this error is unavoidable. Our policy recommendation is to calculate the agglomeration benefits as disaggregated as possible, but if aggregation is necessary, use the harmonic employment-weighted average for transport costs.",0965-8564,Not found
Policy and industry implications of the potential market penetration of electric vehicles with eco-cooperative adaptive cruise control,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.007,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The Eco-Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (Eco-CACC) makes use of an algorithm to compute energy-optimized speed profiles within the vicinity of signalized intersections. We conduct a stated choice experiment to unveil the inclination of drivers towards the Eco-CACC and to calculate its potential market share. To do so, we consider the performance of the system in field and simulated tests, as well as different types of drivers. Models of discrete choice are used to identify key elements in the adoption of this technology and its market penetration. The study has been performed for gasoline and electric vehicles, as well as for different categories of roads (arterial, highways and both), separately, exploring the effect of the advantages that the Eco-CACC features bring to both. Our results demonstrate, for the gasoline-powered, that potential purchasers perceive a clear trade-off between the cost of the system and the fuel savings that it provides. This is not the case for potential electric vehicles purchasers, for whom the cost-benefit analysis is adverse, mainly due to the low cost of electricity compared to gasoline. Nevertheless, the market shares resulting from the estimated models give a significant quota to the alternatives that include the Eco-CACC, resulting from favorable attitudes towards environmentally friendly technological innovations.",0965-8564,Not found
Quantifying the impact of pandemic lockdown policies on global port calls,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.002,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"The recent experience of lockdowns during COVID-19 highlights the prolonged impact a pandemic could have on ports and the shipping industry. This paper uses port call data derived from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports from the world’s 30 largest container ports to quantify both the immediate and longer-term impact of national COVID-19 lockdown policies on global shipping flows. The analysis uses the Difference-in-Difference (DID) and combined regression discontinuity design (RDD)-DID models to represent the effects of lockdown policies. The combination of RDD and DID models is particularly effective because it can mitigate time trends in the data, e.g., the Chinese New Year effect on Chinese ports. This study further examines the potential shock propagation effects, namely, how lockdown policy in one country (i.e., China) can affect the number of port calls in other countries. We categorize ports in other countries into a high-connectivity (with Chinese ports) group and a low-connectivity group, using a proposed connectivity index with China derived from individual vessel trajectories obtained from the AIS data. The results provide a clearly measurable picture of the kinds of trade shocks and consequent pattern changes in port calls over time caused by responses to lockdown policies of varying levels of stringency. We further document the existence of significant shock propagation effects. As the risk of pandemics rises in the twenty-first century, these results can be used by policy makers to assess the potential impact of different levels of lockdown policy on the maritime industry and trade flows more broadly. Maritime players can also use findings such as these to manage their capacity during lockdowns more effectively and to respond more flexibly to changing demand in seaborne transportation.",0965-8564,Not found
Persons with physical disabilities and autonomous vehicles: The perspective of the driving status,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.009,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Improving access to transportation and ensuring transportation equity for persons with physical disabilities is one of the global challenges. Autonomous vehicles are pointed out as the potential solution to these problems. The views of persons with physical disabilities about autonomous vehicles differed sharply and substantially compared to non-disabled and other persons with disabilities. Therefore, this paper investigates differences in acceptance of autonomous vehicles among different groups of persons with physical disabilities. The driving status criterion was used because this fact significantly impacts the quality of life and social status. The paper’s main contribution is to help create policies and practices related to autonomous vehicles following the real needs of persons with physical disabilities. The research was conducted in a country with vast problems of inclusion of persons with disabilities and transportation equity – Serbia. The Bayesian linear regression models were created with weakly informative prior distributions. We found that non-drivers with physical disabilities prefer to use autonomous vehicles more than drivers. The key issues of the successful introduction of autonomous vehicles are attitudes, accessibility, and trust. Autonomous vehicles present an excellent opportunity to improve mobility and transportation equity for non-drivers with physical disabilities. Transportation stakeholders, vehicle manufacturers, and representative associations of persons with disabilities should cooperate closely, respecting the concept „Nothing about us, without us.”. One solution for resolving recognized challenges is introducing autonomous vehicles in the public transport system following accessibility, reliability, and safety principles.",0965-8564,Not found
How to trade thirty thousand products: A wholesale market design for road capacity,10.1016/j.tra.2022.07.014,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"One of the core reasons for urban traffic congestion is the mispricing of the traffic’s main resource, the scarce road capacity. Recent proposals suggest a two-stage market for road capacity similar to other major utilities markets such as those for electricity. In such markets an Independent System Operator (ISO) provides road infrastructure which multiple Service Providers (SP) then resell to end consumers. The size of such markets in terms of the number of traded items, road segments per hour, is exceptional. A road network in a city consists of tens of thousands different road segments and it is unclear how a wholesale market for service providers should be designed to keep it tractable for buyers and sellers. Three problems arise in this context: First, how can a service provider express preferences for so many products. Second, the optimization problem is very large and it is far from obvious that problems of this size can be solved. Finally, the allocation problem is non-convex and finding competitive equilibrium prices on such markets is impossible in general. We suggest a parsimonious bid language based on origin–destination pairs and introduce a mixed-integer optimization problem to maximize welfare on such markets. Based on the MATSim traffic simulator, we show that one can solve realistic problems based on traffic data for the city of Berlin to optimality within 15 minutes. Importantly, we approximate competitive equilibrium prices which require only negligible side-payments as the allocation problem is “almost” convex. Overall, the paper provides a tangible proposal for wholesale markets for road capacity.",0965-8564,Not found
Characterising public transport shifting to active and private modes in South American capitals during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.010,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"During the year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic affected mobility around the world, significantly reducing the number of trips by public transport. In this paper, we study its impact in five South American capitals (i.e., Bogotá, Buenos Aires, Lima, Quito and Santiago). A decline in public transport patronage could be very bad news for these cities in the long term, particularly if users change to less sustainable modes, such as cars or motorbikes. Notwithstanding, it could be even beneficial if users selected more sustainable modes, such as active transport (e.g., bicycles and walking). To better understand this phenomenon in the short term, we conducted surveys in these five cities looking for the main explanation for changes from public transport to active and private modes in terms of user perceptions, activity patterns and sociodemographic information. To forecast people’s mode shifts in each city, we integrated both objective and subjective information collected in this study using a SEM-MIMIC model. We found five latent variables (i.e., COVID-19 impact, Entities response, Health risk, Life related activities comfort and Subjective well-being), two COVID-19 related attributes (i.e., new cases and deaths), two trip attributes (i.e., cost savings and time), and six socio-demographic attributes (i.e., age, civil status, household characteristics, income level, occupation and gender) influencing the shift from public transport to other modes. Furthermore, both the number of cases and the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 increased the probability of moving from public transport to other modes but, in general, we found a smaller probability of moving to active modes than to private modes.

Residential relocation and changes in household vehicle ownership and travel behavior: Exploring the context of Hubli-Dharwad twin-cities in India from a planning viewpoint,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.008,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"This article simultaneously analyzes residential relocation, vehicle ownership changes, and travel demand changes while accommodating potential self-selection effects to unravel the causal impacts of built environment features on vehicle ownership and travel behavior. Earlier studies on residential mobility have not considered the causal link from objective built environment features to subjective built environment, and rarely control for attitudes and objective built environment features in the empirical analysis. Besides, the literature has not discussed how households perceive neighborhood in terms of children's/women’s travel and how that changes by residential relocation and impact mobility decisions. The paper compares built environment impacts on mobility decisions in two adjacent areas in India, Hubli-Dharwad twin cities, that vary by socio-economic and land use contexts. The study notes that Dharwad residents acquired more personal vehicles than Hubli residents, while the proportion of households who relinquished their vehicles is high in Hubli. Post movement, Dharwad residents opted for areas with higher diversity and density than their counterparts in Hubli. In Hubli, households find that their current location does not help their children use active modes to schools, and women find jobs closer to home. The statistical analysis revealed that Hubli residents prefer locations with improved travel conveniences for women and children. With improvements in the children's travel friendliness, households of both cities decreased vehicle ownership, whereas household vehicle ownership of both cities increased with improvements in women’s travel friendliness. In Dharwad, moving to residential areas characterized by high land-use diversity reduces commute travel, while an inverse association is noted in Hubli. The statistical analysis did not confirm self-selection effects due to travel attitudes. In Dharwad, the latent factor on women’s travel friendliness featured in self-selection and shows an independent effect on vehicle ownership. In Hubli, the factor did not have independent effects on vehicle ownership after accommodating travel attitudes and socio-demographics.",0965-8564,Not found
Fare adjustment's impacts on travel patterns and farebox revenue: An empirical study based on longitudinal smartcard data,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.003,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Fare policy plays an important role in transit operations and management. To better coordinate and achieve the multidimensional goals of a proposed fare adjustment policy (e.g., increasing revenue, managing demand, and improving equity), a fundamental step is to evaluate its travel pattern impacts, which helps us consider the policy in a bigger socioeconomic context. Existing studies rarely investigate the impacts of such a policy on different users’ and user groups’ travel patterns and transit operators’ farebox revenue using longitudinal data from sources such as smartcard data. To fill this gap, we exploit 24 weeks’ smartcard data from Wuhan, China, to empirically quantify those impacts. We find that (a) the fare increase had significant but varying impacts on travel patterns across users and user groups; (b) confronting the fare increase, commuter groups identified by the topic model reduced their trip frequency more but later as compared to other groups; (c) low-accessibility, long-distance, and single-destination metro riders were less sensitive to the fare increase; (d) when there was a system-wide fare increase with a distance-based structure, trip purposes and socioeconomic statuses could better predict the impacts on the travel demand and farebox revenue than spatiality. These findings indicate that increasing average fares while offering discounted tickets for frequent and/or captive riders could maintain the existing ridership and farebox revenue and possibly increase additional ridership.",0965-8564,Not found
A comparative economic assessment of urban transport infrastructure options in low- and middle-income countries,10.1016/j.tra.2022.07.019,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Several innovative public transport (PT) projects have been developed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where cars, motorcycles and buses share the facilities. However, there seems to be very little evidence on assessment methods to analyse the feasibility of different PT modes and identify the most cost-effective mixed transport system. To address this issue, this study develops a comparative economic assessment (CEcoA) based on the PT technologies’ characteristics and the conditions of local transport networks. The assessment integrates four models. First, a social cost model (SCM), that calculates the social costs of each mode and mixed transport systems, is the key model in the assessment. Second, an incremental elasticity analysis (IEA) evaluates changes in total demand by using the demand elasticity with respect to a composite cost. The IEA solves the first drawback of the SCM that demand is assumed to be fixed. Third, an incremental logit model (ILM) estimates changes in modal shares with respect to generalised costs. The ILM overcomes the second disadvantage of the SCM, where preferences of users for all alternative transport modes are not considered. Fourth, a microscopic simulation model (MSM) simulates all existing transport modes’ flows on the local network. The MSM solves the third drawback of the SCM, which only considers an isolated corridor without any interaction between the different modes and any junctions. The assessment was applied to compare an existing mixed transport situation and twelve options with an introduction of new PT technologies (Bus Rapid Transit - BRT, elevated Metro and Monorail) replacing the existing bus services; either wholly or partially, and with or without a congestion charge scheme for private transport (PRV) on a corridor in Hanoi, Vietnam in terms of average social cost (ASC), total demand and PT share. The results show that eight options with BRT or Monorail or Metro are feasible, whilst the BRT option that replaces all existing buses and includes congestion charging is the best alternative in terms of ASC. Transport planners and decision makers can draw on the findings of this research. A congestion charge scheme might be considered for the local conditions to meet specific objectives such as a reduction in ASCs and an increase in modal share of PT. The CEcoA can be a strategic tool for not only planning new PT technologies on corridors in the whole network but also retrospectively evaluating investments of PT modes. Moreover, the methodology of the CEcoA might be applied and modified to various transport networks with an abundance of motorcycles to assess the costs and benefits of new PT modes and mixed transport systems with or without the congestion charge.",0965-8564,Not found
Electric vehicles adoption behaviour: Synthesising the technology readiness index with environmentalism values and instrumental attributes,10.1016/j.tra.2022.07.009,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Since the introduction of Electric Vehicles (EVs) into the consumer market, the most important question has been how to persuade people to adopt this product. This is a very challenging mission for the industry and governments due to the nature of the product. It is a revolutionary innovation which means that it imposes major shifts in driving behaviour. The adoption rate however is slowly growing worldwide. Previous studies have shed light on the mechanism in which consumers express willingness to purchase EVs, mainly from the perspective of instrumental attributes (the perceived functional aspects of EVs) and the environmentalism values. This paper includes some behavioural traits to previous prediction models as plausible drivers to purchase EVs: Technology Readiness Index (TRI), and Desire for Unique Consumer Products (DUCP). These traits were synthesised with the aforementioned instrumental attributes and environmentalism values to offer a broad perspective on what drives the purchase intention of EVs. This study was conducted in the UK through intercept survey, with a sample size of 336 individuals. The results suggest that TRI, manifested through innovativeness and insecurity towards technology, is a significant driver of EV purchase intention. In addition, three instrumental factors, namely driving range, convenience, and fuel costs, were found as significant predictors. Unlike previous studies that suggest EVs should be targeted towards environmentalist consumers, this study found weaker support for this claim. DUCP was also not found to be a significant factor, contrary to previous findings.

The spillover effect of HSR is larger than the direct effect. (2) The largest spillover effect occurs in adjacent areas near 350 km apart, while the spillover effect disappears beyond 500 km.

Liberalization experiences and research have shown that high-powered incentives lead to safety hazards, lack of service in low-demand areas, and poor service quality. Fixed-wage schemes, common in tendered systems, are among the leading causes of increased fare evasion, as drivers do not control payment adequately. In a controlled experimental setting, we show that team-based incentives induce levels of effort similar to those provided by an individual pay-for-performance scheme but without undesirable operational decisions. We find that team contracts eliminate the conflict of interest between drivers, causing drivers to control the passengers’ payment while maintaining more regular speeds. Consequently, reducing safety hazards and rushing through low-demand stops, avoiding excessive waiting times, and keeping a uniform distribution in the passenger load. These characteristics are absent in the individual contract and are a crucial part of the quality of service.",0965-8564,Not found
Spatial variation of ridesplitting adoption rate in Chicago,10.1016/j.tra.2022.07.018,164,2022-10-01,2022,10,"Ridesplitting, a form of ride-hailing service where passengers with similar travel routes are matched to the same driver, can reduce the negative effects of solo ride-hailing trips and bring various environmental and social benefits.

To fill the gap, this work investigates the spatial variation of ridesplitting adoption rate (the proportion of ride-hailing trips with shared trip authorized, RAR) and its association with built environment and socio-economic factors at the census tract level, using the ride-hailing trip data in Chicago. To addressing the spatial heterogeneity, geographically weighted regression models are established to detect the factors influencing the RAR during different time periods, such as weekday, weekend, weekday morning peak and evening peak. Modeling results show that GWR models outperform the traditional global models in terms of model fit. The census tract level factors including subway station density, frequency of transit, land use mix, homicide density, percent female, the share of nonwhite, and percent zero-vehicle households have impacts on RAR, and the coefficient estimates of each explanatory variable vary across regions. The research results can help urban planners and transportation network companies develop refined policies to promote shared ride-hailing trips.",0965-8564,Not found

Can MaaS change users’ travel behaviour to deliver commercial and societal outcomes?,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.004,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Mobility as a Service, or MaaS, is a relatively new business model that aims to disrupt the passenger transport industry by integrating existing mobility services into an intuitive smartphone app that allows everyday travellers to search, book, use, and pay for all their transport needs. In a fully integrated ecosystem, MaaS is envisaged to integrate not only travel information and payment, but also mobility services and societal goals to obtain the so-called four levels of MaaS integration. This paper empirically assesses the prospects of having a commercially viable and environmentally sustainable MaaS. Leveraging high-quality data collected by GPS-tracking technology, ticketing management systems, and survey questionnaires over the five-month in-field trial of MaaS in Sydney, this paper develops a discrete-count modelling system to quantify, for the first time, the impacts of MaaS on users’ travel behaviour and extra volume/revenue for shared modes. Based on the quantitative evidence obtained, the paper suggests a new commercial model for MaaS and identifies the likely opportunities and challenges faced by MaaS integrators.",0965-8564,Not found
Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on foreign trade intermodal transport accessibility: Evidence from the Yangtze River Delta region of mainland China,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.019,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"We address the problem of the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on foreign trade transport by introducing a foreign trade intermodal transport accessibility (FTITA) index. First, we present the definition of FTITA, which combines the convenience of transporting domestic cargoes to overseas regions by an international intermodal transport network and the trade attractiveness of the domestic cargoes in the overseas regions. Second, we analyze the path choice behaviors of domestic shippers and propose the measurement method of the FTITA index. Finally, using the 41 cities in the Yangtze River Delta region in mainland China as origins and eight overseas regions as destinations, we empirically analyze the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on the FTITA. With the empirical study conducted in the prepandemic and postpandemic years, we analyzed the overall trends of the FTITAs from the YRD region to eight overseas regions, spatial patterns of the distributions of the FTITAs in the YRD region, rankings of average FTITA values for the top ten cities in the YRD region, and the FTITAs for different cargoes. The results indicate that the FTITAs of the YRD region in the prepandemic year are significantly higher than those in the postpandemic year. Moreover, in both the prepandemic and postpandemic years, the FTITAs to North America, Japan/South Korea, Europe, and Southeast Asia are significantly higher than those to Oceania, Middle East, South America, and Africa. Through analysis of the spatial patterns of the FTITAs across cities in the YRD region, we find that the cities with high FTITA are mainly close to Shanghai Port and Ningbo Port; the cities with middle-high FTITA are mainly located in southern Zhejiang and the regions along the Yangtze River; the cities with middle-low FTITA are mainly located in northern Jiangsu; and the cities with low FTITA are located in northern Anhui. Furthermore, comparing the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on the FTITAs for different cargoes, we observe that COVID-19 has the least impact on foodstuffs and event cargoes. Our findings can guide decision makers in implementing policies for alleviating the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on foreign trade transport and further promoting the sustainable development of port and shipping industries.",0965-8564,Not found
Assessing the perception of E-scooters as a practical and equitable first-mile/last-mile solution,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.021,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"E-scooters have disrupted and altered the urban mobility landscape. During their introductory period, they have been commonly touted as part of a larger micromobility solution that erases equity barriers and solves the first-mile/last-mile problem. However, few studies in the nascent e-scooter literature have considered these claims. In this study, we used a d-efficient method to design and administer a stated choice experiment (SCE) to students at Portland State University (PSU) (n = 1,968). In the SCE, students were given a three-mode labelled choice set consisting of three travel modes: car, bike, and e-scooter + MAX light rail. (The e-scooter + MAX light rail choice is multimodal, with the e-scooter acting as the first-mile access mode). We generated attitudinal indices using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) in order to control for mode perception. To demonstrate the relationship of travel time and cost in addition to other covariates on mode choice, we estimated a mixed multinomial logit (MMNL) model. We performed elasticity and sensitivity analyses to uncover factors that encouraged first-mile/last-mile e-scooter usage. We then used the model to generate catchment area maps for multimodal trips in the Portland area. Results indicated that e-scooters were lackluster in bringing racial and gender equity in transportation. Additionally, we found that there was no place in Portland where combining an e-scooter and light rail to travel to PSU was most utilitarian compared to bike or private car. This suggests that e-scooters are not perceived as a preferred solution to the first-mile/last-mile problem. Yet, our findings revealed “dials” that can be tweaked through policy measures in order to promote this kind of use, including parking pricing, travel times, fares, and traveler attitudes towards modes. Overall, our analysis of the implementation of e-scooters suggests that their promise is overstated, at least without substantial policy changes to encourage desired use cases.",0965-8564,Not found
"High-speed rail, market access, and the rise of consumer cities: Evidence from China",10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.012,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"This study examines the impact of high-speed rail (HSR) on the formation of consumer cities in China. We employ the market access (MA) approach and construct the least-cost path spanning tree network as an instrument to estimate the causal impact of HSR development on the socio-economic changes of counties from 2007 to 2016. Through a set of instrumental variable regressions, we find that districts with high MA growth experienced service sector agglomeration, manufacturing sector decentralization, and land price appreciation. These effects are relatively large for the urban districts of first- and second-tier Chinese cities. Through counterfactual analysis, we find that the absence of an HSR network decreases the growth of the number of service firms and service land price by 6.11% and 52.2%, respectively. These results suggest that HSR plays a key role in the rise of consumer cities by improving market access/integration, which transfers the economic structure from production to consumption.",0965-8564,Not found
"Measures of accessibility incorporating time reliability for an urban rail transit network: A case study in Wuhan, China",10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.011,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Time Reliability (TR) affects the accessibility of an Urban Rail Transit Network (URTN), which refers to the reachability of destination stations in this paper. However, existing studies do not incorporate TR into accessibility metrics when measuring a URTN’s accessibility. Here, the Buffer Time Index (BTI), which is the ratio of extra “buffer” time needed for arriving reliably to the average Travel Time (TT), is used to measure TR. Time-based, cost-based, and timebound-destination-reachability metrics which incorporate TR are proposed to measure the accessibility of a URTN. A Monte Carlo simulation is applied to estimate TR according to the probability distributions of TT components, which overcomes the difficulty of obtaining many passengers’ data. The accessibility of Wuhan’s URTN during weekday morning peak hours indicates that the metrics which do not consider TR overestimate a URTN’s accessibility. The evaluation results can effectively guide decisions on improvements to a URTN’s accessibility. The advantage of the measures of accessibility incorporating TR for a URTN is that they not only improve the reasonableness of evaluation but also reflect an aspect of great concern to passengers.",0965-8564,Not found
Is mass rapid transit applicable for deep integration of freight-passenger transport?

This paper explores new prospects to achieve extensive non-road city logistics based on a deep freight-on-rail-transit (FoRT) strategy. To begin, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of deep FoRT are analyzed in view of the development status quo of urban China. Next, a multi-criteria assessment model driven by real-world data and 11 quantified metrics is proposed to judge the suitability for developing the MRT-based integrated logistics system (MILS) in 16 Chinese cities. Finally, critical factors influencing MILS project adoption are explicated, and the possible supportive policies are discussed from aspects of planning, regulation, funding, marketization, and innovations. Results show that the alignment with national development goals, rich social-environmental benefits, and stakeholder interest are the primary drivers of deep FoRT strategy, whereas poor planning and decision-making, governance and management deficiencies, and high investment could be the main hurdles. Priority of MILS project adoption in the selected cities is divided into four tiers, where Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen are recognized as the three best candidates. Strong and coordinated policies are needed to integrate the strategy into urban planning.",0965-8564,Not found
Airline reactions to high-speed rail entry: Rail quality and market structure,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.016,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Airfare reduction is proposed by a theoretical paper to be a possible source of observed air traffic increase in some markets where high-speed rail (HSR) enters and competes with airlines. This paper aims to empirically test whether and to what extent the air traffic impact is channeled by the adjustment in airfares. To understand the varying empirical results found in the literature, we examine heterogeneous airline responses in traffic and airfare in relation to HSR qualities measured by HSR-air travel time difference and pre-entry market structure of airline as well as decompose HSR impacts into competition, feeding and long-term effects. Using a panel dataset of Chinese air routes, we find that airfare adjustment plays crucial roles in channeling HSR’s air traffic impact. Our estimation suggests that HSR introduced over 16.5 million additional passengers to the sampled air routes in our study period, generating 2.17 million tons of extra CO2 emissions from air flights. However, these numbers would increase to 32.2 million additional passengers and 3.4 million tons of extra CO2 emissions after removing the price adjustment.",0965-8564,Not found
Heterogeneity in the transfer time of air-rail intermodal passengers based on ticket booking data,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.022,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Transfer constitutes the weakest link in air-rail integrated services (ARISs). Air-rail passengers face problems such as long transfer times, complex transfer processes and poor transfer experiences, which seriously reduces ARIS competitiveness. The transfer time, as the most direct and objective measurement of transfer behavior, is important in ARIS planning, construction and operation. This paper aims to analyze the influence of transfer time on the use of ARIS using ticket booking data. The air-rail intermodal passengers are classified into three groups according to the social demographical attributes and trip characteristics using a latent class clustering model, namely passengers departing on weekdays for medium- or long-distance trips, passengers departing on weekdays for medium- or short-distance trips and passengers departing during weekends for medium- or long-distance trips. After that, a generalized ordered logistic regression (GOL) model is employed to identify the key factors influencing the transfer behavior of these three passenger groups. The results indicate that ticket-related attributes have the greatest impact on passenger transfer behavior, followed by transfer-related attributes, and operation-related attributes have the least impact. The effects of operation- and transfer-related attributes on transfer behavior among the different passenger groups are similar, but the ticket price, travel distance and travel time impose distinct effects on transfer behavior in the different passenger groups. Finally, some relevant recommendations to improve the ARIS are discussed.",0965-8564,Not found
"Air travel choice, online meeting and passenger heterogeneity – An international study on travellers’ preference during a pandemic",10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.020,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"This study empirically identifies business travellers’ preferences during the COVID-19 pandemic across different regions. A stated preference study was conducted during April to June 2021 on respondents in the U.S., the city of Shanghai in mainland China and Hong Kong. Generalised mixed multinomial logit (GMXL) models are estimated incorporating attributes of travel characteristics, severity levels of the pandemic, and health control measures at the airport. When an online meeting is inapplicable, respondents from Shanghai and Hong Kong highly value heath control measures, and are not sensitive to the time spent at airport health checkpoints. In comparison, U.S. respondents are averse to the time spent for health check, the reporting of personal information, travel history, symptoms, and the requirements of compulsory mask wearing and onsite sample testing. However, when online meeting is applicable, all the respondents show no appreciation for health control measures, while the U.S. respondents are twice more averse to the time spent at airport health checkpoints. Online meeting reduces the intention of international business travel amid the pandemic for passengers in Shanghai and Hong Kong, but imposes no significant effects on U.S. travellers. Such significant heterogeneity in traveller preference partly explains the different recovery patterns observed in various aviation markets, and justifies individualized travel arrangements and service priority in fulfilling pandemic control requirements across different regions. Our study also suggests that there are commonly accepted areas for global cooperation such as the sharing of vaccination record, and the option of online meeting calls for convenient travel arrangements amid pandemic to all countries.",0965-8564,Not found
Improving freight transportation performance through sustainability best practices,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.009,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"In recent years, integrating sustainability into the freight transportation (FT) system is progressively gaining global attention. The adoption of sustainability best practices acts as a critical link between the integration process and the sustainable performance of freight transporters. The principal objective of this study is, therefore, to propose a list of best sustainability practices relevant to the FT system. This study considers India a suitable context for the research as environmental emissions due to FT in India are substantially increasing with the upsurge in freight demand. It is, therefore, imperative to embed sustainability values within the freight operations to minimize the environmental and societal implications of freight movements. This study identifies twenty-four sustainability best practices through an extensive literature review, which are clustered into four main categories, namely (a) organizational, (b) process-oriented, (c) technological, and (d) collaborative sustainability practices. These practices are further quantified and prioritized using an integrated approach that innovatively combines intuitionistic fuzzy numbers with the graph theoretic and matrix approach. The quantification and prioritization processes were carried out using expert opinions collected through focus group sessions. Unlike conventional perception, the results of the study show that top management commitment, multi-modal freight transportation, and adoption of green technologies have a higher share of impact on the overall performance of the freight organization. The proposed study is one of the few works, which may act as a guideline for managers and decision-makers seeking to integrate sustainability into freight operations. From the perspective of methodological contribution, this is the first study in the freight transportation literature that has integrated intuitionistic fuzzy numbers with graph-theoretic and matrix approach. One of the uniqueness of the proposed integrated model is that it evaluates both the negative and positive influences of sustainability practices on the freight transporter’s economic, environmental, social, operational, and technological performance.",0965-8564,Not found
CIAM: A data-driven approach for classifying long-term engagement of public transport riders at multiple temporal scales,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.002,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Many human activities, including daily travel, show a mix of stable, intermittent and changing patterns in demand by individuals over time. However, the lack of continuous, long-term, passenger-linked data for public transport (PT) journeys means that we do not know how passenger ridership evolves in real-world networks. This paper proposes the CIAM model for classifying long-term passenger engagement with PT. CIAM is a data-driven model combining year-on-year churn (C), monthly intensity (I), annual (A) and multi-year (M) engagement. Parameter search algorithms are used to ensure that the learned features are distinctive and robust. We evaluated CIAM using a 5-year dataset from a PT network with over 300 million journeys. CIAM identified distinct patterns of long-term ridership at multiple time scales. Although the total number of annual journeys was relatively stable over the five years, we found long-term differences between passenger subgroups. Churn of passengers was a major factor in ridership with only 55% of passengers retained from year to year. Patterns of annual engagement are often intermittent, so short-term snapshots of a few weeks are typically not good indicators for longer term engagement. Only 27% of high-frequency, full-fare riders still have the same level of engagement four years later, compared with 55% who continue high-frequency engagement after only one year.",0965-8564,Not found
Shifts in perspective: Operational aspects in (non-)autonomous ride-pooling simulations,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.001,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"On-demand ride-pooling systems have gained increasing attention in science and practice in recent years. Simulation studies have shown an enormous potential to reduce fleet sizes and vehicle kilometers traveled if private car trips are replaced with ride-pooling services. However, existing simulation studies assume operation with autonomous vehicles, with no restrictions on operational tasks required when the vehicles are operated by manual drivers. In this article, we simulate and evaluate the operational challenges of non-autonomous ride-pooling systems through driver shifts and breaks and compare their capacity and efficiency to autonomous on-demand services. Based on the existing ride-pooling service MOIA in Hamburg, Germany, we introduce shift and break schedules and implement a new hub return logic to perform the respective tasks at different types of vehicle hubs. This way, currently operating on-demand services are modeled more realistically and the efficiency gains of such services through autonomous vehicles are quantified. The results suggest that operational challenges substantially limit the ride-pooling capacity in terms of served rides with a given number of vehicles. While results largely depend on the chosen shift plan, the presented operational factors should be considered for the assessment of current operational real-world services. The contribution of this study is threefold: From a technical perspective, it is shown that the explicit simulation of operational constraints of current services is crucial to assess ride-pooling services. From a policy perspective, the study shows the operational challenges of a ride-pooling service with non-autonomous vehicles and the potential of future autonomous services. Lastly, the paper adds to the literature a practical ride-pooling simulation use case based on observed real-world demand and shift data.",0965-8564,Not found
How do age and gender influence the acceptance of automated vehicles? – Revealing the hidden mediating effects from the built environment and personal factors,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.015,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Although existing research identified influences of age and gender on Automated Vehicle (AV) acceptance, the underlying reasons were not revealed. A potential reason is that age and gender are exogenous variables, which do not change by other variables. There must exist endogenous variables, such as the built environment and personal factors, such as affordability, travel needs, exposure to AV knowledge, acting as mediating factors that bridge the exogenous variables and AV acceptance. However, these mediating effects have not been discovered, validated, and quantified. Therefore, this paper provides a new viewpoint in unveiling how ages and genders influence acceptance of AV by quantitatively revealing hidden mediating effects focusing on the built environment and personal factors. A statewide survey was conducted in Kentucky. Besides demographical information, respondents’ personal information such as travel needs, affordability, exposure to AV knowledge, and the built environment were collected. Results reveal that males with high levels of travel needs and affordability better accept AV due to higher familiarity and more experience riding AV. Younger adults are more likely to have higher AV acceptance levels than older adults because younger adults tend to live in an urban setting with higher exposure levels to AV technology. Results suggest that experience in riding an AV, the most influential factor, improves acceptance by 44.8%. The research informs transportation agencies of a better understanding of how people of different ages and genders accept AV.",0965-8564,Not found
Transfer station choice in a multimodal transit system: An empirical study,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.014,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Connectivity between modes and lines constitutes a core aspect for multimodal transport system user experiences. Using a large-scale transit smart card dataset, we reveal transfer station choices in bus–rail intermodal trips frequently deviate from the “nearest-station” heuristics, motivating research to better explain real transfer behaviors and define more realistic station catchment areas. The investigation is centered on modeling transfers from bus to rail using multinomial logistic regression discrete choice models applied to 200k observations from four weeks of transit smart card observations. The results show that: (1) for trips requiring an intermodal transfer, riders select the nearest rail station in only 40% of cases; (2) commuters’ transfer station selections are jointly influenced by the trip attributes of all involved modes, with the bus ride distance contributing the most, followed by the walking distance; and (3) commuters’ sensitivity to travel distances exhibits nonlinear trends: sensitivity to bus ride distance dampens gradually as a function of trip length, while the sensitivity to walking distance exhibits a concave shape peaking at around 0.6 km. Catchment area modeling reveals that (4) location attributes (e.g., distance from the city center) play a greater role in defining the station catchment area than other attributes (e.g., land use and built environment). Specifically, the catchment area radius is larger for stations located further away from the city center or from the nearest interchange station. Moreover, (5) stations with more amenities (e.g., higher density of shops and greater accessibility) are likely to attract commuters from a larger area. This study strengthens the connections between station selection patterns and station catchment area analysis, to better guide intermodal transit design and operations, such as improving predictions of passenger flows at transfer stations.",0965-8564,Not found

Pedestrian traffic in pedestrian zones decreases with higher local incidence values, and with stricter government intervention. There are ambiguous effects for cycling, which decreases in cities with a higher modal share of cycling, and increases in others. Moreover, we find impact heterogeneity with respect to different weekdays and hours of the day, both for cycling and walking. Additionally, we use data on overall mobility changes, which were derived from mobile phone data, in order to estimate the modal share changes of cycling.

The logit models are estimated using revealed trip origin and destination responses from a travel survey that are augmented by land use and transit system data to provide contexts about the zones' trip generation and attraction potentials. For empirical analysis, the methodology is applied to the smart card system of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Specifically, it is tested under different system configurations (tap-on-only and tap-on-and-off) and for networks with substantial shares of automobile and walk access/egress. When applied to transit trips constructed from the smart card transactions, the estimated models successfully capture the spatial distribution of trip origin and destination at the traffic analysis zone level. The empirical analysis also demonstrates that the proposed fusion method can be appropriately used to reconcile information provided by transit smart card and travel surveys to generate up-to-date transit demand data necessary for public transport planning and operations.",0965-8564,Not found
Task-allocation among adult household members by activity purpose and accompanying person,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.012,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"This paper investigates household task allocation decisions for non-work activity episodes by activity purpose and accompanying person arrangements. The paper utilizes activity-travel behavior information of all adult members (above 19 years) from a family to model the activity episodes aggregated at the household level. Such an approach gives a better perspective on the latent propensity of household members to engage in out-of-home activities. The nature (substitution or complementary) of the inter- and intra-group interaction between household and non-household members is examined using a multivariate ordered probit model estimated on activity-travel behavior survey data, consisting of 1335 households and 3639 adult individuals, collected in Bhubaneswar Municipal Region, India. The exploratory analysis sheds light on the preferences of household members for pursuing an activity episode (shopping, pure escort, other maintenance, physically active recreation, and physically passive recreation) either alone or jointly with immediate family members or non-household (extended family members or members from social circle) members. The correlation matrix consisting of 19 dimensions suggests significant inter-group substitution effects across the four accompaniment types for different non-work activities. The intra-group effects are complementary in the case of joint pursuits highlighting the likelihood of adult household members adhering to the same accompanying group. The model also suggests that the effect of individual characteristics, household socio-demographics, and seasonal and temporal characteristics are more impactful than vehicle ownership and built environment features.

The analysis includes both a qualitative as well as a quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessment consists of a literature review of existing studies about EV charging behaviour and an analysis of semi-structured interviews with Danish EV users. This assessment identifies the most relevant factors for charging. In addition, it highlights that the time horizon of the charging decision is an essential factor. We use this to design two stated-choice (SC) experiments explicitly taking these findings into account. The first SC experiment looks into long-term decisions related to regular charging practices. The second SC experiment captures decisions related to occasional charging needs on longer trips. The SC data consist of three responses from 558 EV owners for each of the two experiments. We model the data using mixed logit models to allow for unobserved heterogeneity and the repeated nature of the SC data. The main findings indicate a high preference for all-inclusive/flat fee pricing structures. Moreover, they show that respondents value interoperability between charging networks, both nationally and internationally. Related to occasional charging, we find willingness-to-pay measures describing the detour respondents are willing to drive to obtain lower costs, a higher likelihood of available chargers, and facilities at the charging location. Overall the analyses highlight many factors that influence the charging decisions of consumers that are relevant for policymakers and charging operators.

Deriving transport appraisal values from emerging revealed preference data,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.016,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Transport demand models are widely used to inform policy making and produce forecasts of future demand. A core output derived from demand models is the Value of Travel Time (VTT), which provides insights on the trade-offs that travellers are willing to make in terms of travel time and travel cost. VTT estimates are a critical input to cost-benefit analyses and feasibility assessments of potential projects and thus play a crucial role in transport planning and policy decisions. While much of the early work on VTT made use of revealed preference (RP) data, their use decreased due to growing concerns about reporting errors that may result in omitted observations and measurement errors in the model inputs. As a consequence, VTT measures have, for the last two decades, primarily been estimated using state-preference (SP) surveys. While SP methods can assess the individual trade-offs in a controlled manner, they are prone to behavioural incongruence. More recently, RP data from passively-collected data sources have raised the promise of accounting for some of the limitations of traditional RP surveys due to the minimal (or even no) active input from the respondent. The present study utilises such a dataset that combined a 2-week trip diary captured through smartphone GPS tracking with a household survey containing individual socio-demographic information. A mixed Logit model for mode choice was specified and the estimated parameters were then applied on the National Travel Survey to calculate the VTT estimates. Those estimates were further adjusted based on trip distances to get more representative national VTT values. This process resulted in estimates similar to the official UK guidelines used in transport appraisal that were obtained from SP data, where our results are not affected by concerns about response quality or survey artefacts. The findings hence strengthen the case for shifting towards passively generated RP data sources and are important for transport practitioners.",0965-8564,Not found
Do corporate social responsibility ratings have any effect on traffic congestion?,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.005,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Traffic congestion (TC) is a complex issue that has an adverse impact on the environment, business operations, livability, and health of a community. Supply-side TC mitigation measures increase transportation capacities while demand-side measures attempt to modify travel behavior so that the travel demand is reduced. As part of the demand-side, some corporations are investing in TC reduction through actions that contribute to improved walkability, reduced peak travel demand, and active commuting. While beneficial for their local communities, TC reduction efforts are not specifically tagged as a part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) endeavors. CSR involves reporting of a company’s stewardship towards its community and environmental impact. Research reflecting on the impact of CSR on TC has not been conducted. This study aims to fill this gap. Using corporations headquartered in the top traffic-congested cities in the United States, this study examines the relationship between TC and CSR. This research employed a hierarchical linear model with two datasets, Travel Time Index (TTI) and CSRHub ratings. Of the four CSR categories studied, community, employees, and environment ratings are significantly related to TTI, with employees and environment ratings having an inverse relationship to TTI. This shows that congestion has a strong impact on the environment and that companies, through their employee policies, can impact TC. The results also highlight the opportunities that companies have in potentially reducing their environmental impact by incorporating congestion reduction strategies as part of their CSR, either as a separate measure or as part of their environmental or employee CSR ratings.

The impact of high-occupancy vehicle lanes on carpooling,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.021,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Since the 1970s, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes have been a common policy instrument to mitigate traffic congestion. Yet, their effectiveness remains a controversial topic among researchers, policy makers, and the public. In this debate, a key unknown has been the impact of HOV lanes on commuters’ carpooling behaviors. This paper brings a new piece of evidence by offering a data-driven assessment of carpooling intent and adoption, using revealed-preferences data. We partner with Waze, a major carpooling platform, and leverage a natural experiment following the introduction of three HOV lanes in Israel in 2019. Using tailored treatment and control groups coupled with econometric analyses, we derive four main findings. First, HOV lanes bring new users to the carpooling platform, which contributes to alleviating the “cold-start” problem in the marketplace. Second, HOV lanes have a positive impact on carpool intent: the number of carpool offers sent by drivers increase manifold following the introduction of the HOV lanes. Third, HOV lanes have a disparate impact on carpool adoption: carpools increase significantly for two out of three HOV lanes. This result underscores the critical impact of HOV lanes design: it seems more beneficial to have round-trip HOV lanes (as opposed to one-way lanes) and two-passenger occupancy requirements (as opposed to three-passenger requirements). Last, HOV lanes have a broader impact, by increasing carpooling on non-HOV routes and shifting the travel behaviors of non-carpoolers. We conclude by discussing policy implications, highlighting collaboration opportunities between policy makers and digital carpooling platforms to enhance the design and operations of HOV lanes.",0965-8564,Not found
When are new energy vehicle incentives effective? Empirical evidence from 88 pilot cities in China,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.003,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Incentive policies play an essential role in the rapid expansion of new energy vehicles (NEVs). Based on a comprehensive panel dataset, this paper investigates the effectiveness of various demand-side incentives in 88 NEV pilot cities in China. First, to explore where policies work effectively, we segment the pilots into several categories and conduct group regression. The results indicate that purchase restriction policies are effective in cities with poor air quality or large sizes. Use restrictions take effect only in cities with poor traffic infrastructure. Charge subsidies work in cities with good air quality or good traffic infrastructure. Second, to measure the contribution of policies, we conduct Shapley decomposition and reveal that the policy mix accounts for 16.9–47.6 % of the variation in NEV sales in distinct city categories. The empirical results of the decomposition also confirm the tendency of a transition from policy-driven to market-driven in the NEV industry. Third, to further validate the role of purchase subsidies, we consider the policy removal event in 2019 as a quasi-natural experiment and demonstrate that the removal of local purchase subsidy had a significant, negative effect on NEV sales. In light of the above findings, we suggest that policymakers avoid making one-size-fits-all policies and design precise and personalized policies, such as purchase restrictions (charge subsidies) for cities with poor (good) air quality. Moreover, a long-term, dynamic subsidy scheme remains necessary for the current stage.",0965-8564,Not found
A game-theoretic approach to an oligopolistic transportation market: Coopetition between incumbent systems subject to the entrance threat of an HSR service,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.006,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"We investigate pricing competition between passenger transportation modes in a transportation market by using a game-theoretic approach. Airplane and intercity bus operators are considered as incumbent; while a High-Speed Rail (HSR) operator decides on whether or not to enter the market. If the incumbent operators evaluate the entrance threat of HSR as serious, they have two alternatives: a barrier pricing strategy (BPS) to deter its entrance, and an accommodation pricing strategy (APS). Their interaction involves two competitive and cooperative aspects, called the coopetition interaction. Moreover, we extend the analysis to a real-world situation in which a government, as a social welfare maximizer, intends to certify and support one operator out of two candidate HSR operators. Our analyses reveal that: (a) the passengers’ heterogeneity (with respect to their perceptions on the operators’ quality of services) is the main driver for pricing competition between the three operators. (b) Under certain conditions, implementing a BPS is not only precluded for the incumbent operators, but also their pricing strategies cannot even guarantee their survival in the market. To address this issue, we suggest the incumbent operators adopt non-pricing strategies. Nevertheless, an incumbent operator may freely ride on the other ones’ non-pricing strategy. (c) Under a short-term (long-term) planning horizon, the government should specifically concentrate on compensating for the HSR operating cost (procurement cost of rolling stock). (d) In contrast to the short run, government expenses and the HSR’s profit exploitation provide a strong foundation for the passengers’ full satisfaction in the long run.",0965-8564,Not found
"Mobility-impaired people's preferences for a specialized paratransit service as BRT's feeder: The role of autonomy, relatedness, and competence",10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.008,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Transportation is a very important element in the well-being of mobility-impaired people. However, people with disabilities often struggle to access transportation services at all, especially if they live in mountain areas. This study is aimed at better understanding the main factors that affect the preferences for a new specialized paratransit service as BRT’s feeder to serve the portion of the trip that mobility-impaired people cannot manage. We hypothesized that in addition to some observable attributes of the transportation services, such as time and travel cost, mobility-impaired people’s preferences for a specialized paratransit service as BRT’s feeder could be better explained by using a hybrid discrete choice model based on the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). We gathered responses through a stated-preference survey (N = 350), in which respondents faced a series of choice situations among three BRT feeder alternatives: bus, cable car and a new specialized service. We also obtained indicator ratings through a basic psychological needs satisfaction scale to identify the latent variables in relation to the SDT. Modeling results supported our hypothesis that the preferences of mobility-impaired people are better explained by considering the three innate psychological needs. We found empirical evidence linking the components of the SDT, i.e. Autonomy, Relatedness, and Competence, with preferences for the specialized transportation service as BRT’s feeder in the study context. The multipliers of values of time savings derived from the model showed that mobility-impaired people place access time four times more important than travel time. We accounted for the heterogeneity in value of travel time savings and found that the greater the autonomy in mobility-impaired people the greater their sensitivity to the specialized transportation service’s fare. We concluded that Autonomy, Relatedness, and Competence play an important role in the preferences of mobility-impaired people. Autonomy is a determining factor in perception of alternative fares. Competence motivates mobility-impaired people to use the specialized paratransit service as BRT’s feeder, while Relatedness motivates mobility-impaired people to use the same transportation alternatives used by others.",0965-8564,Not found
Your mileage may vary: Have road-fuel demand elasticities changed over time in middle-income countries?,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.024,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"This paper determines whether road-fuel (gasoline plus diesel) income and price elasticities have changed over time in middle-income countries. To do so, the paper considers a balanced panel of 26 countries that spans 1990–2019. Also, the paper employs two methods that fully allow for cross-sectional heterogeneity, but vary to the extent that they allow for temporal heterogeneity: rolling window, mean group regressions and mean observation OLS, which estimates coefficients for each cross-section and each time period. While the elasticities demonstrate some temporal heterogeneity, such variances are less pronounced than the corresponding country-level heterogeneity. At any point in time, for middle-income countries, the average road-fuel income elasticity is between 1 and 0.8, and the average road-fuel price elasticity is very near −0.2. Lastly, we find no strong evidence that road-fuel demand has become saturated or that efficiency improvements have made consumers less price sensitive in middle-income countries.",0965-8564,Not found
Getting the prices right: Drivers' cruising choices in a serious parking game,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.018,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Scarcity of on-street parking in city centers is a known factor motivating drivers to drive slowly (“to cruise”) while searching for an available parking place and is associated with negative externalities e.g. congestion, accidents, fuel waste, and air pollution. Finding the correct prices is suggested to bring cruising to a sustainable level. Current research methods based on surveys and simulations fail to provide a complete understanding of drivers’ cruising preferences and their behavioral response to price changes. We used the PARKGAME serious game, which provides a real-world abstraction of the dynamic cruising experience. Eighty-three players participated in an experiment under two pricing scenarios. Pricing was spatially designed as “price rings” decreasing when receding from the desired destination point. We analyzed search time, parking distance, parking location choice, and spatial searching patterns. We show that such a pricing policy may substantially reduce the cruising problem, motivating drivers to park earlier—further away from the destination or in the lot, especially when occupancy levels are extremely high. We further discuss the policy implications of these findings.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact and analysis of rider comfort in shared modes during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.019,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Travel behavior has dramatically shifted during the COVID-19 pandemic as social distancing measures and stay-at-home orders are encouraged to prevent the spread of infection. Shared mobility,which includes transit, ride-hailing, and shared ride-hailing, typically involves contact with strangers and is now viewed as a potential risk. To understand current trends and predict potential modal shifts in a post-COVID-19 world, this research designed, developed, and deployed a short online survey about comfort with and usage of shared transportation. The surveywas distributed through multiple recruitment methods to adults in the Atlanta metro area. Data collected from the survey (n = 787) revealed preferences related to ride-sharing environments and safety procedures, frequency of travel on different modes before and during the pandemic,andlevel of comfort related to the usage of different modes. Despite reopening the economy in Georgia, this research found that the actual usage of private ride-hailing and transit has dramatically decreased. In addition to the usage, the indicated comfort level with usage of shared mobility has decreased since the pandemic. Looking to the future, regression models and data analysis indicated that although there would be an increase in comfort for all shared modes when a vaccine is available, it does not return to the pre-pandemic levels.",0965-8564,Not found
"Will leisure trips be more affected than work trips by autonomous technology? Modelling self-driving public transport and cars in Stockholm, Sweden",10.1016/j.tra.2022.08.023,165,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Self-driving technology may lead to a paradigm shift for the transport industry with shared cars available to every-one. However, this vision has increasingly been challenged as too optimistic and unsubstantiated. In this study we explore societal impacts of using this technology for both cars and public transport and investigate differences depending on geography and trip purpose. Four scenarios were designed through workshops with 130 transport experts, modelled using a conventional four-step model for Stockholm, Sweden and evaluated in terms of changes to mode choice, number of trips and person kilometres. We find larger increases for non-commuting trips, i.e. service and leisure trips, than for commuting trips, questioning the view of the ‘productive work trip’ as self-driving technology’s main impact on society. As these trips are primarily made outside of rush hours, this may lead to a changed transport system. Geographic differences are substantial and heavily dependent on the cost model for car alternatives, even indicating a reduction in car travel in rural areas if private ownership would be replaced by shared cars. Furthermore, walking and cycling levels decreased in all scenarios while enhancing public transport using self-driving technology had a limited impact on ridership. These results show that the impacts of self-driving technology may have varied societal impacts even within a region and may lead to increased car travel, especially off-peak. These conclusions stress the need for policies that are sensitive to both geography and time.",0965-8564,Not found
Effect of dockless bike-sharing scheme on the demand for London Cycle Hire at the disaggregate level using a deep learning approach,10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.013,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"To evaluate the dynamic effects of the dockless bike-sharing scheme on the demand of the London Cycle Hire (LCH) scheme at the station level, a novel bicycle demand prediction model is proposed using the deep learning approach, based on the transaction records at 645 docking stations of LCH in the period between July 2017 and March 2018. First, an intervention response module (IRM) is established to model the time-series trends of bicycle demands at individual LCH docking stations, with and without the dockless bike-sharing scheme. Then, the Graph Neural Networks (GNN) predictors are adopted to predict the demand for LCH, incorporating the learned effects from IRM. Results indicate that the proposed bicycle demand prediction model can achieve promising prediction performances, with higher R-squared (R2), lower Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) and lower Mean Absolute Errors (MAE), compared to conventional prediction models. More importantly, the proposed model can recognize the dynamic effects of the dockless bike-sharing scheme on the demand for LCH. For instance, there are possible spillover effects for the influence area of dockless bike-sharing scheme, especially for the neighboring areas that have well-integrated bicycle facilities (e.g., cycle lanes). In addition, the effect of dockless bike sharing on the demand for LCH can magnify over time. Moreover, influences on the demands on weekends are more remarkable than that on weekdays. Findings should improve the understanding on the interdependency between the demands of dockless and docked bike-sharing systems. This should shed light to the optimal management strategy for the docked bike-sharing system that can maximize the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.",0965-8564,Not found
Planning of integrated mobility-on-demand and urban transit networks,10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.001,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"We envision a multimodal transportation system where Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) service is used to serve the first mile and last mile of transit trips. For this purpose, the current research formulates an optimization model for designing an integrated MoD and urban transit system. The proposed model is a mixed-integer non-linear programming model that captures the strategic behavior of passengers in a multimodal network through a passenger assignment model. It determines which transit routes to operate, the frequency of the operating routes, the fleet size of vehicles required in each transportation analysis zone to serve the demand, and the passenger flow on both road and transit networks. A Benders decomposition approach with several enhancements is proposed to solve the given optimization program. Computational experiments are presented for the Sioux Falls multimodal network. The results show a significant improvement in the congestion in the city center with the introduction and optimization of an integrated transportation system. The proposed design allocates more vehicles to the outskirt zones in the network (to serve the first mile and last mile of transit trips) and more frequency to the transit routes in the city center. The integrated system significantly improves the share of transit passengers and their level of service in comparison to the base optimized transit system. The sensitivity analysis of the bus and vehicle fleet shows that increasing the number of buses has more impact on improving the level of service of passengers compared to increasing the number of MoD vehicles. The article also offers managerial insights on deploying such multimodal service.",0965-8564,Not found
Choice-driven service network design for an integrated fixed line and demand responsive mobility system,10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.016,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Sparsely populated areas tend to be poorly served by Fixed Line and Schedule (FLS) public transport systems as the operation of a regular bus line is not economically viable for such areas.

In this paper, a mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) is proposed to design an integrated FLS and DRT network for a transport operator. Passengers behavior is implicitly incorporated in our proposed approach via a discrete choice model. In addition, a tailored Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) coupled with tabu search and simulated annealing are introduced. We test our algorithm on real instances from a public transport operator in the Netherlands. The proposed algorithm can solve the problem up to 170 times faster than the MILP within 4% to 10% gap.

Factors influencing road safety compliance among food delivery riders: An extension of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model,10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.002,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"On-demand food delivery involves transport services based on gig-economy models. Food delivery services rely on motorcycles in many jurisdictions, resulting in safety risks. Motorcycles are generally-two-wheeled and therefore inherently unstable. They also lack rider restraint or roll cage to minimise the consequences of a collision. Given the risks of motorcycle food delivery, there is a need to understand how job design may influence safety behaviour on the roads and regulate this economic activity to minimise potential harmful health consequences on the riders. This study investigated the impact of job demands and resources on food delivery riders' compliance with road safety regulations. The job demands-resources (JD–R) model was used as the theoretical framework for this research. Data were collected using a cross-sectional design involving 550 motorcycle delivery riders in two megacities in Vietnam. A structural equation analysis indicated that job demands (e.g., time pressure, work/life imbalance, working environment) and job resources (e.g., social support, feedback) influence, directly and indirectly, job strain, risk-taking attitude, and road safety compliance.

Carrying out factor analysis, hypothesis, and path test, the main findings are as follows: Government’s demands are divided into the demand of satisfying public activities, self-interest, responsibility, and relieving financial pressure; External environmental factors are divided into social conditions, department mechanism, and project information; The demand for responsibility plays a restraining role, while the other types of demand are opposite, and these demands play an intermediary role in the impact path of external environment on excessive behavior; Among the environmental factors, only the lack of project information has a direct influence on the government excessive behavior; In the feasibility subsidy project, the risk of excessive behavior is high, especially for transportation projects with certain toll nature.

The determinants of commute mode usage frequency of post-secondary students in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area,10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.010,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"An important aspect of post-secondary student travel behaviour is their commute mode usage frequencies. How frequently students use different transportation modes for their daily travel directly characterizes their habits, routines, and predispositions, which can ultimately affect long-term social welfare of the region, congestion of the transportation network, and fuel consumption. Thus, obtaining an in-depth and unbiased understanding of the various factors influencing this travel behavior is key to the sustainable transportation development of a region. Existing studies on this topic are not comprehensive enough in terms of the types of commute modes analyzed and most of them relied on relatively small samples for their investigation. This paper attempts to address the gap by modelling the influence of personal and household socio-demographic attributes, the built environment, commute characteristics, and personal attitudes of the students on the monthly usage frequency of five different types of commute modes (auto, transit, ride-hailing, bicycle, and walk). It uses data from a large-scale student travel survey conducted among 10 post-secondary institutions in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. The study makes use of a sophisticated modelling approach, consisting of a multiple indicators multiple causes model and a zero-inflated ordered probit model to analyze the factors affecting the decision to use and the usage frequency of the exhaustive set of commute modes. The findings emphasize the importance of commute distance, available resources (in terms of mobility tools, living situation, household vehicles, and income), and built environment attributes in the usage frequency of different commute modes. Marginal effects are used to inform actionable policy recommendations for both the institutions and the regional municipalities. The recommendations include offering discounted and promotional transit passes to encourage students to use public transit frequently, increasing the capacity of student housing and enhancing the sidewalk and bicycle infrastructure within 3–5 km of the campus locations, and increasing the transit accessibility of the institutions by establishing subway stops in proximity to the campuses. These recommendations, when implemented, will help to adequately meet the travel needs of the students while also improving their overall campus life experience.",0965-8564,Not found
"Equilibrium analysis of trip demand for autonomous taxi services in Nagoya, Japan",10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.009,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"In recent years, the implementation of autonomous vehicles has been widely discussed worldwide. In particular, urban transportation demand is expected to change significantly when autonomous taxis (ATs) are introduced. Thus, planners must anticipate changes in traffic conditions and the number of users of other transport modes. Therefore, changes in travel behavior and traffic conditions must be quantified with respect to comprehensive changes in the service level of ATs, including changes in fares and the possibility of delays. However, previous studies have not sufficiently considered factors such as the intention to use ATs, the interrelationship between mode choice and traffic congestion, and the impact of ATs on public transit. Therefore, they are not applicable to city-level transportation demand forecasts. The purpose of this study was to propose an easily implementable method for forecasting urban transportation demand when AT services are adopted, which overcomes such problems. In this study, we developed a combined modal split-assignment model and analyzed the effects of various AT service implementation scenarios in Nagoya, Japan. The results showed that the number of trips using taxis will increase by a factor of 11 when AT services are implemented. Additionally, the usage of other modes is expected to decrease by 4%–5%, except for rail usage with a decrease of 1.5%.",0965-8564,Not found
Understanding the route choice behaviour of metro-bikeshare users,10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.006,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Understanding the determinants of the route choice behaviour on a multi-modal transit network of metro and shared bike is important to improve personalized multimodal travel services. This paper attempts to analyse the route choice behaviour of metro-bikeshare users considering passengers’ socio-economic attributes and perceived congestion which is approximated by load status. An abstract integrated metro-bikeshare network (IMBN) is built with virtual nodes by aggregating shared bike stations within the walkable distance and abstract routes by aggregating optional paths for each OD pair. Using the metro- and shared bike smart- card data from Nanjing, China, the route sets of metro-bikeshare users were extracted from the IMBN. A multinomial Logit model (MNL) was then applied to investigate the determinants of route choice behaviour for two types of users, namely “return-enter” and “exit-lease”, respectively. The results show that the models with the load status attributes have a better performance than the models without these attributes. We found the sensitivity of “exit-lease” users to the train crowding is significantly greater than that of the “return-enter” users. “Return-enter” users have a higher perception of out-of-vehicle travel time (OVTT) than that of in-vehicle travel time (IVT), while the “exit-lease” users have the opposite perception. Besides, the change rate of shared bike inventory, departure time and whether he or she is a regular user also have a significant impact on route choice behaviour. The findings can help policymakers and system operators to improve the services and the efficiency of the multimodal transportation system.",0965-8564,Not found
Joint investment on resilience of cross-country transport infrastructure,10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.004,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Unlike the domestic transport infrastructure, the cross-country ones are subject to more diverse and unconventional disruption risks due to the unstable geopolitical conditions, terrorist attacks, and complex landscape and extreme weather events, thus calling for resilience-related investments from different countries. However, such resilience investment made by one country to deal with such unconventional disruption risk is very hard to be verified by other countries (i.e., non-verifiability). This paper establishes an integrated economic model to analytically examine countries’ joint resilience investments on the cross-country transport infrastructure in presence of non-verifiability. Specifically, there is one “investing country” who constructed the infrastructure which is also used by a “host country”. Our analytical results suggest that the first-best investment and market outcomes for the global welfare maximization can be achieved if the resilience investment is verifiable. The non-verifiability is, however, found to cause a downward distortion in the resilience investment and an upward distortion in transport price when the probability of the disruption is higher such that the resilience investment only partially covers the potential loss. On the contrary, when the probability of disruption is low so that the resilience investment can lead to the full loss coverage, the first-best outcomes can still be achieved without any distortion. Our analytical model is also extended to account for the intermodal competition. Although our main conclusions still qualitatively hold, the intermodal competition is found to have uncertain effects on the market outcomes, depending on the interaction between the resilience investment cost and the degree of the intermodal competition.",0965-8564,Not found
Intention to perform eco-driving and acceptance of eco-driving system,10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.017,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Eco-driving is one strategy for reducing transportation sector fuel usage and greenhouse gas emissions. With the advancement of connected-vehicle technology, the dynamic eco-driving concept can utilize real-time vehicle-specific information to optimize vehicle speed, thereby further reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The objective of this research was to determine the elements that influence drivers' intentions to practice eco-driving and their acceptance of eco-driving technology. A theoretical model of technology acceptance for both internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and electric vehicle (EV) drivers was built using a mix of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Goal Framing. Drivers’ acceptance of eco-driving system was hypothesized to be based on their intention to perform eco-driving. The model's validity was verified using a structural equation modeling analysis of data from a survey with 340 replies from ICEV drivers and 315 responses from EV drivers. The findings corroborated the original hypotheses in TAM and TPB, and drivers' intention to practice eco-driving had an indirect effect on their intention to utilize the system via the construct of perceived ease of use. In comparison to ICEV drivers, EV drivers possessed a greater understanding of eco-driving. The four goal framing structures each played a different role in the ICEV and EV models. In the ICEV model, the altruistic goal contributed positively to the social norm construct. By contrast, the social norm was positively influenced by the biospheric and the egoistic goals, and negatively influenced by the hedonic goal in the EV model. This study's framework and results provide theoretical and practical guidelines for researchers, manufacturers, and policy-makers to understand drivers' motivation to perform eco-driving and increase drivers' acceptance of the eco-driving system.",0965-8564,Not found

Safety and security co-analysis in transport systems: Current state and regulatory development,10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.005,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Transportation is sensitive to risk. Given the fast development of digitalisation and automation of transport systems in the past decade, new types of security risks (e.g. cyberattacks) emerge within the context of transport safety research. To enable the integrated analysis of emerging security and classical safety-related risks in a holistic manner, safety and security co-analysis (SSCA) is highly demanded for accident prevention. SSCA in transport systems will benefit the risk analysis of complex cyber physical transport systems facing challenges from both hazards and threats. However, the nature of hazard and threat-based risks is fundamentally different, which leads to the various difficulties of analysing them on the same plane. They include the use of different risk parameters, the uncertainty levels of the risk input and the methodologies of risk inference. To address such concerns, this study firstly reviews the literature on SSCA and compares the employed methodologies and their applications within the context of transport systems. Taking into account the advantages of both security-driven and safety-oriented methods, a conceptual framework is proposed to imply the insights on SSCA for transportation through both top-down and bottom-up perspectives, followed by a quantitative illustrative case study. Then, the regulatory development and evolution of SSCA in transport in practice is analysed across different transport modes, which configures initiatives’ interrelations for a cross-fertilisation purpose. As a result, the findings reveal new research directions for the safety of digitalised and/or autonomous transport vehicles and aid in the formation of future transport safety study agendas.",0965-8564,Not found
How do pandemics affect intercity air travel? Implications for traffic and environment,10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.008,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This paper investigates how a pandemic affects the distribution of traffic between public and private transport and the emissions from the transport sector. By assuming that there exists higher health risk of traveling in public transport than in private transport and using air transport and private cars as examples, we find the following results. First, the effects of a pandemic on the traffic volumes of airline services and private cars depend crucially on, for instance, the willingness-to-pay of travelers, the degree of substitution between transport modes, the demand-side network effect (via schedule delays), and the supply-side network effect (via the economies of traffic density). In particular, heterogeneous effects of the pandemic on the traffic volumes and flight frequencies of different airline services are found. Second, the total transport-related CO2 emissions decrease after the pandemic if the CO2 emissions per air traveler (or per flight) are sufficiently high, or the degree of substitution between airline services and private cars is sufficiently low. Third, numerical examples on the change in price of car travel and the introduction of high-speed rail show consistent insights. Finally, several policy implications are discussed.",0965-8564,Not found
Modeling the effect of real-time crowding information (RTCI) on passenger distribution in trains,10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.011,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Overcrowding has become a big challenge for public transport systems, affecting passengers’ travel experience. At the same time, service supply is often underutilized due to large variations in crowding across services, vehicle trips on the same service and different compartments of the same vehicle. Real-time operational measures, such as information provision, can potentially reduce on-board crowding unevenness and its negative effects. In this study, we extend a dynamic public transport simulation model to provide passengers with predictive real-time crowding information (RTCI) concerning individual train cars. Passengers utilize this information when choosing a specific train car to board. It is demonstrated through a case study for the Stockholm metro network area that in the presence of car-specific crowding information, passengers alter their car boarding choices to avoid on-board crowding, leading to a more even passenger distribution inside trains. We find that passengers’ travel experience improves with the provisioning of RTCI, which is a result of the lower on-board crowding unevenness. Moreover, this improvement increases with increased demand levels but only up to a certain point beyond which passengers do not gain from switching train cars.",0965-8564,Not found
"Preferences for first and last mile shared mobility between stops and activity locations: A case study of local public transport users in Utrecht, the Netherlands",10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.008,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Shared transport modes can potentially contribute to first and last mile connections of public transport (PT) trips but this remains quite underexplored in the literature. Our study explores the user preferences for shared modes as first and last mile option to connect activity locations. We have focussed on local public transport in the Utrecht province, The Netherlands, which includes bus and tram lines. Its diversity in land use and PT network density, the overall high bicycle usage, as well as the increased proliferation of shared mobility concepts yield promising information which can be a harbinger for future PT integration worldwide. For both the urban and suburban areas of the province, we have designed and conducted a stated choice experiment. Respondents were able to choose from shared bicycles, e-bikes, e-scooters, and e-mopeds to reach their urban destination from a PT stop. For suburban destinations, we also included light-electric vehicles (LEVs), e-cars, and demand-responsive taxi services. Such a complete list of possibilities to travel by shared modes allows comparing the different options and producing trade-offs not available yet in the literature. A sample of 499 respondents (285 urban and 214 suburban PT travellers) considered their first and last mile mode choice of a recent PT trip in light of the new options. Results show that shared (electric-)bicycles and e-scooters are generally preferred over other shared mobility options. The latter specifically targets younger people (<26 years) and travellers towards suburban destinations. Still, a majority of PT users prefers not to use shared modes in the first and last mile. We found that age, current cycling behaviour and weekday/weekend travelling are the most important factors which determine these preferences. We argue that shared bicycles and e-bikes are the most capable modes in providing benefits to PT travellers in this context and, given the relatively low travel time sensitivity, can best be distributed around the most important PT stops.",0965-8564,Not found
Joint modeling of arrivals and parking durations for freight loading zones: Potential applications to improving urban logistics,10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.003,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This paper analyzes truck parking patterns in urban freight loading zones by jointly modeling the vehicle arrival rates and the parking durations. Three models were explored: 1) Count data (Negative Binomial) for vehicle arrivals, 2) Survival (Weibull) model for parking duration and 3) A joint model for arrivals and duration. The count data model estimates the parking demand i.e., the rate of truck arrival, while the survival model estimates the probability that a truck is parked for one more minute. The joint model is compared with separate models for predictability and performance. The dataset used in this research is obtained using a mobile phone parking application, at eight loading zones in the city Vic, Spain over an 18-month period from July 2018 to December 2019, comprised of vehicle parking durations, date, time of arrival and departure, professional activity, and vehicle type (weight). The parking activity data are complemented with built in environment variables of the loading zones, such as the number of establishments in a certain radius, the average walking distance to establishments, the presence of pedestrian pavement, the number of traffic lanes, among others. The joint model outperforms the models estimating the arrival rates and durations separately in goodness of fit and predictability. The model results showed that truck arrival rates vary significantly across days of the week, months, and arrival times. The parking durations are highly dependent on professional activity, vehicle type, and size. Tuesdays and Wednesdays have higher arrival rates compared to other days of a week (except Sundays). Among activities, the transport and parcels require longer parking durations. Among the vehicle types, trucks with gross weight larger than 3.5 tons park longer. This paper concludes by explaining the potential of these modeling approaches in improving urban freight operations, evaluation of various policy implications, limitations, and future research.",0965-8564,Not found
Accessibility of high-speed rail (HSR) stations and HSR–air competition: Evidence from China,10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.015,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Most high-speed rail (HSR) stations in China were built in the urban periphery. This study investigates whether peripheral HSR stations increase the demand for air transportation, a mode of transportation that competes with HSR. We establish a series of novel city-pair level indicators of accessibility of HSR stations using geographical information system (GIS) technology, and adopt an extended difference-in-differences analysis to comprehensively elucidate the effect of HSR station accessibility on parallel air transportation. Based on the data of 581 Chinese air routes from 2003 to 2019, we find that less accessible HSR stations increase passenger traffic and flights on parallel air routes, but do not affect cargo traffic on parallel air routes. Specifically, travel time to/from HSR stations, rather than the physical location of HSR stations, affects the intermodal substitution between HSR and air. Our study indicates that for 1 % decline in the public transport travel time-based station accessibility for a given HSR route, the annual number of passengers on the parallel air route will increase by 809. This effect, which would increase the demand for airline services in the long run, is larger for routes shorter than 1,500 km, routes with airports that serve as bases for low-cost air carriers, and routes connecting hub cities, tourism cities, or cities with advanced economic conditions. Our findings offer new insights into HSR station accessibility and provide policy implications regarding the integration of intra-city public transportation systems with HSR stations.",0965-8564,Not found
"Does better accessibility help to reduce social exclusion? Evidence from the city of São Paulo, Brazil",10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.005,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Most transport equity and transport-related social exclusion (TRSE) studies assume that increasing accessibility levels lead to increased activity participation and, therefore, a reduction in social exclusion. Although this assumption makes sense from a theoretical point of view, this causal relationship has not yet been validated in practice. Previous studies investigating the accessibility-participation relationship were inconclusive, indicating that increasing accessibility has a limited impact on activity participation levels, if any. Moreover, the existing empirical evidence in the literature in the Global South context is scarce, is merely correlational and fails to infer causality between both variables. The contributions of the paper are threefold. First, (a) to provide a conceptual model of the causal relationship between accessibility, activity participation and risk of transport-related social exclusion (TRSE); second, (b) to summarise the available empirical evidence about the accessibility-activity participation relationship through a systematic literature review; and third, (c) to provide evidence of the causal relationship between accessibility and activity participation levels in a Global South context. Three Poisson regression models associated with an instrumental variable identification strategy were used to assess the causal effect between accessibility and participation in total, mandatory and discretionary activities in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The three models showed a highly significant, strong correlation between an individual’s accessibility level and their actual participation in total, mandatory and discretionary activities. Models that ignore the possible endogeneity present in the relationship between accessibility and activity participation may underestimate the effect of accessibility. Based on our results, we argue that low accessibility levels may severely restrict individuals’ life chances and add evidence that accessibility has to be an important instrument to support transport policies' decision-making.",0965-8564,Not found
Travel behavior on vacation: transport mode choice of tourists at destinations,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.018,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Tourist travel contributes greatly to transport problems in highly attractive tourist areas. Despite that, local travel behavior of visitors at the destination has hardly been investigated so far. To fill this gap, we used data from a bespoke travel-activity survey conducted in the Austrian Alps to develop models of transport mode choice of tourists during their vacation stays at the resorts. The outcomes reveal significant effects of, inter alia, travel time, travel cost, travel party composition, trip purpose, respondent’s level of fitness, their knowledge about long-distance travel to the destination and mobility options at the destination, and selected weather elements. Tourists are found to be very inelastic to changes in travel cost, whilst more responsive to changes in travel time. The paper delivers unique evidence that can advance transport policy design and thus contribute to more sustainable travel at tourist destinations.",0965-8564,Not found

Evidence from public transport travellers in Xi'an, China",10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.003,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"The spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has decreased the willingness to choose public transport where travellers are more likely to be infected due to intensive passenger flow, in which case it is hard to attract passenger volume if the subjective well-being of travellers is not improved. However, the traditional measurement of travel evaluation may be not applicable to the context of the pandemic and it is necessary to analyse the changes in the internal mechanisms of travel well-being to avoid the loss of passengers. Based on structural equation modelling, this paper explored the internal relationship between the constructs of travel well-being and emphasised the significance of taking psychological factors into consideration in the post COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that travel satisfaction with the anti-pandemic related service quality of public transport is related to overall travel well-being, which can be used as a key part of well-being measurement scale design in the future. The results also indicate that, due to negative mood on the affective level induced by COVID-19, travel satisfaction on the cognitive level is not directly but indirectly related to travel choice behaviour through overall travel well-being. Compared to travel satisfaction, travel well-being is more extensive and covers travel satisfaction to some extent. Therefore, instead of studying travel satisfaction simply, taking travel well-being as the dependent variable to identify shortages existing in public transport will provide a more accurate perspective for policymakers in the post COVID-19 pandemic.",0965-8564,Not found
Predicting Mobility as a Service (MaaS) use for different trip categories: An artificial neural network analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.014,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Mobility as a Service (MaaS) has gained popularity as a means of sustainable urban transport which makes the understanding of MaaS use critical for its design and promotion. Studies have contributed to the growing understanding of MaaS, its design features, and consumers’ willingness to pay for MaaS in general, without recourse to the differences in traveling for work, social and general purposes. This paper develops and tests models to predict MaaS use by applying artificial neural network analysis, following the cross industry standard process and data mining framework. It also estimates separate models for social, general, and work trips, using 33 input variables reflecting network externality, transaction cost, behaviour, institutional, environmental concern, personal travel, and socio-economic factors. Data are collected from a survey of 331 Australians. The study reveals different sets of socio-economic factors, the impact of Covid-19, and personal travel factors as key predictors of MaaS use for general, social, and work trips with an average prediction accuracy of 68%, 68%, and 75% respectively. The findings can be used to inform strategies and policies on how to attract a user base with respect to socio-economic and personal travel factors for promoting MaaS use.",0965-8564,Not found
Public transport service quality: Policy prioritization strategy in the importance-performance analysis and the three-factor theory frameworks,10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.006,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Service quality is a determinant of increasing public transport rider satisfaction. However, understanding of service quality and satisfaction relations has been limited. This study seeks an appropriate method to demonstrate the nature of service quality-satisfaction relations. Thereby, research results can be methodologically, theoretically, and empirically defensible. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) and the three-factor theory, the most widely preferred for public transport service quality prioritization based on the importance of service factors to rider satisfaction, will be utilized. The study takes transit service in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, to demonstrate that the three-factor theory, which has been limitedly utilized despite being more advantageous and robust, is superior to the IPA. Although the extent to which the service quality factors affect satisfaction varied across rider segments, the types of service quality factors were found consistent. For example, captive riders considered all service factors as performance. Non-captive riders considered the environment factor as excitement. No basic factor was found across rider groups. This study contributes to the limited understanding of the non-linear and asymmetric relations between service quality and satisfaction of various rider groups, which is rarely found in transit service quality literature. Furthermore, it introduced a case study of Vietnamese urban transit services for the first time. It suggests that enhancing passenger information, rider care, and comfort are recommended as the most practical and economical measures in the short run. However, the city government should improve availability and accessibility to promote public transport ridership in the long run.",0965-8564,Not found
Transport policies in polycentric cities,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.017,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This paper studies how transit lines should be developed in polycentric cities. In several growing metropolitan areas, local authorities have to decide whether to rely on existing radial lines connecting suburban areas to the city-center, or to develop new circular lines directly connecting suburban areas. An efficient transit system aims at reducing external costs of transport (congestion and pollution) by attracting private car users. We study the effect of two types of policies on the modal split. First, we compare the effect of three administration regimes (public, semi-public and private) on the external costs of transport. Second, we consider the opening of a new transit line directly linking the suburbs. We find that it reduces aggregate user cost but is not Pareto-improving unless crowding is high on existing transit lines. Our analysis is complemented by a numerical illustration based on an open source Fortran program. This tool needs a relatively small set of data and can be used by policy makers wishing to investigate the pricing reforms or the possibility of opening a new transit line for a specific case study.",0965-8564,Not found
What happens when post-secondary programmes go virtual for COVID-19? Effects of forced telecommuting on travel demand of post-secondary students during the pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2022.10.004,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads globally, disrupting every aspect of everyday activities. Countermeasures during the pandemic, such as remote working and learning, proliferated tele-activities worldwide during the COVID −19 pandemic. The prevalence of telecommuting could lead to new activity-travel patterns. It is in the interest of transport demand modellers to capture this developing trend of telecommuting using state-of-art travel demand forecasting techniques. This study develops a modelling framework using activity-based and agent-based microsimulation to forecast activity-travel demand considering telecommuting and the pandemic. For empirical application, the modelling framework investigates changes in travel behaviours in post-secondary students when all major post-secondary institutions in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada, decided to go virtual during the pandemic. The empirical investigation reveals that enforced telecommuting and the pandemic caused significant mobility drops and shifts in students' trip starting time patterns. While only considering the influence of telecommuting, the empirical exercise reveals noteworthy dynamics between telecommuting and the overall travel demand. Telecommuting could simultaneously reduce the need to commute but also induce discretionary travel. When telecommuting is enforced, students' overall trip rates drop by 14.2%, despite increasing trip rates for all discretionary activities except shopping/market. Moreover, the study demonstrates that it is beneficial to model at-home productive and maintenance episodes when telecommuting is prominent.",0965-8564,Not found

It uses two distinct population-specific benchmarks to determine the relative position of the subgroup: a theoretical worst-case and a theoretical best-case situation. An application of the index to transport is also presented, using 49 of the largest US metropolitan regions as case studies. Job accessibility by public transport is assessed for two population subgroups especially likely to benefit from public transport: adults without a car and adults living in poverty. It is found that the car-less population is comparatively better served by public transport than the poor population. Additionally, regions with a higher TPI score for car-less populations also tend to have public transport systems that better serve their population living in poverty. These results highlight that the proposed index allows for easy comparison across regions, despite large differences in the scale of the variable of interest (accessibility by public transport), the total population, and the size of the target groups (car-less or adults in poverty).",0965-8564,Not found

This development of logistics facilities in high-demand areas, which are essentially urban, dense and mixed-use, we term ‘proximity logistics’. It is the focus of this article. Proximity logistics entails extending and refining networks of logistics facilities towards urban cores and allows them to counteract some of the undesirable effects that their historic tendency to outward migration (or logistics sprawl) potentially brings about. The phenomenon is established around the world, albeit to different extents. In this article, we discuss the trends supporting proximity logistics’ development and present a typology of facilities it could entail, followed by case studies of five cities: New York (United States); Paris (France); Seoul (South Korea); Shanghai (China); and Tokyo (Japan).

Air traffic flow management under emission policies: Analyzing the impact of sustainable aviation fuel and different carbon prices,10.1016/j.tra.2022.09.013,166,2022-12-01,2022,12,"As part of the global efforts to make aviation activities more environmentally friendly, the worldwide goal is to achieve a 50% reduction in the 2005 emissions by 2050. In this context, aviation emissions represent a critical challenge to aviation activities, especially with the increasing travel demand up to the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, starting in 2020. One of the potential drivers that would help the aviation industry reduce its emissions is the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In this study, we analyzed the impact of SAF from an air traffic flow management (ATFM) perspective, considering delay and re-routing costs. We developed an optimization model that considers, in addition to the traditional ATFM costs, fuel costs and carbon dioxide emissions. We investigated the impact of accounting for these two new aspects, that is, fuel costs and emissions, on ATFM performance, and we compared SAF with conventional fuel. The analysis of a real case study revealed that, in addition to delay and re-routing costs, fuel cost should be included in the ATFM model so that the resulting solution becomes economically and environmentally realistic for airlines. The increase in the fuel cost and network delays when using SAF requires setting an appropriate carbon price under an emission policy, such as the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international flights policy, to make SAF more attractive.

However, their mandatory nature raises concerns about their public acceptability and intention of compliance. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing users’ acceptability and intended behavioral reaction to the two major types of ETW standardization policy schemes in the Mainland, China. Based on the Value-Belief-Norm Theory combined with policy-specific perceptions, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) was proposed to analyze the determinants of users’ acceptability under each policy scheme. Furthermore, a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model was applied in each scheme to identify key factors affecting users' decisions on their compliance behaviors. To achieve these objectives, a sample of 830 responses was collected from China using a questionnaire survey. The results of the SEM showed an identical psychological mechanism of acceptability in the two schemes. In the mechanism, factors regarding policy-specific perceptions were strong direct determinants of policy acceptability, and perceived policy effectiveness was affected by general environmental beliefs. The MNL model’s estimation revealed similar findings for the two schemes: higher levels of acceptability and household income increase users’ propensity to engage in compliance behaviors, whereas higher levels of education and frequent use of ETWs reduce it. However, there exists one significant difference between the two schemes as well. The positive effect of the acceptability on intended compliance behaviors in the high and low-income groups would only be equal in a scheme that provides a subsidy. The findings can help improve public acceptability and social compliance, resulting in greater policy effectiveness.",0965-8564,Not found

Willingness to pay for COVID-19 mitigation measures in public transport and paratransit in low-income countries,10.1016/j.tra.2022.103561,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"In order to combat the spread of COVID-19, various measures were taken in most countries to make public transit and paratransit safer. These additional measures, which include restrictions on number of passengers, provision of hand sanitisers and face coverings, and more frequent cleaning, add to the costs of operations or reduce profitability. The resulting financial pressure on the transport operators raises an important question on who pays for these additional measures. In most countries, this has been covered by one-time government bailouts to operators or strategies to increase fare, the latter of which directly affects the users. However, even without these interventions, there could be a demand and as such willingness to pay (WTP) for some of these intervention measures from the consumers concerned about safety. Knowing such WTP will not only help operators set their fare, but also help the governments decide the appropriate bailout needed. This paper addresses the issue by estimating the user’s willingness to pay for selected COVID-19 mitigation measures in public transport and paratransit (motorcycle taxis) using survey data collected from two cities in low-income countries as case studies – Kampala, Uganda and Dhaka, Bangladesh. For public transport, these measures are - (1) social distancing (passenger loading at half capacity), and (2) mandatory hand sanitisation and increased cleaning of surfaces, while for paratransit, they are - (1) provision of a transparent shield between the rider and the passenger, and (2) provision of cleaned helmets at the start of each trip. The study analyses stated preference data using the utility maximisation framework and finds that the implementation or provision of COVID-19 mitigation measures improves the attractiveness of the associated public transport or paratransit alternatives, and transport users make trade-offs between safety and cost when making travel decisions. We find positive willingness to pay for all four mitigation measures, suggesting potential existence of a market for these measures. We also find that the typical mode choice factors such as costs, travel time and convenience became less important during the pandemic and the safety measures became more important considerations.",0965-8564,Not found
Anger between bus drivers and passengers or among passengers: Development of a bus passenger anger scale (BPAS) and a bus driver anger scale (BDAS),10.1016/j.tra.2022.103563,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"In China, numerous fatal accidents have occurred due to anger caused by conflicts between the driver and passengers or among passengers on buses. Nonetheless, based on existing knowledge, there is no tool available to measure the anger experience of passengers and drivers. The existing driving anger scale (DAS) can be applied only to assess a driver’s tendency to experience driving anger in driving-related scenarios, such as traffic obstruction, others’ illegal driving and pedestrians illegally crossing, which often happen outside the vehicle. This study developed a bus passenger anger scale (BPAS) and a bus driver anger scale (BDAS) for measuring the anger experience of drivers and passengers in various conflict situations that occur on buses. The results of two independent surveys involving 384 passengers and 414 drivers indicate that the BPAS measures four dimensions of bus passenger anger, including drivers' or passengers' rude behavior, mutual hostility, unintentional behavior, and passengers' violations, and that the BDAS measures four dimensions of driver anger, including passengers' rude behavior, hostility between the driver and passengers, passengers' extreme behavior, and drivers' violations. Through exploratory principal component analysis (PCA) and reliability analysis, two reliable scales that can be used to measure drivers’ or passengers’ experiences of anger were constructed. The BPAS contains 22 items and 4 factors, and the BDAS contains 21 items and 4 factors. Data analysis revealed that, compared to the level of driving anger provoked by stimulators outside the vehicle, which has been extensively studied by previous researchers, the level of bus driver anger caused by passenger-driver conflicts was higher. Furthermore, bus passenger anger was more inclined to be triggered by mutual hostility and other persons’ rude behaviors. Passengers’ extreme behaviors elicited the highest driver anger rating from drivers. Finally, a correlation analysis indicated that older passengers and older drivers were less inclined to become angry when encountering anger-provoking situations.",0965-8564,Not found
How cargo cycle drivers use the urban transport infrastructure,10.1016/j.tra.2022.103562,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Electric cargo cycles are often considered a viable alternative mode for delivering goods in an urban area. However, cities in the U.S. are struggling to regulate cargo cycles, with most authorities applying the same rules used for motorized vehicles or traditional bikes. One reason is the lack of understanding of the relationship between existing regulations and transport infrastructure and cargo cycle parking and driving behaviors. In this study, we analyzed a cargo cycle pilot test in Seattle and collected detailed data on the types of infrastructure used for driving and parking. GPS data were augmented by installing a video camera on the cargo cycle and recording the types of infrastructure used (distinguishing between the travel lane, bicycle lane, and sidewalk), the time spent on each type, and the activity performed. The analysis created a first-of-its-kind, detailed profile of the parking and driving behaviors of a cargo cycle driver. We observed a strong preference for parking (80 percent of the time) and driving (37 percent of the time) on the sidewalk. We also observed that cargo cycle parking was generally short (about 4 min), and the driver parked very close to the delivery address (30 m on average) and made only one delivery. Using a random utility model, we identified the infrastructure design parameters that would incentivize drivers to not use the sidewalk and to drive more on travel and bicycle lanes. The results from this study can be used to better plan for a future in which cargo cycles are used to make deliveries in urban areas.",0965-8564,Not found
Designing government subsidy schemes to promote the electric vehicle industry: A system dynamics model perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.018,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"To ensure green and sustainable development, how to design effective subsidy schemes to promote the electric vehicle (EV) industry has become a critical problem faced by governments. In this paper, using a system dynamics (SD) model that incorporates the dynamic interactions between government, manufacturers, and consumers, we investigate the effects of different subsidy schemes (an acquisition subsidy vs a Research and Development (R&D) subsidy, as well as dynamic vs static subsidies) on the EV industry and environmental protection. Using empirical evidence from China, we verify the proposed model and predict that both an acquisition subsidy and an R&D subsidy can boost EV demand and reduce CO2 emissions. The acquisition subsidy helps to stimulate the sales of EVs more quickly and to a greater extent in the short term, but at great expense; for a given level of government expenditure, the R&D subsidy is more effective in promoting EV penetration and mitigating CO2 emissions. Moreover, the dynamic R&D subsidy scheme outperforms the static one in terms of subsidy efficiency. The study has implications for policy makers designing a subsidy scheme to promote the development of the EV industry.",0965-8564,Not found
"Measuring disparities in air transport access across Europe: An inequality, vulnerability and dependence approach",10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.016,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Air transport networks tend to develop in accordance with underlying economic activity and links. This relationship in Europe has not developed entirely evenly or consistently, however, with some regional population centres having comparatively low levels of access to air transport services and global markets. This study focusses on air transport access inequality across 1,388 regions in Europe using the 20:20 ratio, a commonly used indicator in macroeconomic income inequality studies. For those regions in the bottom 5% in terms of degree centrality (using 2019 baseline data) an in-depth vulnerability, dependence and pandemic impact analysis was performed to determine the regions that may represent strong cases for state intervention to ensure continued access to a base level of essential air services. The stepwise methodological framework developed in this research could be used as a prioritisation tool by industry and policy stakeholders, most notably in the context of scarce public resources, which is a typical characteristic in Europe. The highest levels of inequality, vulnerability, dependence and pandemic impact were found in some Spanish, and Finnish regions.",0965-8564,Not found
Can parallel airline alliances be welfare improving? The case of airline–airport vertical agreement,10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.019,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Parallel airline alliances have negative effects on consumers a priori; however, they can be counteracted if airports may modify the behavior of airlines. In particular, vertical airport–airline agreements allow the airport to influence the competition downstream market, changing the effects of parallel alliances. In this paper, we analyze the effects of parallel alliances in the context of competition between vertical airport–airline pairs competition. We show that under the influence of airports, parallel alliances are welfare improving, and the number of passengers increases, against former studies. These results offer a new brand of analyses to be considered by authorities that evaluate parallel alliances.",0965-8564,Not found
"Investigating day-to-day route choices based on multi-scenario laboratory experiments, Part I: Route-dependent attraction and its modeling",10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.013,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"In the area of urban transportation networks, a growing number of day-to-day (DTD) traffic dynamic theories have been proposed to describe the network flow evolution, and an increasing amount of laboratory experiments have been conducted to observe travelers’ behavior regularities. However, the ‘communication’ between theorists and experimentalists has not been well made. This paper devotes to 1) detecting unanticipated behavior regularities by conducting a series of laboratory experiments, and 2) improving existing DTD dynamics theories by embedding the observed behavior regularities into a route choice model. First, 312 subjects participated in one of the eight decision-making scenarios and make route choices repeatedly in congestible parallel-route networks. Second, three route-switching behavior patterns that cannot be fully explained by the classic route-choice models are observed. Third, to enrich the explanation power of a discrete route-choice model, behavioral assumptions of route-dependent attractions, i.e., route-dependent inertia and preference, are introduced. An analytical DTD dynamic model is accordingly proposed and proven to steadily converge to a unique equilibrium state. Finally, the proposed DTD model could satisfactorily reproduce the observations in various datasets. The research results can help transportation science theorists to make the best use of the laboratory experimentation and to build network equilibrium or DTD dynamic models with both real behavioral basis and neat mathematical properties.",0965-8564,Not found
"The impact of COVID-19 on route-level changes in transit demand an analysis of five transit agencies in Florida, USA",10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.014,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"This study examined the impacts of COVID-19 on changes in route-level transit demand across five transit agencies in the state of Florida. Data for 120 routes from five transit agencies were used to develop two-stage instrumental variable models. Data from January of 2019 to December of 2020 were used in the analysis. Routes that served a greater mix of land-uses experienced a smaller decline in ridership. The impacts of several other land-use variables were, however, not consistent across the five transit agencies. Fare suspension was estimated to have a positive impact on ridership. In contrast, occupancy reduction measures (to promote social distancing within the transit vehicle) had a very strong negative impact on demand. The magnitude of the negative impact of occupancy reduction was larger than the positive impacts of fare suspension. Extending this analysis to a larger set of routes across more agencies would be useful in enhancing the robustness of the findings from our models. Extending our analysis to include data from 2021 and later to capture the recovery phase is also an important direction for future work.",0965-8564,Not found
Exploring attitude-behaviour dynamics during COVID-19: How fear of infection and working from home influence train use and the attitude toward this mode,10.1016/j.tra.2022.103560,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Research on the relationships between travel-related attitudes and travel behaviour has recently been reinvigorated by new theorizing as well as new empirical models. While traditional theories assume a rather static role of attitudes, i.e. acting as stable predispositions that cause behaviours in a unidirectional manner, recent models assume that attitudes and behaviours mutually influence each other over time. This study aims at better understanding attitude-behaviour dynamics by capitalizing on the circumstances presented by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It assesses how the fear of COVID-19 infection and (the attitude towards) working-from-home influence train use as well as train use attitudes. To explore the (within-person) reciprocal relationships between these variables, random-intercept cross-lagged panel models were estimated using a 4-wave longitudinal dataset collected during the COVID-19 pandemic from a large panel of train travellers in the Netherlands. The results indicate that train use and the attitude towards train use reciprocally influence each other. Those with stronger fears of infection in one wave tend to use the train less in a subsequent wave, but higher use of the train in one wave also reduces the fear of infection in the next. We also found that working from home (WFH) and travelling by train operate as substitutes for one another. Moreover, people who work from home frequently become more fearful of infection. All the findings are consistent with cognitive dissonance theory that people develop attitudes that align with their behaviours. The paper concludes with several policy implications related to changing attitudes and promoting train use.",0965-8564,Not found

While electric vehicle (EV) uptake is increasing in many countries, some nations – like Australia – are EV laggards. Here we analyse the stated preferences towards EVs of a representative sample of 500 Australian consumers by estimating a mixed logit model, which will help inform policy-makers in similar markets on how to potentially accelerate uptake. Additionally, the findings of this study are useful to EV manufacturers in exploring the specific vehicle features that are most attractive to consumers, and that are likely to be required to stimulate uptake in car-dependent markets, like Australia, with longer distances between urban areas. The attributes examined in this study include purchase price, driving range, fast charging time, public fast charger availability, financial incentives, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities. As one of the first consumer preference studies to include V2G capabilities, this study also aims to understand how broader potential energy benefits stemming from EV ownership are perceived by consumers, and whether these features could further stimulate uptake. As expected, purchase price, driving range, fast charging time, public fast charger availability and financial incentives in the form of energy bill discounts were found to be significant factors affecting the choice to purchase an EV. Interestingly, the availability of V2G was found to have a significant impact on consumer choice, with consumers’ marginal willingness-to-pay for these features ranging from AUD 2,319 to AUD 5,346, depending on the technical details of its implementation. As identified in other studies, younger consumers were found to be more likely to purchase an EV, and higher levels of EV awareness also have a significant positive impact.",0965-8564,Not found
Gamification in the transport sector: Quasi-experimental evidence from a bicycle navigation app,10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.012,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"This study measures the short- and long-term effects of two gamification campaigns in Germany on individual mobility behavior using data from a bicycle navigation app. The gamification campaign in Hamburg featured individual benefits, while the campaign in Bremen was a community challenge, including a virtual trip to the moon. The temporal and geographical nature of the campaigns allows for a quasi-experimental analysis comparing campaign participants with non-participants (within a city) and individuals from a treated city with a control city. Descriptive analyses suggest that gamification can lead to an increase in new customers. Furthermore, fixed-effects panel regressions show that gamification leads to more recorded trips during campaigns. In addition, gamification also increases the recorded cycling distance, while average speed remains unaffected. In the case of the individually rewarding campaign in Hamburg, there is evidence that cycling distance is also increased in the long term. Overall, there is evidence of effects on the extensive margin (number of users) and intensive margin (behavior per user).",0965-8564,Not found
Commuter preferences for a first-mile/last-mile microtransit service in the United States,10.1016/j.tra.2022.11.009,167,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Transportation system models rely heavily upon value of time (VOT) estimates to predict customer behavior. Accurate VOT estimates are particularly vital for planning new services such as on-demand ride hailing or microtransit because customers’ sensitivity to wait time, walk time, and route detour time affects their likelihood of selecting these modes. If an incorrect VOT is assumed during service planning, then ridership will be depressed because of a mismatch between their preferences and how the system is designed. In this paper, we report on the measurement of VOT for microtransit, a shared first-mile/last-mile mobility service, obtained using stated preference microdata from four U.S. cities. We found a median in-vehicle VOT for microtransit of $18.63 (95% CI: $13.39–$24.46) and an access VOT of $75.38 (95% CI: $59.22–$94.96). The former is practically equal to the VOT we found for respondents’ current modes ($20.24, 95% CI: $13.71–$26.94). We also found that men, younger riders, the highly educated, and transit riders are more likely to be interested in microtransit. Since the disutility of time spent on microtransit is not higher than that of other modes, we believe this new service has the potential to attract riders, and particularly if the system is designed with low waiting and walking times.",0965-8564,Not found

In this paper we use data collected in New South Wales during September 2020 and June 2021, seven and 16 months after the pandemic began, to obtain an understanding of the extent to which the pandemic has impacted on how worthwhile things done in life are for workers. We investigate whether there is a systematic behavioural link with working from home, reduced commuting linked to distance to work, and various socio-economic characteristics.

"Shared mobility services towards Mobility as a Service (MaaS): What, who and when?",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103581,168,2023-02-01,2023,2,"There is a growing popularity for shared mobility services. With their penetration in a city, a natural phenomenon is the mode shift from conventional modes. Therefore, there is a need for a model, which is capable of capturing this phenomenon. While most existing studies have developed mode choice models consisting of a single shared mobility service, only a few studies of two modes exist. Nevertheless, no study has focused on the development of a joint mode choice model for bike-sharing, car-sharing and ride-hailing services. Hence, the objective of this research is to develop a mode choice model, which is capable of capturing the demand for the aforementioned three services simultaneously. The estimation results show the influence of socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, education, household car-ownership and possession of public transport pass and license), trip-related variables (trip distance and travel time) and supply parameter (fleet size). For example, bike-sharing systems are more likely to be used for trips with distances up to 5 km, while car-sharing and ride-hailing systems are expected to be used for a longer distance range of 2 to 15 km. However, there is a lower probability to use the three services for travel times beyond 30 min. Discussions are included for the integration of the developed mode choice model into the transport simulation systems. In addition, based on the influential factors, policy measures are suggested under the following categories: (i) Finance (e.g., microsubidies), (ii) Infrastructure (e.g., dedicated cycle lanes), (iii) Campaigns and nudges (e.g., social awareness campaigns), and (iv) Service design (e.g., integration with public transport). Especially, measures that benefit women and attract young and older age groups are proposed. Besides the policy measures, the probable demand segments for the three shared mobility services have been identified and summarized, with a focus to integrate them along with public transport for Mobility as a Service (MaaS). This includes how the three services can be streamlined to target different distance categories and socio-demographic groups. The contributions from this study can allow several cities to estimate more accurately the mode shares for the shared mobility services and also to promote sustainable usage of shared mobility services through MaaS platforms.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper aims to investigate how the concept can support the short-haul market in city logistics. Though a few trials have been carried out by using the tram to serve cargo delivery, most of them were suspended or failed due to its substantial investment in dedicated vehicles and even track and inadequate service demand. Therefore, we reviewed the literature and global co-modality schemes. Combined with inputs from stakeholders in Sydney, Australia, we listed the key components of a feasible co-modality solution and conducted a series of numerical tests. We found that co-modality, considering its short dwell time for cargo handling in city transport stations, could be ideal to facilitate consignments with low volume but a very high requirement on time reliability—such as same-day delivery. By providing unaccompanied coverage in the middle mile, co-modality has the potential to save operational costs and bring environmental benefits. We presented the delivery process, business model canvas and technical capability of a prototype co-modal journey, and presented the opportunities, challenges, and potential benefits for future investigation.",0965-8564,Not found

Based on a sample of 3260 California residents from the 2018 California Panel Survey, this study explores the impacts of latent attitudes, socio-demographic characteristics, and neighborhood effects on consumers’ current vehicle fuel type choice and their interest in purchasing or leasing an AFV in the future. One joint integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model is estimated to understand the taste heterogeneity within different population segments. The results suggest that latent attitudes towards environment, new technologies, car-utilitarianism, and residential location preference play critical roles in individuals’ adopting new vehicle technologies. A range of socio-demographics, including age, race, gender, student status, education level, income level, household size, housing tenure, housing type and residential parking also make effects. Exposure to BEVs in both residential location and worksite has positive influence on AFV adoption, although public EV charging stations were not found to be essential factors since our respondents may mainly rely on home chargers. Moreover, the study suggests that individual’s current user experience with AFVs has positive effect on their future interest in AFV. Overall, we predict the maximum market penetration of AFVs could be 41% of adult population. The findings offer detailed guidance on crafting California’s transport policy to promote AFV, regarding the heterogeneity of the population's preferences and attitudes.",0965-8564,Not found
Modeling of low-risk behavior of pedestrian movement based on dynamic data analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2022.103576,168,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Pedestrian movements constitute a complex self-organizing system in which various potential risks and conflicts are introduced by the accumulation of randomness and inconsistency over time. Due to the lack of relevant data, knowledge of low-risk behavior identification and risk formation mechanisms in pedestrian movement is insufficient. In this study, we present probable risk indicators reflecting the consistency of a crowd’s state and establish a pedestrian risk identification model that provides an early warning method for safety and security management. A complete pedestrian movement risk identification process is summarized by converting real-world video files into calculable data via video recognition technology, making it possible to identify and obtain crowd risk information in real-time and locate abnormal phenomena. The process makes extensive use of hierarchical and machine learning methods for identifying pedestrian states, proposes quantified conflict-prone and congestion-prone indices to classify different risk types, and defines an improved “crowd risk” index for locating potential crowd dangers. The combination of video recognition technology with machine learning has apparent advantages in solving potential risks in pedestrian movement, particularly in terms of the risk identification rate, the effectiveness of the risk classification, and the accuracy of risk positioning. Results showed that the three-stage risk identification process could accurately determine congestion and conflicting risks and indicate the potential risk-prone in the crowd. The proposed method has significantly improved the output and description accuracy compared with other methods in terms of risk positioning.",0965-8564,Not found

Being a new technology, there is significant uncertainty on adoption by users. There is a need for studies on the user acceptance of autonomous vehicles. This study aims to assess user acceptance of FAVs in a middle-income country, Iran, by adopting and comparing three popular user acceptance models: Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The data were collected via an online survey of 1381 drivers (with valid driver’s license) from different cities in Iran. The results showed that while 49.4% of participants had never heard of FAVs, the majority of them showed a high intention to use FAVs in the future. All three models successfully explained the behavioral intention to use FAVs. The TPB model was the best performing model to represent acceptance, which explained 70.9% of the variance in behavioral intention with subjective norms as the strongest predictor of the model, followed by attitudes toward FAVs as a significant predictor of intention to use them. The UTAUT model constructs accounted for 69.6% of the variance in intention, followed by the TAM model, which explained 57.6% of the variance in intention to use FAVs. Considering that the study on public perceptions of FAVs in middle-income countries is almost non-existent in the literature, it is expected that the current study will be a benchmarking resource for a comparative study for countries with a similar socio-economic and cultural context as the current study.",0965-8564,Not found
Commuter departure time choice behavior under congestion charge: Analysis based on cumulative prospect theory,10.1016/j.tra.2022.103564,168,2023-02-01,2023,2,"An often-overlooked problem in the evaluation and prediction of congestion charge policies is commuters’ bounded rationality. Although some studies have sought to account for this using cumulative prospect theory (CPT), the specific behavioral parameters that reflect travelers’ decision-making process in response to congestion charge scenarios are based on assumptions and lack empirical evidence. This paper aims to provide empirical evidence to define the shape parameters in CPT—while accounting for systematic heterogeneity due to commuters’ characteristics—in order to build more realistic behavioral models for car commuters’ departure time choice behavior under congestion charge scenarios. A stated preference (SP) experiment with four time-based congestion charge scenarios is designed to obtain commuters’ departure time choices when facing uncertain travel conditions. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to estimate the CPT coefficients that reflect car commuters’ cognitive biases under the congestion charge. The results suggest that commuters’ departure time choice under the congestion charge policy is consistent with the assumption of CPT. We find evidence of risk-averse and risk-taking behavior, loss aversion, and large distortion in probability weighting, and individuals’ personal and commuting characteristics had heterogeneous effects on CPT coefficients. The results shed light on travelers’ behavioral responses to congestion charge schemes and provide an important empirical reference.",0965-8564,Not found
Microtransit deployment portfolio management using simulation-based scenario data upscaling,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103584,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Due to transportation technologies having such heterogeneous impacts on different communities, there needs to be better tools to evaluate the deployment of emerging technologies with limited data. Microtransit is one such technology. We propose a novel framework based on existing methods to “upscale” the limited data available so that further decision-support analysis and forecast modeling can be achieved where none could prior. The framework involves expanding an initial day-to-day adjustment process to handle both first/last mile access trips and direct trips, updating a within-day microtransit simulator with a parametric design, and developing a synthetic scenario generation process. The framework is tested in a case study with data from Via for Salt Lake City, Austin, Cupertino, Sacramento, Columbus, and Jersey City showing an average 18% ridership error for the market equilibrium models. Data from four of those cities are upscaled to 326 synthetic scenarios to estimate forecast models for ridership and fleet vehicle-miles-traveled using Lasso regularization. While the models have root mean squared error (RMSE) values between 37-45% of the averages, using only four cities’ data alone would not produce any forecast model at all. The results show that variables with statistically significant positive impact on ridership and negative impact on vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) include zones with more transit stations, higher employment, but lower “employment density × fixed fare”. The models are then used to identify two alternative portfolios with similar fleet VMT as the original four cities but are forecast to have up to 1.9 times the ridership.",0965-8564,Not found

The commercial traffic includes the freight trip generation (pick-ups and deliveries), service trip attraction (service visits to establishments), and e-commerce deliveries, altogether referred to as freight and service activities (FSA) in this study. The methodology includes a simulation model incorporating FSA demand estimation, probability distributions for FSA duration, and industry sectors at the 2-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) level. The authors validated the model through a case study of the SoHo commercial complex's parking demand in New York City (NYC) (Campbell et al., 2018). In addition, the study analyzes the magnitude of the parking issue in NYC comparing five ZIP codes in Midtown Manhattan, which generate the highest commercial demand in the city. The study extends the analysis to the busiest ZIP codes in six cities in the US (Austin, TX; Columbus, OH; San Jose, CA; Seattle, WA; Washington DC; Boston, MA). The results show that the parking spaces required during peak hours at the denser areas (i.e., ZIP codes in Manhattan) cannot be accommodated by the available on-street parking capacities. The authors tested four demand management initiatives to reduce the peak-hour needs. The off-hours strategy, which indicates 30 % of freight pick-ups and deliveries and 51 % of service visits shifting to the off-hours, is the most effective one, with the potential to reduce daytime parking needs by 30 %.

New metro and subjective wellbeing among older people: A natural experiment in Hong Kong,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103592,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Research into transport and subjective wellbeing impacts at older ages is at an early stage. It is still unclear whether the transport intervention (e.g., new transport infrastructure) can effectively promote older people’s subjective wellbeing, and if so, through what pathways. This paper provided causal inference on the effects of public transport infrastructure on evaluative, hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing among older adults using a natural experiment of a new metro line in Hong Kong. A longitudinal survey of 449 cohort participants was collected before and after the new metro operation. Treatment groups lived within a 400 m walking buffer of the new metro stations, while control groups were located around comparable stations on existing metro lines. These metro lines were planned at the same time using similar principles, but the intervention line was built later due to difficulties in financial models. Our Difference-in-Difference (DID) modelling results suggested that it might be difficult to delineate a direct pathway from public transport infrastructure provision to subjective wellbeing improvement among older people. The causal linkage was more plausible for the new metro could contribute to the subjective wellbeing only if older people can adapt to it; for those who wanted to maintain or increase bus use after the metro intervention, we found a negative association with better subjective wellbeing.

Various attributes of every trip, such as time, distance, purpose, companions, and mode, along with mode-specific positive attitudes/social support, children’s perception about their independent mobility, and demographic information (e.g., age, cell phone ownership), were included in the data analysis. This paper analyzed 2131 trips reported by 487 Japanese junior high school students (12–15 years old) living in rural areas using partial least square structural equation modeling. Apart from the main model (including all trips), separate models were developed for different mode categories and three Japanese towns. Analyses revealed a significant and positive association between travel-related well-being and life satisfaction with five domains of self, school, friends, family, and living environment in all the models except the one developed for public transport trips. Furthermore, we found a strong positive relationship between mode-specific positive attitudes and better moods during the trip in all the models. Older children usually had greater perceived independent mobility distance, resulting in happier feelings while traveling actively and using public transport. In addition, longer-distance trips were associated with better travel feelings and higher reported life satisfaction in two study areas with more of a rural character. The mode-specific models also indicated that car trips were associated with happier feelings for leisure activities. In contrast, active trips ignited better moods in trips with the “maintenance” purpose (e.g., going shopping, getting a haircut). The rest of the results were inconsistent among the models highlighting the unique nature of transport modes and living environments in accommodating children’s daily mobility and associated feelings.",0965-8564,Not found
Escape theory: Explaining a negative motivation to travel,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103603,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"In this paper we assume that people could travel in some cases to escape from something, such as their family, colleagues, or residential or work area. The concept of escaping as a driver to travel complements both the mainstream assumption that travel is a derived demand and the idea that people sometimes travel for the fun of it (and thus derive a positive utility from travelling), and has its origin in sociological literature. We categorize forms of escaping, and link travel to escape (TtE) to other concepts such as travel time budgets. Next we propose a first conceptual model relating factors explaining the motivation for escaping from something, or being able to escape from something, and the subsequent travel behaviour. We then formalize the travel behaviour model with general functions incorporating the role of travel to escape. Next we present the results of a first, small, empirical study showing that some people recognize the concept of escaping. In addition, we discuss the implications of travel motivated by escaping from something, one implication being that there will be more travel than if the concept does not apply, and another implication being the potentially positive value of a low level of accessibility, rather than the high level customarily assumed to be more desirable.

Analyzing autonomous delivery acceptance in food deserts based on shopping travel patterns,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103589,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Food desert communities in the US have a widely recognized gap between the demand for healthy foods and the minimum order size that makes it worthwhile for food purveyors to deliver to such neighborhoods, thereby creating delivery deficiencies. A diverse set of mobility constraints and activity-travel patterns exist for disadvantaged segments in these communities, especially the elderly, unemployed, and socially excluded. Appreciating this complexity, an effective solution would be to improve the food access of such communities by providing faster, inexpensive, and flexible online deliveries of healthy foods. However, little is currently known about the shopping travel pattern in food desert communities and the associated mobility inequalities. This paper fulfills this critical research gap and quantifies the differences in shopping travel behavior observed among consumers residing in food deserts and food oases using data collected from Portland and Nashville Metropolitan areas. The paper subsequently captures the perceived acceptance of autonomous delivery robots (ADRs) among these consumers to overcome their mobility inequalities. The results indicate that food desert residents aged between 18 and 25 years, African Americans and those earning more than $75,000 are more likely to engage in internet shopping than food oasis residents. Despite the perceived potential of ADRs to reduce the mobility inequalities in food deserts, acceptance levels for this emerging technology are found to be significantly less among food desert residents, especially among older generational cohorts and less qualified.

Nonlinear effects of fare discounts and built environment on ridesplitting adoption rates,10.1016/j.tra.2022.103577,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"As a new mode of shared mobility that allows users to share the same trip (vehicle) with others at a low travel cost, ridesplitting reduces environmental pollution and eases traffic congestion. Although the relationship between the built environment and the ridesplitting adoption rates has been explored before, few studies investigated the effect of fare discounts on the ridesplitting adoption rate (proportion of ridesplitting trips to ride-hailing trips) while controlling for the origin and destination characteristics. Thus, we explored this topic by analyzing the ride-hailing trip data of Chicago from January to May 2019. The generalized additive model was used to investigate the nonlinear impacts of built environment variables (e.g., population density and employment density) and travel attributes (fare discount and median trip distance) on ridesplitting adoption rates. One notable finding is that the fare discount is most effective in improving ridesplitting adoption rates when its value is around 0.23. In addition, because the trip fare is rounded to the nearest $2.50, a sensitivity analysis was performed to make sure that the approximation had a limited impact on the study results. Finally, the origin–destination (OD) pairs with a high potential for improving the ridesplitting adoption rate were identified. These OD pairs are the trips related to the airports and the trips from the north to downtown. The findings can help transportation planners and government agencies identify the areas for ridesplitting improvement and provide guidelines for transportation network companies to set appropriate fare discounts for ridesplitting.",0965-8564,Not found
Understanding the landscape of shared-e-scooters in North America; Spatiotemporal analysis and policy insights,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103602,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Shared-e-scooters are being introduced in cities worldwide, with their introduction often being distant from the actual service characteristics understanding, potential benefits, and threats realization. This research explores scooter use by examining approximately nine million scooter trips from five North American cities (Austin; TX, Calgary; AB, Chicago; IL, Louisville; KY, Minneapolis; MN). By investigating the spatiotemporal hourly and daily use, we found that demand patterns tend to be similar in the different cities. Trip characteristics (speed, duration, and distance) are almost empirically consistent across the five cities; however, there is evidence that trip characteristics change over time in the same city. We also examined the impact of exogenous factors on scooter demand, and found that weather (temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and snow), day of the week, infrastructure (bike lanes, sidewalks, and shared bike stations), sociodemographics (gender, age, and income), land use, and accessibility to transit significantly impact demand. Findings highlight the need for evidence-based examination of shared-e-scooters and regulatory processes to guide policy decisions by the different stakeholders.",0965-8564,Not found
A model of household shared parking decisions incorporating equity-seeking household dynamics and leadership personality traits,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103585,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Shared parking is viewed increasingly important as a way to alleviate parking problems in urban areas. To maximize the effect of shared parking initiatives, it is critical to understand the decision of households to share private parking spaces. Current models of household decision-making fail to adequately address equity seeking/avoiding household dynamics, which may negatively affect model validity. In this study, a model, which overcomes this theoretical concern, is introduced and estimated to understand the household shared parking participation decision. Specifically, the concept of leadership personality is used, jointly with individual and household characteristics, to specify the decision weight of each spouse of a couple. A choice experiment, in which individual members of couples first answer the choice questions individually and independently, and then jointly complete the choice questions, is designed to estimate the model. Estimation results, based on data collected in Qingdao, China, support the proposed model. Results show that intra-household interactions influence the households’ shared parking participation decision and that households favor alternatives that provide higher equality. Age, leadership personality, household structure, and household financial management are significantly related to household member decision weights.",0965-8564,Not found
Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS): A latent class cluster analysis to identify Dutch vehicle owners’ use intention,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103608,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"A restructuring of the current mobility and transportation system seems to be inescapable, as a result of the increasing urbanization and challenges regarding global sustainability. The concept of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is regarded by policy-makers as an answer to the needed change. Generally speaking, MaaS is an online platform that enables users to plan, book and pay a trip out of a variety of transport modes, conventional and shared. However, in the literature, the potential impact of MaaS on mobility is still relatively unclear. This study, therefore, aims to provide insights into which factors influence the intention to use MaaS among private vehicle owners, who have until now been identified as relatively MaaS-averse travellers. Policy-makers are highly interested in this group to start using MaaS since their shift from private vehicles to other transport options might positively contribute to easing the congestion and environmental problems. In order to create some insights on possible travel behavioural shift and adoption of new systems, an empirical study has been conducted among (co–)owners of motorized vehicles (passenger car, electric passenger car, van, motorcycle; moped) that live in the Netherlands. The survey was based on a conceptual model that explains why people would use this new system (MaaS) and has asked respondents about their travel behaviour, socio-economic characteristics and attitudes towards MaaS. Using Latent Class Cluster Analysis (LCCA) five clusters in the sample population regarding the intention to use MaaS were identified. The cluster profiles show that private vehicle owners who often use public transport and active modes are most inclined to use MaaS, whereas the ‘conservative’ passenger car owners who use the car as their main mode of transport for all their trips (e.g. commuting, leisure) show a lower intention to use MaaS. As it can be expected that the societal benefits of MaaS will especially occur when these conservative car owners adopt MaaS, we conclude that, from a policy perspective, implementing MaaS could be less effective in reducing transport externalities (e.g. pollution and wasted time in congestion) as perhaps expected.",0965-8564,Not found
Flexible-route integrated passenger–freight transport in rural areas,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103604,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The concept of integrated passenger–freight transport has been developed mostly in urban areas and for long-haul trips. In this paper, its adoption is also proposed in rural areas, identifying some margin to develop the solutions adopted so far, which rely mainly on demand-responsive transport (DRT), and provide a reliable and efficient transit service. A methodological framework for developing and evaluating an innovative service called integrated demand-responsive transport (I-DRT) is presented, which combines the integrated passenger–freight scheme with the adoption of DRT. Thanks to the Osterwalder Business Model Canvas, the requirements in terms of infrastructure, vehicles, and personnel are presented, together with the implementation costs, revenues, and the partners to be involved. We recommend evaluating the performance of the service with selected financial, operational, environmental, and social key performance indicators (KPIs). To verify the practical suitability of I-DRT, its adoption in the Italian municipality of Misano Adriatico was proposed and evaluated using selected KPIs. The results of our analysis revealed a reduction in kilometres travelled, fuel consumption, and air pollutants, together with an increase in the area covered by the service, increase in daily potential deliveries (for freight transport), and increase in the occupancy rates of vehicles (for passengers). Assuming a 5-year implementation of the service, an overall reduction in costs is also registered. These results confirm the potential of I-DRT; however, solving some issues related to legislation, policy, and stakeholder involvement may allow for more robust and long-lasting outcomes.",0965-8564,Not found
How does high-speed rail affect tourism development? The case of the Sichuan-Chongqing Economic Circle,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103588,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Using a panel data set of 36 cities in the Sichuan-Chongqing Economic Circle in China from 2011 to 2019, this study adopts a spatial difference-in-differences (SDID) model to analyze the effect of high-speed rail (HSR) on urban tourism development. The results show that HSR operation can significantly promote the development of urban tourism. The spatial autoregressive parameter is 0.3, indicating a positive spatial spillover effect on tourism flows. Our conclusion still holds after a series of robustness tests, including using the PSM-SDID model and placebo test. Second, we find that the impact of HSR on tourism increases by year, peaking in the third year. Third, HSR has a greater impact on cities with less developed road transport and immature tertiary industries. Finally, we confirm the substitution effect between HSR and air transport.",0965-8564,Not found
A disaggregate model of passenger-freight matching in crowdshipping services,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103587,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Crowdshipping (CS) is an emerging form of freight transport that is expected to reduce the externalities of urban freight transport. The supply of CS services originates from people with an intention to travel, who can choose to engage in a parcel delivery service as incidental carrier. The popular expectation is that this consolidation of freight and passenger trips could save freight trips and thus alleviate urban transport congestion and environmental pollution. A key challenge in the prediction of CS service volumes and impacts, however, is to match existing service demand and supply. This has not yet been addressed in the literature with models that give an empirically realistic representation of individual decision-making. We approach this problem using a disaggregate activity-based models for urban passenger transport and freight transport. Allocation of parcels to travellers is done based on a simulated random utility discrete choice model. We present a first case study for the city of The Hague, The Netherlands, to illustrate empirically the model. Our findings suggest that CS could result in increased CO2 emissions and total vehicle distances travelled.",0965-8564,Not found

The estimated structural breaks and piecewise relationship between Australia’s automobile gasoline consumption and household disposable income are consistent with economic intuition. Moreover, the heterogeneity in their relation across various quantiles and over different time periods divided by the identified structural breaks is revealed in a systematic manner. The comparison with a state-of-practice approach demonstrates the validity and efficiency of our approach.",0965-8564,Not found
Government interventions in regional airline markets based on aircraft size—Welfare and environmental implications,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103593,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Airlines can deploy small-sized regional aircraft or narrow-bodied aircraft (with more seats) to fly regional airline routes. Although narrow-bodied aircraft is more emission-efficient on a per-seat basis, the load factor of narrow-bodied aircraft could be lower due to less traffic on regional routes. Thus, small-sized regional aircraft could emit less on a per-flight or per-passenger basis. This study establishes an integrated economic model to examine how government interventions on aircraft size in the regional markets can affect both social welfare and carbon emissions. Two real policies adopted in China to promote the use of small-sized regional aircraft are analyzed and benchmarked, namely the tax exemption and direct subsidies for airlines deploying small-sized regional aircraft. Our theoretical findings suggest that, when compared to the benchmark case with no policy, the tax exemption can bring higher social welfare, but also more total emissions. Compared to the tax exemption policy, the subsidy policy may result in both higher social welfare and fewer emissions. However, a welfare-maximizing level of the subsidy might lead to more emissions than the tax exemption policy or the case without any policy. Both policies would reduce government tax revenues that could be used to improve other aspects of the aviation sector. When this cost of public funds is taken into account, the tax exemption policy is further unfavored. There exist certain levels of subsidies that would lead to no-worse social welfare than the case of no policy, while it becomes more difficult for the subsidy policy to help reduce total emissions.",0965-8564,Not found

Our data is based on over 1,600 people for which we observe all trips during eight weeks before the pandemic and until May 2021. We find an overall reduction of travel distances by 60 percent, followed by a gradual recovery during the subsequent re-opening of the economy. Whereas driving distances have almost completely recovered, public transport re-mains under-used. The introduction of a requirement to wear a mask in public transport had no measurable impact on ridership. The individual travel response to the pandemic varies along socio-economic dimensions such as education and house-hold size, with mobility tool ownership, and with personal values and lifestyles. We find no evidence for a significant substitution of leisure travel to compensate for the reduction in work-related travel.",0965-8564,Not found
Examining the effects of Automated Mobility-on-Demand services on public transport systems using an agent-based simulation approach,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103583,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Several cities worldwide have been attempting to adopt “car-lite” policies to reduce traffic congestion and urban pollution. In addition to measures such as re-designing neighbourhoods and encouraging active modes, much expectation has been placed on the adoption of new and innovative modes, particularly shared AVs, or Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMOD). Although the realisation of AMOD appears to be imminent, little is known about its potential effects on current transport systems. In this paper, using SimMobility, an agent-based microsimulation platform, we explored the impact of AMOD on public transport (PT). Two AV adoption scenarios were simulated: (1) “Partial Automation” where AMOD is introduced alongside existing modes, and (2) “Full Automation” where the use of private human-driven vehicles is prohibited upon the implementation of AMOD. We found that, compared to the base case (where there is no AMOD), the share of PT usage decreased significantly in the Partial Automation scenario whereas it increased in the Full Automation scenario. While the overall congestion level was reduced in the Full Automation scenario, road in the Partial Automation scenario tended to suffer from high travel demand. The increased demand for PT also prompts for a revision of current service schedules. The temporal and spatial analyses of PT demand between scenarios have brought some useful implications on the implementation of AMOD for urban and transport planners.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper proposes a novel COVID-19 multiple outbreak analysis method (NCMOA), dividing the impact scope and degree under multiple COVID-19 disturbances, and using the recovery rate and accumulated loss to quantify the impacts on air passenger flow. A case study based on Chinese national air traffic flow is executed, and the recovery patterns and the differentiated disturbances are analyzed. Results show that air passenger flow recovers with a similar pattern after the first outbreak, and subsequent outbreaks cause local effects and cannot affect the overall recovery pattern. Further, the heterogeneous influence factors and trends on the epi-centers (EC) and the nation are analyzed. In addition, the methods and results of this paper quantify the impact of COVID-19 on air passenger flow at a more detailed level under multiple disturbances.

Integrating parcel deliveries into a ride-pooling service—An agent-based simulation study,10.1016/j.tra.2022.103580,169,2023-03-01,2023,3,"This paper examines the integration of freight delivery into the passenger transport of an on-demand ride-pooling service. The goal of this research is to use existing passenger trips for logistics services and thus reduce additional vehicle kilometers for freight delivery and the total number of vehicles on the road network. This is achieved by merging the need for two separate fleets into a single one by combining the services. This research provides an extensive literature review and discusses policy measures supporting such a service. To evaluate the potential of such a mobility-on-demand service, this paper uses an agent-based simulation framework and integrates three heuristic parcel assignment strategies into a ride-pooling fleet control algorithm. Two integration scenarios (moderate and full) are set up. While in both scenarios passengers and parcels share rides in one vehicle, in the moderate scenario no stops for parcel pick-up and delivery are allowed during a passenger ride to decrease customer inconvenience. Using real-world demand data for a case study of Munich, Germany, the two integration scenarios together with the three assignment strategies are compared to the status quo, which uses two separate vehicle fleets for passenger and logistics transport. The results indicate that the integration of logistics services into a ride-pooling service is possible and can exploit unused system capacities without deteriorating passenger transportation. Depending on the assignment strategies nearly all parcels can be served until a parcel to passenger demand ratio of 1:10 while the overall fleet kilometers can be decreased compared to the status quo.",0965-8564,Not found
A household perspective on the commuting paradox: Longitudinal relationships between commuting time and subjective wellbeing for couples in China,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103640,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Research on the experienced utility of commuting time is dominated by an individualistic view of choice concerning the trade-offs between long commutes and job- or housing-related benefits. The widely discussed phenomenon of the commuting paradox shows that individuals systematically report worse subjective wellbeing as commuting time increases over time, indicating the incomplete trade-offs and net disutility for long commutes at the individual level. This paper takes a household perspective and conducts one of the first longitudinal studies on the gendered relationship between commuting time and subjective wellbeing in China. Drawing upon the China Health and Nutrition Survey between 2006 and 2015, we used seemingly unrelated regression models and fixed-effect models not only to compare the within-individual effect but also to investigate the spill-over effect of commuting time on life satisfaction between matched samples of husbands and wives. We additionally examined the role of preschool-aged children and co-residence with their grandparents in the gendered commuting-wellbeing relationship. The results supported the individual-level commuting paradox, considering that both partners had lower levels of life satisfaction with the increase of their own commuting time. Interestingly, husbands’ life satisfaction was more negatively affected by wives’ commuting time than vice versa, while wives’ commuting utility was more related to the great time pressure from childcare and the social support from extended family members. Our research findings have implications for urban planning and governance policies which aim at mitigating job-housing mismatch, delivering accessible childcare services and transforming gendered social norms.",0965-8564,Not found
Analysis of taste heterogeneity in commuters’ travel decisions using joint parking– and mode–choice model: A case from urban India,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103610,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"In developing countries like India, the policymakers have largely focused on supply-side measures, yet demand-side measures have remained unaddressed in policy implications. Ample literature is available presenting responses of TDM strategies, but most studies account mode choice and parking choice behaviour separately rather than considering trade-offs between them. This paper seeks to fill this gap by admitting parking choice as an endogenous decision within the model of mode choice behaviour which can present more valuable insights in understanding travel behaviour. This study integrates attitudinal factors and built-environment variables in addition to parking and travel attributes for developing comprehensive estimation results. A hybrid discrete choice model with random coefficients is estimated using hierarchical Bayes approach based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation method. The results reveal significant influence of mode/parking specific attitudes on commuters’ choice behaviour in addition to the built-environment factors and mode/parking related attributes. It is identified that considerable shift is occurring between parking-types in preference to switching travel mode with hypothetical changes in parking attributes. Besides, study investigates the heterogeneity in the willingness-to-pay (WTP) through follow-up regression models, which provides important insights for identifying possible sources of this heterogeneity among respondents.

“The impact of energy efficiency and decarbonisation policies on the European road transport sector”,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103623,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"This paper analyses historical energy consumption trends of the EU road transport sector and examines the role of key determinants, such as economic and population growth, fuel prices, passenger and tonne-kilometres and vehicle fleet characteristics. In light of the EU 2030 and 2050 energy and climate targets, the paper assesses the energy efficiency and decarbonisation progress from 2000 to 2018. A detailed analysis is carried out using a balanced panel dataset from 1995 to 2018 and a test for causality between energy consumption and the selected explanatory variables. The results suggest that the declining trend of the normalised energy consumption of cars, trucks and light vehicles, which both dropped significantly in 2018 compared to 2000, can be related to energy efficiency and decarbonisation policies adopted by the EU and its Member States over the studied period. Decomposition analysis based on the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index technique confirms the role of energy efficiency gains in curbing energy consumption of road transport, even with the strong upward force exerted by motorisation and population effects, especially in passenger transport. It also suggests that during the recession years (2008–2013), road transport consumption fell due to a sharp drop in the mileage but not in the motorisation effect, which continued to drive up consumption even in this period. Despite some positive developments, the increased demand for road transportation has led to continued energy consumption growth. This has been further compounded by differences between real-world and vehicle certification fuel consumption data. The article highlights the need to strengthen the current policy framework at the EU and MS levels in the next decade to reach the long-term decarbonisation targets. In the context of these targets, a more in-depth investigation of the real impact of energy efficiency and decarbonisation efforts will also become increasingly important.",0965-8564,Not found
Change in departure time for a train trip to avoid crowding during the COVID-19 pandemic: A latent class study in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103628,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"After the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, crowding has been highlighted as a risk factor for contracting acute respiratory infections (ARIs) such as COVID-19, which has affected the demand for public transport. Although several countries, including the Netherlands, have implemented differential fare systems for peak and off-peak travel to reduce crowding during the rush hours, the problem of overcrowding on trains has remained prevalent and is expected to cause more disutility than even before the pandemic. A stated choice experiment in the Netherlands is conducted to understand the extent to which people can be motivated to change their departure time to avoid crowded trains during rush hours by offering them real-time information on on-board crowding levels and a discount on the train fare. To gain further insights into how travelers respond to crowding and capture unobserved heterogeneity in the data, latent class models have been estimated. Unlike the previous studies, the respondents were segregated into two groups before the start of the choice experiment based on their indicated preference to schedule a delay earlier or later than their desired departure. To study the change in travel behavior during the pandemic, the context of different vaccination stages was also provided in the choice experiment. Background information collected in the experiment was broadly categorized as socio-demographic, travel and work-related factors, and attitudes towards health and COVID-19. It was found that the coefficients obtained for the main attributes which were presented in the choice experiment (on-board crowd levels, scheduled delay and discount offered on full fare) were found statistically significant, and in line with previous research. It was concluded that when most of the people are vaccinated in the Netherlands, the travelers become less averse to on-board crowding. The research also indicates that certain groups of respondents, such as those who are highly crowd averse, and are not students, can be motivated to change their departure time if real-time crowding information was provided. Other groups of respondents who were found to value fare discounts can also be motivated to change their departure by similar incentives.",0965-8564,Not found
Impacts of congestion pricing on ride-hailing ridership: Evidence from Chicago,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103639,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"To combat congestion, promote sustainable forms of transportation, and support the public transit system, Chicago introduced a congestion pricing policy targeting transportation network company (TNC) services on January 6, 2020. This policy aimed to discourage single-occupant and peak-period TNC travel, particularly in high-congestion areas. Using TNC trip record data collected from the Chicago Data Portal, we quantify the impacts of the congestion pricing policy on TNC ridership in Chicago, differentiating between shared and single-occupant trips. Employing a Difference-in-Differences identification strategy, we find that the implementation of the congestion pricing policy led to an increase in shared TNC trip counts and a much larger decrease in single-occupant trip counts. Overall, the policy implementation is associated with a 7.1% reduction of total TNC pickup trips, a 16.4% increase of shared TNC pickup trips and a 11% reduction of single TNC pickup trips. Given the estimated policy effects, we find that the price elasticity of the TNC trip volume in the downtown areas is roughly −0.48. In terms of spatial variation, we find that the lost TNC trips were mainly trips that began and ended in the central business district. The south side of Chicago, which has a high proportion of African-American and low-income residents, shows evidence of single trip reduction for trips that began or ended in the downtown areas due to the policy implementation, but the policy did not seem to incentivize pooling to or from the downtown areas as effectively in the south side as in other regions of Chicago. Regarding the time-of-day variation, we find that the policy is more effective in encouraging trip sharing for off-peak travels than for peak-time travels. Our research provides local planners and policymakers with valuable insights into the impacts of the congestion pricing policy. The method and findings of this research can also be used for other cities that are considering adopting congestion pricing policies on TNCs in the future.",0965-8564,Not found

We focus on a focal question: who or what should be responsible when both human and machine drivers make mistakes in human–machine shared-control vehicles? We examined human judgments of responsibility for automated vehicle (AV) crashes (e.g., the 2018 Uber AV crash) caused by the distracted test driver and malfunctioning automated driving system, through a sequential mixed-methods design: a text analysis of public comments after the first trial of the Uber case (Study 1) and vignette-based experiment (Study 2). Studies 1 and 2 found that although people assigned more responsibility to the test driver than the car manufacturer, the car manufacturer is not clear of responsibility from their perspective, which is against the Uber case’s jury decision that the test driver was the only one facing criminal charges. Participants allocated equal responsibility to the normal driver and car manufacturer in Study 2. In Study 1, people gave different and sometimes antagonistic reasons for their judgments. Some commented that human drivers in AVs will inevitably feel bored and reduce vigilance and attention when the automated driving system is operating (called “passive error”), whereas others thought the test driver can keep attentive and should not be distracted (called “active error”). Study 2’s manipulation of passive and active errors, however, did not influence responsibility judgments significantly.

The most striking difference is that planners place a relatively higher value on aggregate benefits than the public. Planners also place a significantly higher relative value on infrastructure plans that benefit rail transport compared to the public. It is our contention that planners value aggregate benefits relatively more highly because they have a better understanding of the attribute and because they have internalised the long-standing goal of an economically efficient Swedish transport sector.",0965-8564,Not found
Fostering synergy between transit and Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand systems: A dynamic modeling approach for the morning commute problem,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103638,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Autonomous Mobility-On-Demand (AMoD) provides new options for the morning commute problem. The flexibility of AMoD could help to boost the attractiveness and accessibility of Public Transportation (PT). Intermodal AMoD systems could become a competitive alternative to personal cars. However, considering the convenience, comfort, and expected low fares of autonomous vehicles, there is a risk of competition between privately operated AMoD and PT. The joint design of PT and AMoD can foster their cooperation. This study investigates the joint PT-AMoD design problem in a many-to-one multimodal corridor where three transportation alternatives are available: full personal car on a congested freeway, walking and massive rapid transit (MRT), or autonomous vehicle (AV) and MRT. We introduce a simple dynamic model incorporating a time-dependent mode and route choice subject to user equilibrium (UE) constraints. The model presented: (i) accounts for how UE settles and evolves, (ii) provides insight on PT-AMoD cooperation opportunities and competition risks depending on the design choices, (iii) is compatible with design optimization heuristics. We apply the model to a realistic scenario based in the city of Lyon (France). The number of MRT stations, their locations, the number of AV fleets, and their coverage zone boundaries are optimized with a metaheuristic. The optimization is conducted according to three policies regarding AMoD (protectionism, opportunism, liberalism) and three priority objectives (maximize MRT usage, minimize travel times, reduce car usage).

A stated preference survey is designed and conducted to explore the two consecutive choice behaviors: (1) en-route charging and (2) charging route choice. Four model specifications for en-route charging and three for charging route choice are defined. AR uncertainty is, for the first time, considered in explaining en-route charging choice behavior, in addition to the conventional choice attributes such as travel time, charging duration, initial AR, average AR, etc. Socio-demographic and vehicle-related factors are also considered in the behavioral modeling. Furthermore, random parameters logit with error components model is utilized to capture the full panel effects. Results indicate that AR uncertainty significantly affects users’ en-route charging choice behavior, thus being indispensable in behavioral modeling. In addition, average AR can modify the association between AR uncertainty and choice decision. Demand for en-route charging will be overestimated when AR uncertainty is not considered. Furthermore, there is considerable inter-respondentand intra-respondent heterogeneity in the en-route charging choice. The effect of AR uncertainty is stronger for female and high-income BEV users. The findings will contribute substantially to better en-route charging demand estimation and optimal deployment of public charging stations, particularly for medium- to long-distance trips.",0965-8564,Not found
Institutional enablers of electric vehicle market: Evidence from 30 countries,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103612,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a sustainable option for maintaining ecological balance. Extant literature identified a limited set of enablers of EV sales and mostly considered single-country contexts. Interestingly, prior studies rarely employed the lens of institutional theory to probe EV sales. Hence, our study explored how legitimacy concerns, due to societal expectations, are associated with the EV market in a cross-country context. We hypothesized the relationships between institutional pillars, such as technological, business, cognitive pillars, and EV sales. To test our proposed hypotheses, we considered secondary data from 30 countries from 2011 to 2020. We employed panel-corrected standard error multivariate regression analysis to control heteroscedasticity, cross-panel correlation, and autocorrelation. Empirical evidence suggested that legitimacy-induced institutional isomorphism was positively associated with the EV market. Our study aids policymakers in envisaging a sustainable EV ecosystem.",0965-8564,Not found
Airline strategies during the pandemic: What worked?,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103625,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"An examination is conducted of airline strategies during the covid-19 pandemic using data from the United States. Our findings show that airlines pursued diverse strategies in terms of route entry and retention, pricing, and load factors. At the route level, a more detailed examination is conducted of the performance of a middle-seat blocking strategy designed to increase the safety of air travel. We show that this strategy (i.e., not making middle seats available to passengers) likely resulted in revenue losses for carriers, an estimated US $3,300 per flight. This revenue loss provides an indication as to why the middle seat blocking strategy was discontinued by all US airlines despite ongoing safety concerns.",0965-8564,Not found
"Analysing a license plate-based vehicle restriction policy with optional exemption charge: The case in Cali, Colombia",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103618,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Several cities have restricted the use of private vehicles based on the last digit of a vehicle's license plate to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. However, the effectiveness of this measure has been questioned. In 2017, a hybrid scheme, License Plate Restriction Charging (LPRC), was implemented in Cali, Colombia. With this scheme, drivers can pay a charge (monthly, quarterly, or yearly) to circumvent the restriction, while the revenue is used to subsidise the BRT System. Cali was the first city in Latin America to implement such a scheme, while Colombia's capital, Bogota, adopted a similar policy in 2020. This article analyses the evolution of the measure using official information. In addition, we conducted a stated preferences survey and estimated a choice model to evaluate the behaviour of car owners to policy variables. Results show that LPRC price is the most relevant attribute in decision-making. Increasing the number of days with traffic restrictions and extending the hours of vehicle use restriction increases drivers' probability of paying for the LPRC. As currently implemented in Cali, the LPRC is a fixed cost that does not vary according to the car use level, encouraging users who pay for the exemption to use their car as much as possible to make the most out of the payment. Furthermore, the revenue from the charge contributes only marginally to financing the BRT. Finally, we propose several changes in the policy to improve its efficiency. Among them, consider a daily payment and hardening the current driving restriction.",0965-8564,Not found
The effect of trust on the choice for crowdshipping services,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103622,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"The fast growth of e-commerce in urban areas has led to a surge in last-mile transportation demand and an associated increase of external effects: congestion, noise and visual pollution. This paper analyses a new urban freight transport service that has a potential to reduce this footprint: crowdshipping. Crowdshipping is a service where a package is delivered via a traveller who is already making a personal trip for other purposes. The decision of whether or not to use crowdshipping is known to be subject to various service, time and price conditions, including trust in a correct delivery. The effect of trust has not been investigated explicitly, however. We conduct a stated choice experiment and estimate a hybrid choice model with trust as a situation-specific latent variable. The research design allows us to explore how the relevant attributes influence service adoption via trust. We find a significant influence of established choice attributes on service adoption, except for the delivery company’s reputation and the possibility of damage. In addition, all attributes except delivery time have a significant influence on trust. We conclude that trust has a partially mediating effect on the adoption of the service except delivery time, and a fully mediating effect on adoption via reputation and damage.",0965-8564,Not found
E-scooters and other mode trip chaining: Preferences and attitudes of university students,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103636,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Shared e-scooters are mostly used within or close to city centers and they are being seen as a tool for promoting intermodality while often they cover gaps of public transport networks. This study focuses on university students, since they constitute a large proportion of the shared e-scooters market share, and examines their willingness to use shared e-scooters for intermodal trips and their attitudes regarding issues of equity and safety. A survey of 594 university students in the city of Thessaloniki was conducted and their responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and discrete choice model analyses. The results show that as the distance from the city center increases, the levels of satisfaction drop for both the shared e-scooters availability and the quality of public transport services. Students support the opinion that rules should be set so that oblige e-scooter providers to allocate them in a way that the access is possible for the entire population of a city. The results of the discrete choice model analysis suggested that time and cost play a significant role in stated preferences and an intermodal trip including shared e-scooters becomes a preferred option for the students only when the travel time is much shorter (i.e., 20–30 min) comparing to the alternative. Also, transport modes currently used by students, significantly affected their choices. Finally, increased perceived safety of infrastructure and attitudes towards e-scooters increased the probability of preferring the e-scooter alternative. The results of the study pave the way for establishing policies and measures that can enhance the role of shared e-scooters in modern urban mobility systems.",0965-8564,Not found
High-speed rail and happiness,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103635,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"This study empirically examines the effects of high-speed rail (HSR) projects on individual happiness by matching city-level HSR data with individual-level happiness data.

This study constructs instrumental variables, namely, urban slope and area, and performs a series of robustness checks to address the potential omitted variable bias. Results show that in the study of happiness, the omitted variables of the HSR project are less biased. Further analysis reveals that provincial capitals, individuals with a rural hukou, men, the elderly, and healthy individuals are likely to benefit from the HSR project. In addition, the HSR project can improve the happiness of residents through the environment, commodity prices, and income. This study provides a new perspective on the tradeoff between the costs and benefits of HSR projects.",0965-8564,Not found
Behavioural norms or personal gains? – An empirical analysis of commuters‘ intention to switch to multimodal mobility behaviour,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103620,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Existing research has revealed that there is a growing dominance of multimodality in urban areas, which is frequently considered to be an important part of the solution to the burdens associated with heavy car use, such as traffic congestion, noise, and air pollution, as well as associated risks to human health. Yet, while the role of private motorized transport is decreasing in densely populated urban areas, monomodal travel patterns, as exemplified by single occupancy car use, are still dominating work-related mobility. To date, studies on modal shift have investigated the decision-making processes with regard to particular travel modes. However, the intention to switch to multimodal mobility in a commuting context, which may represent a first step towards car use reduction, remains relatively unexplored. Therefore, this paper aims to understand and identify the predecessors of car commuters’ intention to switch to multimodal commuting via an online questionnaire. Our theoretical framework is based on an extension of Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) with Lindenberg and Steg’s Goal-framing Theory (GFT), including a novel fourth goal frame, habit, and person-organisation fit (POF) as additional constructs. Contrary to our expectations, gain and hedonic goals, as well as POF and habit, were not found to affect switching intention. Instead, our findings suggest that a switch to multimodal mobility is strongly dependent on people's normative goals, underlining the need for employers to encourage and reward sustainable multimodal commuting. These findings can assist policy makers, corporate mobility, and HR managers to promote more sustainable, multimodal mobility behaviour.",0965-8564,Not found
A novel modelling approach of integrated taxi and transit mode and route choice using city-scale emerging mobility data,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103615,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"The modelling of mode and route choices of public transport passengers is an essential component of travel demand modelling and transportation planning. Traditionally, choice models are trained using data from revealed and stated preference surveys which are not only cost and time intensive but also suffer from bias due to limitations in sample size. In this article, we present a novel approach utilizing a combination of emerging data sources for non-private modes, namely public transit smart card data, taxi GPS trajectory data, and taxi trips transaction data in order to calibrate an integrated taxi and transit mode and route choice model. We apply our approach for a case study of the taxi and public transport system of Singapore using data sets obtained from the local transport authorities. We solve the first mile and last mile data gaps by overlaying the individual transport nodes against geospatial land use data in order to identify their actual origin and destination points of each journey. To model the behavioural inter-dependencies between the choice of taxi and transit options, we tested a two-level nested logit model and a cross-nested logit model. Along with the commonly included exploratory variables such as in-vehicle travel time, transfer time and number of transfers, our model also incorporates differences in travel cost and separate mode specific constants for peak and off-peak periods. Generic and mode-specific in-vehicle travel time and cost coefficients are tested in the utility functions for the transit and taxi alternatives. Willingness to pay estimates are calculated and compared against similar estimates from Singapore. We also present an application of the model by predicting the mode split between taxi and transit under selected transit and taxi fare change scenarios. Our modelling methodology is highly generalizable and can be applied to other cities with similar data availability.",0965-8564,Not found
"Railway liberalization, airport congestion toll, and infrastructure pricing: Modelling and numerical analysis for European and Chinese markets",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103616,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Regulation on infrastructure pricing affects various aspects, including demand, social welfare, and investment in transport management, as well as intramodal and intermodal competition. This study develops a game theoretic model that derives the charges (set by the infrastructure operators) and fare prices (set by the transport operators) as well as the associated profit and welfare in equilibrium. Key analytical insights concern the joint effect of the product differentiation by the transport operators and profit/welfare orientation of the infrastructure operators. If the transport operator implements more differentiation between air and HSR, or the infrastructure operators are more profit-oriented, the transport mode becomes less sensitive to the access charge from the competing mode, but more sensitive to the access charge from the same mode. Furthermore, using publicly available data for European and Chinese markets, we investigate the effects of introducing HSR on-track competition and congested infrastructures through numerical studies. Key findings are that entry by an incumbent-owned compared to a privately-owned HSR generates more industry benefits but leads to a significant reduction in consumer surplus. A more profit-oriented airport operator leads to increased total welfare if congestion is sufficient high. Theoretical and policy insights are provided.",0965-8564,Not found
Performance evaluation model of transportation infrastructure: Perspective of COVID-19,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103605,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"The transportation systems are facing major challenges due to changes social environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. How to construct a suitable evaluation criterion system and suitable assessment method to evaluate the status of the urban transportation resilience has become a predicament nowadays. Firstly, the criteria for evaluating the current state of transportation resilience involve many aspects. New features of transportation resilience under epidemic normalization are exposed, and previous summaries focusing on resilience characteristics under natural disasters can hardly reflect the current state of urban transportation resilience comprehensively. Based on this, this paper attempts to incorporate the new criteria (Dynamicity, Synergy, Policy) into the evaluation system. Secondly, the assessment of urban transportation resilience involves numerous indicators, which make it difficult to obtain quantitative figures for the criteria. With this background, a comprehensive multi-criteria assessment model based on q-rung orthopair 2-tuple linguistic sets is constructed to evaluate the status of transportation infrastructure from perspective on the COVID-19. Then, an example of urban transportation resilience is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Subsequently, sensitivity analysis about parameters and global robust sensitivity analysis are conducted, and comparative analysis of existing method is given. The results reveal that the proposed method is sensitive to global criteria weights, so it is suggested that more attention should be paid to the rationality of the weight of criteria to avoid the influence on the results when solving MCDM problems.

Public bike users’ annual travel distance: Findings from combined data of user survey and annual rental records,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103619,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"The public bikesharing (PBS) scheme has been recognized as a sustainable transport mode. However, to promote its use, it is crucial to understand the travel behavior of PBS subscribers. This study intends to determine the factors associated with PBS subscribers’ annual public bike distance, which is yet to be noted in the literature. We build up a dataset for the PBS scheme in Seoul, South Korea, by combining its 2019 rental records with a questionnaire survey addressed to its subscribers. The combined dataset containing 1,652 PBS users’ detailed personal information and yearly rental records enables us to explain the subscribers’ annual PBS distance along with their socio-demographic characteristics, travel behavior, perceived benefit from PBS use, and land-use characteristics of their neighborhoods. By adopting mixed-effect gamma regression models, we identify that the heterogeneity of neighborhoods has around 7.5% random effects on subscribers’ annual PBS travel distance on weekdays and weekends. Based on the combined data, we can explain the public bike travel behavior from both a long-term as well as user-oriented perspective. We expect this study to not only enhance policymakers’ and planners’ fundamental understanding of long-term public bike use patterns, but also help them prepare an integrated mobility system in the future.",0965-8564,Not found
"Maritime connectivity, transport infrastructure expansion and economic growth: A global perspective",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103609,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Improving transport connectivity has become increasingly significant to international trade research and transport policy agendas. Little has been done so far to investigate the direct association between maritime connectivity and economic growth, let alone the exact effect magnitude. As the connection between ports, local economies, and global logistics networks becomes ever closer, the economic role of port connectivity deserves closer attention. This paper uses the Panama Canal expansion as a quasi-natural experiment, and proposes a dynamic difference-in-differences (DID) method for making causal inferences about the impact of port connectivity on regional economic growth. This study leverages data mining of multiple sources of satellite data to provide innovative measures of ship movement, port area, and economic activity. We construct an index based on the global shipping network data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to measure the extent to which the ports are exposed to the canal expansion. This allows careful handling of the endogeneity problem. Change in the port area is used as a proxy for port capacity expansion, and is identified via satellite imaging. Night light data provide a measure of regional economic activity around the ports, and of the effect of port connectivity on regional economic growth. Our findings suggest that improvements in port connectivity have a significant and fairly durable stimulating effect on regional economic growth, and that port infrastructure expansion is one potential channel for realizing this effect.",0965-8564,Not found
Social cost of airline delays: Assessment by the use of revenue management data,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103613,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"We develop a schedule delay model using advanced econometrics techniques, while computing the social cost of passenger delays, in order to propose an alternative to the method of defining such cost that is actually found in the literature. This study has been made possible by obtaining private revenue management and operational data directly from a main European legacy airline. Thanks to MNL models, we compute the arrival time preferences, for all groups of passengers, namely arriving or departing, and short or long stay passengers, and for every day of departure that we have collected in our dataset. Then, we compute the effect of the ex-post modification of the arrival time, created by a delay, on the passenger’s utility. We finally compute two effects on the social welfare cost of delays regarding ex-post schedule displacement: the price effect, which is the sensitivity of passengers regarding schedule displacement, and the volume effect measured by the level of airline delays in terms of time. Then, we compare those two effects across the day, in order to consider the social cost of airline delays as a two-effect phenomenon, instead of being only defined by the aggregated airline delay, in terms of time. Our results show that delays are costlier for passengers making the departing portion of their journey, with a short stay upon arrival, and during certain periods of the day. The originality of our paper principally lies in two aspects: first, studies about the precise computation of the social cost of airline delays regarding ex-post schedule displacement do not exist in the literature. Our paper fills this gap by providing an original method aiming at defining this cost. Second, our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to consider the effect of airline delays on the passenger’s utility, at the time of day level, by jointly analyzing revenue management and operational data.",0965-8564,Not found
Predictive distance-based road pricing — Designing tolling zones through unsupervised learning,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103611,170,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Congestion pricing is a standard approach to mitigate traffic congestion in a number of urban networks around the world. The advancement of satellite technology has spurred interest in distance-based congestion pricing schemes, which obviate the need for fixed infrastructure such as gantries that are used in area- and cordon-based pricing. Moreover, distance-based pricing has the potential to more effectively manage traffic congestion. In the context of distance-based congestion pricing, we propose the use of sparse subspace clustering methods employing Elastic Net optimization (SSCEL) and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (SSCOMP), as well as two hierarchical density-based clustering methods, (OPTICS, HDBSCAN*) for the derivation of tolling zones. These tolling zones are then used within a simulation-based framework for real-time predictive distance-based toll optimization to examine network congestion and performance of the tolling schemes. Within this framework, for a given definition of tolling zones, tolling function parameters are optimized in real-time using a simulation-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) model. Guidance information generation is integrated into the predictive optimization framework and behavioral responses to the information and tolls along dimensions of departure time, route, mode, and trip cancellation are explicitly modeled. For the evaluation of network performance we make use of Travel Speed Index (TSI) data from the real-world Boston Central Business District urban network and demonstrate that tolling zones derived from the sparse subspace clustering are an effective means of operationalizing real-time distance-based toll optimization schemes, showing improvements in average travel time and social welfare relative to the baseline.",0965-8564,Not found

To fill the gap, this study proposes an approach to integrate the merits of structural equation models and discrete choice models while accommodating spatial dependence. We apply it to the 2019 household travel survey data from Zhongshan, China. This study shows that spatial heterogeneity is prevalent, and that overlooking the mediating role of car ownership will produce false statistical inference and understate built environment effects. The results suggest that urban growth boundary, densification and bus supply enhancement at residential neighborhoods, and residential development clustered around centers may discourage commuting by car, whereas road investment is counterproductive.",0965-8564,Not found
Driving electric vehicles’ mass adoption: An architecture for the design of human-centric policies to meet climate and societal goals,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103651,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"For a real “green deal” to take place, it is important that technological achievements in the realm of green mobility solutions are paired with novel sustainable and energy efficient mobility models, smart enough to answer the multifaceted needs of their users. Within this challenging context, we set the foundations of a human-centered framework for the analysis and design of policies promoting the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). The proposed data-driven architecture is conceived to leverage the deep intertwining between users’ attitudes, mutual influences and technological traits of EVs to support policy makers in studying the effect that individual characteristics and homophily have on the “natural” spread of EVs, and analyzing the costs and benefits of different intervention policies. By introducing the so-called EV-adoptability DNA, compactly representing the individual predisposition towards EVs, the proposed architecture is intended to be an actionable tool to shape a mobility of the future that is centered on the users’ needs, aiding in the fight of climate change and the lack of inclusiveness in the green transition. Through extensive simulations carried out by assembling the proposed framework with a set of anonymized real mobility data, we show its potential in supporting the design of policies to foster greener mobility habits and in the analysis of their mid-term effects, even when access to social/personal information is denied.",0965-8564,Not found
Effects of configuration elements and traffic flow conditions on Lane-Changing rates at the weaving segments,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103652,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of configuration elements and traffic flow conditions on lane-changing rates at weaving segments. To achieve this, data collected from ten weaving segments, utilizing DJI drones and automatic trajectory extraction technology, was analyzed in the study. The procedure introduced in Highway Capacity Manual (2016) was initially employed to estimate the expected lane-changing rates and identify existing issues. Subsequently, multilevel generalized linear regression models were developed to investigate the relationships between lane-changing rates and the influencing factors. Restricted Maximum Likelihood along with Empirical Bayes was applied to estimate the model parameters. The model results indicate that the Major-Weave II weaving segment exhibits the least lane changes when compared to the other three types of weaving segments under the same traffic flow conditions. Additionally, the types of weaving segments influence how geometric factors and traffic flow conditions affect lane-changing rates. The length and width of a weaving segment have opposite influences on the lane-changing rate. Longer lengths increase traffic flow complexity while more lanes provide additional space for vehicles and reduce complexity. A wider auxiliary road connected to the weaving segment brings more ramp-through vehicles and results in more lane changes due to disturbances in traffic flows. Poor level of service (LOS) typically indicates high lane-changing rates. However, the lane-changing rate rises sharply with increasing volume under LOS B. This may be because the large gaps among vehicles under LOS B prompt vehicles to make more lane changes in search of a better driving environment. The findings of this study can provide valuable insights for designing weaving segments, implementing operational policies, and developing automated driving systems (ADS) for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to reduce lane changes, enhance traffic efficiency, and improve safety.",0965-8564,Not found

In comparison, 36 themes, eight sub-categories and three major categories are extracted for potential customers. The categories, sub-categories, and themes could be interpreted as an itinerary of actions that current and potential customers would like to see in order to improve their experience with the transit service.

Integration planning of freight deliveries into passenger bus networks: Exact and heuristic algorithms,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103645,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"With the increasing population living in cities, a growing number of small daily urban freight deliveries are performed, typically by private companies. Recently, more environmentally friendly urban logistics services have emerged to mitigate the negative effects of such activities. One example is the integration of freight deliveries into bus networks, traditionally dedicated to passenger transportation, to perform urban logistics activities within cities. In this paper, the integration of the freight delivery process into the urban bus passenger network is addressed where freight parcels are dropped by clients at bus hubs located outside the city center, transported by bus services from the hub to bus stops located in the city center, and delivered to the destination address by a last mile operator. Since bus vehicles supporting both passenger and freight flows need to be physically adapted, the aim is to support the decision-maker to select the minimum number of bus services that must be adapted for freight transportation. The optimization problem considers the freight demand uncertainty in terms of number of freight parcels, destination address, delivery time windows and last mile operator constraints which are modelled by a set of demand scenarios. An exact method based on an integer linear programming (ILP) and two heuristic algorithms based on a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) are proposed. The results show that the proposed optimization methods are efficient, giving valuable insights to stakeholders, in the fields of policy and practice, for the strategic decision of selecting the minimum number of buses to be physically adapted for freight transportation. In particular, the results show that all proposed optimization methods are of interest in practice since the type of problem instances for which each method is more efficient is clearly identified in the obtained computational results. Moreover, in the early stages of the integrated passenger and freight flows service, the impact on the required number of adapted bus services is mainly given by the last mile operator capacity of delivering freight from bus hubs to final parcel destinations, while the other factors (delivery time windows and distributions parcel destination addresses) do not have a significant impact on the required number of bus services.",0965-8564,Not found
Perceived benefits as a driver and necessary condition for the willingness of air passengers to provide personal data for non-mandatory digital services at airports,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103659,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The willingness of individuals to provide personal data is of interest to policymakers and practitioners seeking to develop more intelligent transportation systems that create value for passengers using technologies, as well as to leverage the use of data more generally to accelerate digital transformation. This study examines the role of perceived benefits as a driver and necessary condition for the willingness of air passengers to provide personal data for non-mandatory digital services at airports. These are services that are not essential for the operation of the airport or for the safety and security of passengers but can enhance the passenger experience or generate additional revenue for the airport. Examples include receiving notifications to a mobile device about their journey and related products and services, accessing customer services online, joining and receiving electronic information from an airport loyalty programme, and making payments for products and services online or via a mobile application. The analysis is based on two samples of 235 and 218 respondents to an online survey where the second sample is used for the purpose of replication. Responses were analysed using a recently developed complementary approach that combines partial least squares structural equation modeling and necessary condition analysis. The findings confirm that perceived benefits are a significant driver and necessary condition for passengers’ willingness to provide personal data. More so, perceived benefits significantly attenuate the negative effect that privacy concerns have on passengers’ willingness to provide personal data.

However, these asymmetric models can hardly be estimated when the choice sets vary with observations. This paper fills the gap between the asymmetric models and the existing literature, and also adapt the models to route choice by proposing three approaches to further parameterize the shape parameter. This paper also tests the asymmetric models by two independent GPS datasets: taxi data collected in Guangzhou as well as bicycle data collected in Tel Aviv. Comparative analysis is conducted between taxi drivers and cyclists on their route choice behavior. The results indicate the existence of class imbalance in both cases.

Using Spain’s labor force survey data, we employ difference-in-differences models to estimate the effects of HSR services on proportions of workers by economic sector in Spain at the province level. The main results suggest that, while there are national trends in rising service employment and declining manufacturing and agricultural employment, such trends are more significant in Spain’s HSR provinces after—and only after—HSR begins to operate. The labor market effects of HSR services are most likely to be driven by workers’ job changes across economic sectors, i.e., agricultural and manufacturing workers shift to the service sector; we find no significant evidence that HSR services create new employment, change patterns of labor force participation, cause international and internal labor migration, or affect local workers’ human capital characteristics.",0965-8564,Not found
Transition from physical to online shopping alternatives due to the COVID-19 pandemic - A case study of Italy and Sweden,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103644,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Using 530 responses from an online questionnaire, this study aims to investigate the transition from physical to online shopping alternatives during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic at the individual level. The focus areas of the study are Sweden and Italy, two European countries that implemented contrasting prevention measures. This study analyses the impacts of the pandemic on the transition to online shopping activities, and identifies who among the respondents changed their shopping behaviour the most and how; and what the different shopping strategies are and who adopted them. Multivariate statistical analyses, including linear and binary logistic regressions and multinomial logit models, were used to analyse the dataset. In the analysis, the dataset was split between Italy and Sweden to take into account the contrasting prevention measures and the different social and economic backgrounds of the two countries; the results of this study confirm and highlight these differences. Moreover, the socio-demographic and household structures of the respondents were found to influence the amount and the direction of change in shopping behaviour during the first wave of the pandemic. The study also indicates some policies that can be implemented and/or further strengthened to increase the resilience of citizens in facing pandemics and to derive benefit from the behavioural changes that took place during the first wave of the pandemic.",0965-8564,Not found
Comparison of decentralized slot and pricing policies when airports are substitutes for non-local passengers,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103641,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Airport congestion and delays occur when a given infrastructure is heavily utilized. Delays can be controlled by allocating a limited number of permits to users (slot policies) or by increasing the user price (pricing policies). This study analyzes policy choices made by regions with congested airports and compares equilibrium outcomes. The main contribution is to analyze two scenarios in which non-locals consider congested airports as substitutes. The first concentrates on non-local origin–destination passengers, e.g., on leisure trips. The second concentrates on non-local transfer passengers flying, e.g., long distances. The local welfares of airport regions are distinguished from (i) the aggregate welfare of regions with congested airports, and (ii) the aggregate welfare across all regions including the origin regions of non-local passengers. The main policy insight is that the assessments of equilibrium outcomes and prices differ heavily depending on whether they are assessed from (i) the congested airports’ viewpoint, or (ii) the viewpoint of all regions, which creates conflicts of interest between airport groups.",0965-8564,Not found
Virtual leisure activity engagement: The role of childhood technology experience,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103650,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Activity engagement and travel behavior are dynamic concepts that are inherently complex. Recently, the generational transition from baby boomers as the largest generational cohort in the US to millennials has added a layer of complexity to our understanding of activity engagement and travel behavior. The challenge stems in part from the fact that millennials are “digital natives” or the first generation to generally be exposed to technology during childhood, with implications for adulthood preferences, activity and travel behavior. This does come with a potential benefit for the environment via reduced travel more generally and car travel more specifically. In fact, “Peak car” is one hypothesized manifestation of changes brought about by the generational transition that is gaining importance in the literature. Another, less discussed manifestation pertains to the changes in the balance between virtual and physical activities. In this study, we examine the association between millennial-specific factors, such as the childhood experience with technology, and adulthood engagement in virtual rather than physical activities. We do so by applying a comprehensive life-stage approach borrowed from a larger study examining the impacts of the generational shift on travel behavior. Results suggest that individuals who were more technologically-engaged during childhood are associated with higher levels of technology engagement and higher virtual than physical leisure activities as adults. Such results provide important insights at the policy level, helping inform efforts aimed at promoting sustainable travel and provide researchers with a comprehensive framework to tackle research questions related to young people’s travel behavior. This will only gain importance as more “digital natives” become transport users.",0965-8564,Not found
Impact of CR Express and intermodal freight transport competition on China-Europe Route: Emission and welfare implications,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103642,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"China Railway Express (CR Express) has been fast developed, offering an alternative to transportation of the containerized cargo between China and Europe. This paper examines CO2 emissions and social welfare implications of the intermodal competition between the emerging CR Express and incumbent maritime shipping. An analytical model is developed, which shows that the implications depend in general on the relative emission intensities of the two transport modes on a per-trip basis. The entry of CR Express and the resultant intermodal competition, while likely improving welfare, will increase emissions unless CR Express is sufficiently emission efficient. Such impacts on emissions and welfare are enhanced when there are more CR Express operators, or when there are fewer shipping carriers. The competition among Chinese local governments in supporting their own CR Express services also strengthens the impacts. The analytical model is further calibrated with real market and operational data on the route between China’s Yangtze River Delta and Central Europe. Our numerical simulations show that intermodal competition leads to more emissions unless CR Express can achieve an approximately 90% reduction in emission intensity and that overall welfare is nonetheless improved. Policy and managerial implications are discussed.",0965-8564,Not found
Do people act differently while using ridesharing services with children?,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103647,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Children are one of the most vulnerable population groups in traffic crashes. Child safety seats (CSSs) can reduce the severity of crash outcomes for children. The use of CSSs has significantly increased in the U.S. over the last 40 years, but the use of CSSs in popular ridesharing services (RSSs), such as Uber and Lyft, is not widespread. This paper used a publicly available nationwide online survey designed to understand the knowledge and attitudes of drivers and riders toward child passenger safety in RSSs. This study performed a rigorous exploratory data analysis to identify key insights about the survey participants. A recently developed dimension-reduction method was applied to understand the co-occurrence patterns of the responses to gain intuitive insights. Finally, open ended responses of survey participants have been analyzed for further insights. The findings of this study can be used to promote new safety legislation and the use of CSSs in RSSs.",0965-8564,Not found
Adaptive transit design: Optimizing fixed and demand responsive multi-modal transportation via continuous approximation,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103643,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"In most cities, transit consists solely of fixed-route transportation, whence the inherent limited Quality of Service for travellers in suburban areas and during off-peak periods. On the other hand, completely replacing fixed-route (FR) with demand-responsive (DR) transit would imply a huge operational cost. It is still unclear how to integrate DR transportation into current transit systems to take full advantage of it. We propose a Continuous Approximation model of a transit system that gets the best from fixed-route and DR transportation. Our model allows deciding whether to deploy a FR or a DR feeder, in each sub-region of an urban conurbation and each time of day, and to redesign the line frequencies and the stop spacing of the main trunk service. Since such a transit design can adapt to the spatial and temporal variation of the demand, we call it Adaptive Transit. Numerical results show that, with respect to conventional transit, Adaptive Transit significantly improves user-related cost, by drastically reducing access time to the main trunk service. Such benefits are particularly remarkable in the suburbs. Moreover, the generalized cost, including agency and user cost, is also reduced. These findings are also confirmed in scenarios with automated vehicles. Our model can assist in planning future-generation transit systems, able to improve urban mobility by appropriately combining fixed and DR transportation.",0965-8564,Not found
"1,000 HP electric drayage trucks as a substitute for new freeway lanes construction",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103646,171,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Electrification of trucking combined with connected technologies promise to cut the cost of freight transportation, reduce its environmental footprint, and make roads safer. If electric trucks are powerful enough to cease behaving as moving bottlenecks, they could also increase the capacity of existing roads and reduce the demand for new road infrastructure, a consequence that has so far been understudied. To explore the potential speed changes of replacing conventional heavy-duty drayage trucks with electric and/or connected trucks, we performed microscopic traffic simulations on a network centered on I-710, the country’s most important economic artery, between the San Pedro Bay Ports and downtown Los Angeles, in Southern California. In addition to a 2012 baseline, we analyzed twelve scenarios for the year 2035, characterized by three levels of road improvements and four types of heavy-duty port trucks (HDPT). Our results show that 1,000 hp electric/hydrogen trucks (eTs) can be a substitute for additional freeway lanes in busy freight corridors. While conventional HDPTs with CACC would only slightly increase network speeds, replacing conventional HDPTs with eTs and improving selected I-710 ramps should be sufficient to absorb the forecast increases in drayage demand for 2035 without adding a controversial lane to I-710. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the impacts on speed of new vehicle technologies in infrastructure planning. They also suggest shifting funding from building new capacity to financing 1,000 hp connected electric trucks in freight corridors until the market for these vehicles has matured.",0965-8564,Not found
On modeling future workplace location decisions: An analysis of Texas employees,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103671,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"In this paper, we examine work place location (WPL) preferences of workers in an unpredictable and evolving future by investigating how workers would prefer to allocate their monthly working days among the three WPL alternatives of working from home, from the work office, and from a variable third WPL. In contrast to earlier studies that typically focus on telework as a binary of whether an individual is a teleworker or not, we focus our attention on workers’ preferences for specific combinations of all three WPLs over a period of a month (including, but not limited to, only selecting one WPL for all days of the month). In our analysis, we employ the multiple discrete–continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model, using a 2022 stated preference survey of future work preferences of employees residing in the state of Texas. The results indicate that single young women with very young children, those with long commutes and “intolerable” traffic congestion to the work office, individuals with a private study in their homes, self-employed workers, and those in non-essential service occupations have the highest preference for working from home. On the other hand, older men, individuals from low income households, those residing in rural areas, and workers in essential service occupations have the highest preference for the work office. And, for the third WPL, young non-single women with very young children, individuals from low income households, part-time employees, and those in professional, managerial or finance occupations have the highest predisposition. These results should provide valuable insights to urban planners, homebuilders, employers, travel demand modelers, and a whole host of other businesses to achieve specific desired end states. From a data collection standpoint, our study underscores the need to collect detailed information about work patterns in future activity-travel surveys.",0965-8564,Not found
Comparisons of observed and unobserved parameter heterogeneity in modeling vehicle-miles driven,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103614,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"This study examines potential observed and unobserved parameter heterogeneity in modeling vehicle-miles driven (VMD). This application is both important in its own right, and a vehicle for exploring conceptual, mathematical, and empirical differences among three finite-segmentation ways of addressing such heterogeneity: deterministic segmentation and (endogenous) switching for observed heterogeneity, and latent class models for unobserved heterogeneity. Based on empirical data from about 3,000 Georgia residents, we model weekly VMD, and identify key explanatory variables as well as the different sensitivities to those variables exhibited by various population segments. The study posits that people have different sensitivities to explanatory variables by residence type (urban versus “less urban”), and supporting evidence was found in the deterministic segmentation and endogenous switching models. The switching regression model characterized those who are more likely to live in urban areas, e.g. workers, pro-environmental, and those who are less favorable to driving. In addition, the estimated error correlations in the endogenous switching model corroborated that there are unobserved factors common to the joint decisions of residential choice and VMD generation. The latent class model identified lower and higher VMD-inclined segments and had a better goodness of fit than the other two models. The results confirm that (1) there is notable heterogeneity in the population with respect to the weight given to relevant factors that influence VMD, and (2) accounting for both observed and unobserved heterogeneities is useful in modeling VMD.",0965-8564,Not found
What is an ideal (Utopian) mobility as a service (MaaS) framework?

The proposed framework involves a tendering authority that is responsible for a common access platform into which competitive tendered MaaS consortium bids are assessed with multiple ‘winners’ selected to ensure coverage of all multi-modal and multi-service products across the successful bid. Such an approach serves to give users choices and ensure a competitive MaaS market. The tendering authority will be responsible for defining a suite of societal linked key performance indicators (KPIs) that are connected to financial and non-financial rewards available to each MaaS consortium and their subscribers, when they show through the common access framework the changes in travel behaviour that align with the agreed societal KPIs.

"Empirical investigation of lane usage, lane changing and lane choice phenomena in a multimodal urban arterial",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103674,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"The combination of multimodal interactions, dynamic congestion and lane changing phenomena in an urban environment can have a strong impact on traffic flow dynamics, active road capacity and road safety. However, while there is a vast understanding of microscopic traffic models for motorways with respect to lane changes and lane choices, there are not many empirical observations of the phenomena at the urban scale. Recently, new data collection techniques with unmanned aerial systems have emerged offering unique opportunities to study complex traffic phenomena. This paper investigates the interrelation between lane changing and lane choice using the pNEUMA dataset in one of the busiest arterials in Athens, Greece. The main concept relies on the definition of two layers regarding how the multiple lanes of congested arterials are actually being used. Specifically, we show that the marked lanes on the arterial (marked layer) are influenced by the frictions created by static and moving bottlenecks (bus and taxi stops, illegal parking, etc.). Using an existing lane detection algorithm, we show that there is an active layer which is different to the marked lanes on the road affecting capacity in the macroscopic level and driving behavior in the microscopic level. The analysis on lane changing highlights the conflicting areas where more lane changes can occur. Furthermore, the particularity of Powered-Two-Wheelers’ lane changing behavior is examined and evidence on the PTW filtering phenomenon is provided. Following, the analysis on driver lane choice shows how turning vehicles approach the target lane and the differences between left- and right-turning vehicles.",0965-8564,Not found

Drawing on an online survey of 2,510 older Americans, this study used a series of structural equation models to examine the relationship between ICTs and travel among older people. The results show that ICT usage and daily travel for shopping, social and recreational, and healthcare purposes among older Americans are positively related. Of all the predictors, the difficulty of using the Internet is one of the most critical for lower ICT usage for all purposes, all else being equal. The study also provides user profiles for different ICT applications. For example, older people who were still relatively young used social media more. E-health applications were more widely used by people of color. The study also demonstrates racial disparities in e-shopping: African Americans tended to use e-shopping applications less frequently, and also generated fewer in-store shopping trips compared to non-Hispanic Whites. The study implies that there is significant potential in using ICTs to reduce travel difficulties for disadvantaged older people, and it is important to improve older people’s technology literacy.",0965-8564,Not found
Mind the perception gap: The impact of bus rapid transit infrastructure on travelers’ perceptions of affective subjective well-being,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103670,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Over the past 20 years, bus rapid transit (BRT) has been increasingly promoted as an affordable way to improve public transit services in cities around the world. In many places, however, BRT projects have faced community opposition for a range of reasons, such as concerns around loss of private transport space and parking, demand for improved pedestrian and cycle infrastructure, and impacts on streetscapes. This research informs the selection of BRT infrastructure options by considering the perspective of travelers’ affective subjective well-being (SWB). Specifically, in a randomized control trial framework, individuals are presented with photo-simulations of various BRT infrastructure alternatives, and report their psychometric indicators of happiness or perceived safety. We test this approach using an urban corridor approximately2 km in lengthin Boston, exploring the impact of 65 different BRT infrastructure alternatives. We find that: (1) compared to regular bus services, a ‘standard BRT’ consisting of a painted bus lane and the addition of a cycle lane significantly enhances SWB; (2) an ‘SWB infrastructure’ option that replaces car parking with improvements for cyclists and pedestrians and adds street amenities further enhances SWB; and, (3) the BRT infrastructure elements most effective in enhancing affective SWB for users of all transport modes are the addition of green spaces, improvement of crosswalks, and provision of more space for pedestrians and cyclists. This study shows the importance, for citizens’ emotional well-being, of moving from a traditional bus-only approach to multi-modal BRT infrastructures. Future research could integrate this technique into actual participatory planning processes to select the most effective BRT infrastructure in corridors of specific interest, in Boston and beyond.",0965-8564,Not found

State of the BART: Analyzing the Determinants of Bay Area Rapid Transit Use in the 2010s,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103663,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Peaking on public transit—the concentration of ridership in peak times and directions into and out of central areas—has waxed in the U.S. over the past century, as public transit has lost more mode share at off-peak times, in off-peak directions, and among non-commute trips. A notable pre-pandemic manifestation of this chronic problem was on Bay Area Rapid Transit, the San Francisco Bay Area’s regional heavy rail system. While BART staved off an absolute ridership decline longer than most American transit operators in the mid- and late-2010s, it did so almost entirely due to peak gains in riders offsetting off-peak losses. As a result, the system experienced worsening passenger crowding at some times and places, expanding underutilization of capacity at many others, and the prospect of enormous expenditures to accommodate rising transbay passenger demand. To examine the factors driving transit use in the 2010s, we model peak and off-peak BART trips as a function of station area and system characteristics. We uniquely use origin–destination pairs as the unit of analysis in order to separately measure influences at both ends of the trip. We find that transfers and travel time most influence peak and off-peak BART ridership and that station-area employment and time-competitiveness with driving particularly influence peak patronage. Over time in our models, the associations between ridership and transit travel time weakened, while the associations between ridership and transfers, employment, and time-competitiveness with driving grew stronger. In sum, we find that the peaking problem plaguing public transit systems for decades worsened in the years leading up to the pandemic—on this one nationally significant U.S. transit system, at least—which poses potentially substantial financial challenges in the years ahead.",0965-8564,Not found

Within this scope, micro-mobility solutions (MMSs), an extension to the primary urban transportation network, have become even more critical recently. However, when we executed a preliminary investigation concerning MMSs' sustainability, we noted some critical theoretical and managerial gaps: (1) the number of studies assessing MMSs using decision-making approaches is excessively scarce, (2) no paper in the literature deals with the MMSs' sustainability performance, and (3) there are no commonly accepted criteria set to assess the sustainability of the MMSs in the literature. The current study aims to present a practical and robust decision-making framework that can overcome excessively complicated uncertainties to evaluate the sustainability performance of MMSs. Further, it suggests a novel methodological framework, i.e., Delphi, LogarithmicPercentageChange-DrivenObjectiveWeighting (LOPCOW), and Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) methods with interval-valued fuzzy neutrosophic number (IVFNN) information, which can be defined as a reconciliation tool to set the criteria affecting the assessment processes.

How has COVID-19 changed private car use in European urban areas?

The fear of contagion when using public transport or the decrease in road congestion are likely to have induced changes in citizens’ travel habits with respect to cars. This work investigates the impact of the pandemic on individuals’ habits and preferences regarding their car ownership levels and car usage in the European urban context, with a special focus on the role played by individual socio-demographics and urban mobility patterns. For this purpose, a Path Analysis approach has been adopted to model car ownership and use before and after COVID-19. The main data source employed in this research is an EU-Wide Urban Mobility Survey that collects detailed information (individual and household socio-economic characteristics, built environment attributes and mobility habits) of 10,152 individuals from a total of 21 European urban areas of different sizes, geographical locations, and urban forms. The survey data has been complemented with city-level variables that account for differences across the cities that may explain changes in car-related behaviour. The results show that the pandemic has induced an increase in car use among socio-economic groups that are generally associated with low car-dependent behaviour, revealing that policy instruments that discourage the use of the private car in urban areas are needed to avoid reversing past trends in the reduction of urban transport emissions. High-income, well-educated teleworkers are observed to be the ones that have reduced their car use to a larger extent. On the contrary, low-income individuals are mostly maintaining similar levels of car mobility. Finally, frequent public transport users are more likely than occasional users to have substituted this mode by the private car.",0965-8564,Not found
"Differential license plate pricing and electric vehicle adoption in Shanghai, China",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103672,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most direct pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector.

A program of direct financial subsidy is a dominant policy to encourage adoption. This paper investigates an alternative policy based on differential license plate pricing across vehicle types in Shanghai, China’s largest regional EV market. Using monthly vehicle registration data from Shanghai, we find that EV sales would increase by 56%–65% if the differential between ICEV and EV license plate costs rises by 1,000 yuan ($150). We compare differential license plate pricing with the purchase subsidy policy. With a fiscal-neutral policy scheme, differential license plate pricing is more effective for promoting EV adoption than direct purchase subsidies. We also discuss the implications of the ongoing policy change where the free license is no longer granted to plug–in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) buyers starting in 2023. We show that the new policy scheme could still be more effective than subsidies in encouraging battery electric vehicle (BEV) adoption. The new policy scheme, combined with relaxed price ceilings in the ICEV license auction market, will yield comparable or even larger adoption growth than the previous policy.",0965-8564,Not found

Many countries worldwide implemented lockdowns during the COVID-19 outbreaks. However, due to the lack of prior experience and knowledge about the pandemic, it is challenging to deal with short-term polices decision-making due to the highly stochastic and dynamic nature of the COVID-19. Thus, there is a need for the exploration of policy decision analysis to help agencies to adjust their current policies and adopt quickly. In this study, an analytical methodology is developed to analysis urban transport policy response for pandemic control based on social media data. Compared to traditional surveys or interviews, social media can provide timely data based on the feedback from public in terms of public demands, opinions, and acceptance of policy implementations. In particular, a sentiment-aware pre-trained language model is fine-tuned for sentiment analysis of policy. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used to classify documents, e.g., posts collected from social media, into specific topics in an unsupervised manner. Then, entropy weights method (EWM) is used to extract public policy demands based on the classified topics. Meanwhile, a Jaccard distance-based approach is proposed to conduct the response analysis of policy adjustments. A retrospective analysis of transport policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China is presented using the developed methodology. The results show that the developed policymaking support methodology can be an effective tool to evaluate the acceptance of anti-pandemic policies from the public's perspective, to assess the balance between policies and people’s demands, and to further perform the response analysis of a series of policy adjustments based on online feedback.",0965-8564,Not found
Evaluation of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System scenarios for resilience in transportation using type-2 neutrosophic fuzzy VIKOR,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103666,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"There is a critical need for research in proactive and predictive management of the resilience of transportation systems implementing new technologies.

The analysis is based on a quasi-experimental design, which is applied to the Spanish case known as Madrid Central. Our results, which are quite robust to reasonable changes in the geographic areas used as controls, reveal an excess of scrapping decisions by vehicle owners in the city of Madrid following the implementation of this urban policy. This excess scrapping is transitory and particularly notable for old vehicles subject to major traffic restrictions. The results suggest that establishing a LEZ in a relatively small area can generate some social gains, in terms of transport safety and removal of the vehicles that pollute the most, which may outweigh the simple benefit of improving air quality in the area.",0965-8564,Not found
Intercity bus and rail services: Competition and welfare effects,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103660,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"We study the effects of the deregulation of intercity bus services in Europe on intermodal competition in long-distance land passenger transport and on social welfare. We consider a bus company with a flexible (Internet-based) business model and a rail operator with a rigid cost structure due to indivisibilities. We adjust the standard location model of horizontal differentiation to account for quality differences between modes, and for a bus capacity limit. We show that deregulation may turn the former rail monopoly on a route into a bus monopoly, particularly if bus quality is high enough and/or bus marginal cost is low enough. Since the bus is capacity constrained, then social welfare may be improved through a lump-sum transfer from bus to rail to restore competition and increase the number of travelers. Instead, we show that intermodal competition may reduce welfare (compared to rail monopoly) if the bus is inefficient and/or of low quality, so that bus services should be restricted by imposing quotas or even entry bans. Finally, we relax some assumptions and calibrate the model with data from the Genoa-Milan route in Italy. Numerical simulations confirm theoretical predictions and estimate annual welfare gains on the route under the compensation scheme.",0965-8564,Not found
The short-term impact of congestion taxes on ridesourcing demand and traffic congestion: Evidence from Chicago,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103661,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Ridesourcing is popular in many cities. Despite its theoretical benefits, a large body of studies have claimed that ridesourcing also brings negative externalities (e.g., inducing trips and aggravating traffic congestion). Therefore, many cities are planning to enact or have already enacted policies to regulate its use. However, these policies’ effectiveness or impact on ridesourcing demand and traffic congestion is uncertain. To this end, this study applies difference-in-differences (i.e., a regression-based causal inference approach) to empirically evaluate the effects of the congestion tax policy on ridesourcing demand and traffic congestion in Chicago. It shows that this congestion tax policy significantly curtails overall ridesourcing demand but marginally alleviates traffic congestion. The results are robust to the choice of time windows and data sets, additional control variables, alternative model specifications, alternative control groups, and alternative modeling approaches (i.e., regression discontinuity in time). Moreover, considerable heterogeneity exists. For example, the policy notably reduces ridesourcing demand with short travel distances, but such an impact is gradually attenuated as the distance increases.",0965-8564,Not found
Need-based approach for modeling multiday activity participation patterns and identifying the impact of activity/travel conditions,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103665,172,2023-06-01,2023,6,"People consume time and space given to them in order to participate in various activities, and the range of time and space that individuals can consume differs according to activity/travel conditions such as the working time, commuting time, the quality of transport infrastructure, etc. The accessibility toward opportunities to participate in these activities may have an impact on individual’s quality of life, and the accessibility to non-work activities has a larger impact than accessibility to mandatory activities. Therefore, the research objective of this paper was to examine how activity/travel conditions affected activity participation patterns. The mandatory activities that are not significantly affected by changes in activity/travel conditions were excluded from the research and the focus was on the changes in patterns of discretionary activities. To consider discretionary activity patterns with large day-to-day variability, multiday analysis was performed. For multiday analysis, the need-based theory suggested by prior studies was used as a theoretical background. To statistically analyze the need-based theory, a hazard-based duration model was utilized, and the general hazard-based duration model was extended to analyze the heterogeneity between latent classes. The time-use survey was conducted to collect multiday activity/travel diary data, and in order to relieve fatigue of survey respondents, the survey was simplified and conducted online. The results indicated that people's discretionary activity patterns are affected by various socio-demographic attributes, time budgets, and space budgets. In most of the activities, differences in activity patterns between the latent classes were identified. Furthermore, in this paper, the changes in activity patterns due to the opening of GTX-A (the express railway planned for the Seoul metropolitan area) were predicted using the model estimation results. Accordingly, it was found that as the GTX-A line opens and the time–space budget expands, the frequency of discretionary activities increases, i.e., induced demand occurs.",0965-8564,Not found

Purchase intention of Autonomous vehicles and industrial Policies: Evidence from a national survey in China,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103719,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In recent years, governments have successively introduced a variety of policies to promote the development of the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry and technology. Existing research sheds light on individuals’ decision process regarding their willingness to purchase AVs or legislation and policy design from the perspective of policymakers, regulators and experts. Little research has been conducted to explore what incentive policies consumers demand and how the policies affect their purchase intentions. In this study, a decision model of AV purchase intentions is proposed through a combination of the planned risk information seeking model (PRISM) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT), and the decision model is utilized to explore the mechanism of the influence of incentive policies on purchase intentions. The early stage of AV commercialization is the research background, and potential AV consumers are the research object. A national survey was conducted in China, and the empirical results indicate that consumers show higher risk perceptions of AVs and that they are most concerned about the unclear risk involved after the occurrence of traffic accidents by unattended cars. The perceived attractiveness of policies such as tax subsidy policies, insurance policies, and commute policies are all significantly and positively correlated with purchase intentions toward AVs. Rational industrial policies have significant effects on mitigating consumer risk perceptions and stimulating purchasing intentions.",0965-8564,Not found
A connectivity-based methodology for new air route identification,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103715,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"The change of routes at an airport has a huge impact on airlines’ revenue and city economy where the airport is located. Planning a successful route is a complicated decision-making process that involves considerations beyond the origin and destination. Past studies rarely consider how the addition of new routes or revision of existing routes affects the global aviation network and consequently impacts direct and transfer demands. A new data analytic approach is proposed to identify new and long-lasting routes and to assess connection quality from the global network perspective. It includes a comprehensive methodology for analysing the aviation network, evaluating potential route quality, deciding which routes warrant the selection, and estimating the long-and-short term traffic volume forecasts of the selected new routes. Seven attributes have been developed for route selection, covering growth, volume and connectivity-potential. Assessing connectivity potential permits the evaluation of the importance of a potential destination airport by considering the changes in competitive position that other airports connected to the same destination can expect when that new route is added to the network. This approach exploits the geographical relationships between airports and combines the network route supply data over a 9-year period to make assessment decisions on new destinations. A list of promising new destinations is created that can enhance the origin airport’s connectivity-potential and improve the competitive advantage of airports. Managerial implications are also proposed for different aviation stakeholders to facilitate their strategic planning on airport facility and capacity expansion, airline competition, multi-airport region collaboration and air service agreements.",0965-8564,Not found
Why do people take e-scooter trips? Insights on temporal and spatial usage patterns of detailed trip data,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103705,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Electric scooters (e-scooters) are becoming one of the most popular micromobility options in the United States. Although there is some evidence of increased mobility, reduced carbon emissions, replaced car trips, and associated public health benefits, there is little known about the patterns of e-scooter use. This study proposes a framework for high-resolution analysis of micromobility data based on temporal, spatial, and weather attributes. As a case study, we scrutinized more than one million e-scooter trips of Nashville, Tennessee, from September 1, 2018, to August 31, 2019. Weather data and land use data from the Nashville Travel Demand Model and scraping of Google Maps Point of Interest (POI) data complemented the trip data. The combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a K-means unsupervised machine learning algorithm identified five distinct e-scooter usage patterns, namely morning work/school, daytime short errand, social, nighttime entertainment district, and utilitarian trips. Among other findings, the most common use of e-scooters in Nashville was daytime short errand trips, contributing to 29% of all e-scooter trips. We found that 7% of all e-scooter trips resembled morning commuting to work or school. Only 16% of trips were classified as Nighttime Entertainment District trips. The average daily number of trips on a typical weekend was 81% higher than a typical weekday. We also found variation in e-scooter usage patterns over a year with high summer ridership patterns. The findings of this study can help city administrations, planners, and micromobility operators to understand when and where people are using e-scooters. Such knowledge can guide them in making data-driven decisions regarding safety, sustainability, and mode substitution of emerging micromobility.",0965-8564,https://github.com/niteshshah12/E-scooter-trip-pattern-analysis-of-Nasvhille
Comparing and contrasting choice model and machine learning techniques in the context of vehicle ownership decisions,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103727,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In recent years, planners have started considering Machine Learning (ML) techniques as an alternative to discrete choice models (CM). ML techniques are primarily data-driven and typically achieve better prediction accuracy compared to CM. However, it is hypothesized that since the ML techniques do not have the strong grounding to economic theory as the CMs, they may not perform well in contexts that are radically different from the ‘training’ scenario. It is also hypothesized that the relative prediction performance may be affected by the metrics used for comparing the models. This research aims to test these two hypotheses empirically by modelling vehicle ownership choices using household survey data from Dhaka, Bangladesh collected in 2004, 2010 and 2019. The performances of CM (multinomial logit) and ML techniques (neural networks and gradient boosting trees) have been compared using log-likelihood and mean absolute percentage error of market shares. The results indicate that the multinomial logit model (MNL) with a piecewise linear transformation of the household income, has the best performance in terms of log-likelihood and mean absolute percentage error of market shares. This is followed by Neural Networks (NN) and Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT). The results thus provide empirical evidence that the ML techniques do not consistently outperform CM. Moreover, the difference in the performance of the models further increases if the prediction scenario is substantially different. This reinforces the hypothesis that CMs, with their behavioural underpinning, are better suited for long-term forecasting than data-driven ML approaches, especially if the population and network attributes are expected to change substantially. These findings will be useful for planners and policy makers in the selection of the appropriate tool for forecasting travel demand.",0965-8564,Not found

Peer effect in the construction of China's high-speed rail stations: Empirical evidence from spatial econometric analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103720,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"The construction of China’s extensive high-speed rail (HSR) network is driven by various motives of different participants. This study employs an improved spatial econometric model to examine the motivation of local officials behind the construction of HSR stations. We employ a comprehensive dataset consisting of information about HSR station construction, the promotion of officials, the economic growth rate, etc., in 246 prefecture-level cities in China. The findings suggest that local officials are not making their decisions regarding HSR stations solely on conditions in their own cities. The construction of HSR stations is largely affected by the peer effect arising from geographic adjacency, economic adjacency and administrative adjacency. This is mainly because China’s local officials are engaged in the Promotion Tournament based on Yardstick Competition. Political promotion strengthens the peer effect. In addition, the fact that no directional learning between developed and underdeveloped cities reveals the severity of the peer effect in the construction of HSR stations.

Exploring key spatio-temporal features of crash risk hot spots on urban road network: A machine learning approach,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103717,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Traffic safety is a critical factor that has always been considered in policy making for urban transportation planning and management. Accurately predicting crash risk hot spots allows urban transportation agencies to better implement countermeasures towards enhancing traffic safety. Considerable efforts have been devoted to investigate crash risk hot spots in many previous studies. We hereby identify three research gaps that remain to be resolved: first, the effects of spatio-temporal features surrounding hot spots are often ignored; second, false discovery rates tend to be higher when applying local spatial indices to identify hot spots; and third, the spatio-temporal correlations and heterogeneity of crash-related features in a subject spot and its neighboring spots have not been well captured in most crash risk prediction models. To fill these gaps, we propose an urban crash risk identification model by integrating space-time cubes and machine learning techniques. The spatio-temporal correlations and heterogeneity of crash-related features are represented by using statistical descriptions of neighboring cubes. Three space-time cube risk datasets collected from Manhattan in New York City are used to validate the proposed model in the case study. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier is employed to predict the risk patterns (hot spots, normal spots, and cold spots) of each cube due to its satisfactory prediction performance. The validation results suggest that our proposed model attains lower false discovery rates and higher crash risk prediction accuracy as compared to conventional methods. As the results of the feature selection are empowered by machine learning, we found that most key features are inherent to the features of spatial neighboring cubes, which manifests the importance of considering the features of neighboring spots when identifying crash risk hot spots. Moreover, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are employed to interpret the effects of key features on hot spots, upon which the contributions of the features related to urban facilities, public transit, and land use are discussed. Based on the feature interpretation, several policy recommendations could be made to enhance urban road traffic safety in the future.",0965-8564,Not found
Analysis of the accessibility of connecting transport at High-speed rail stations from the perspective of departing passengers,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103714,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Accessibility assessment of High-speed rail (HSR) should not be limited to station-to-station analysis, since “first and last mile” transport is crucial. Economic costs, time value, and travel time volatility significantly impact travel decisions but are underexplored. We conducted a multidimensional analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the accessibility of HSR stations from the perspective of departing passengers. With data collected from the API of navigation software, measurement methods for static characteristics of accessibility, including time accessibility, economic accessibility, and generalized travel cost accessibility, and dynamic characteristics, were proposed. In terms of dynamic characteristics, the daily fluctuation and long-period fluctuation of travel time were quantified using coefficients of variation. The empirical analysis was carried out for three cities with different scales and transportation system compositions, which are Chengdu, Mianyang, and Leshan. Results reveal significant time and economic accessibility advantages for private and public transport, respectively. The time value at the equilibrium point of the generalized travel cost between the two modes is higher in larger cities, reflecting greater reliance on public connecting transport in metropolitan areas. Private transport has a greater accessibility advantage in the areas of the HSR station away from the core city, while public transport has a more prominent advantage in other cases. Negative correlation is observed between daily fluctuations and linear distance, with public transport exhibiting weaker but more extreme fluctuations. During peak hours, private transport displays greater volatility towards the core urban area. These findings have important policy implications for HSR station location decisions and the planning and operation of connecting transport.",0965-8564,Not found
Shipment size and vehicle choice modeling for road freight transport: A geographical perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103732,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Shipment size and freight transport mode choice have been modeled previously in many studies. There are several studies on the road transport level of this subject as well. This study investigates shipment size and road freight vehicle choice from a geographical point of view. An industrial region in a province may be neighboring another province, a large metropolitan area. Then, freight vehicle choice patterns in that industrial region may differ from the rest of the province it is part of. In this research, data were obtained from Kocaeli province in Türkiye. Modeling techniques include Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) for shipment size choice and Discrete Choice approaches for vehicle choice. This study investigates the effects of neighboring using dummy variable and market segmentation approaches. Both approaches show that one region of Kocaeli, neighboring Istanbul, has different vehicle choice mechanisms from the rest of Kocaeli. Therefore, in shipment size and freight vehicle choice modeling or freight transportation master plans for a region, neighboring effects of other large metropolitan areas should be considered. If necessary, separate models may be required for such regions. Effects of several variables on shipment size and vehicle choice patterns are also given.",0965-8564,Not found
What to do in response to toll increases: A behavioral analysis of freight carriers in New York State,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103725,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Freight carriers’ behavior greatly varies given the number of parties involved in the process from the origin end to the destination end and the heterogeneity of commodities. Accordingly, their reaction to transportation policies including road pricing is composed of multidimensional choices, e.g., they can take a series of actions in multiple stages in response to policies, which have been overlooked in the literature. To better understand carriers’ behavior, this paper investigated freight carriers’ behavior in reaction to toll increases in New York State using a stated preference survey. The following four reactions in response to hypothetical toll increase scenarios were jointly investigated: (a) passing on the costs to receivers; (b) reducing delivery frequency; (c) reducing travel distance on toll roads; and (d) changing time of day of travel. The descriptive analysis showed that reducing mileage on toll roads and passing on the costs are the two most preferred reactions while changing delivery time to avoid high toll is the least favorable reaction. A multivariate Probit model was also developed to quantitatively explore factors affecting the willingness to take the reactions. As a result, all the four reactions were positively correlated, suggesting that the reactions selected by carriers are complementary to each other. Factors (including commodity type and company size) affecting each reaction were investigated. Implications for planning and policymaking based on the results were also discussed.",0965-8564,Not found

Many transportation modes were severely impacted, including public transportation. During the early months of the pandemic in 2020, transit ridership dropped to unprecedented levels. Even by the end of 2022, bus ridership in the United States had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Despite the longstanding effects on public transportation, the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on bus ridership are largely unknown. In the context of this study, the direct impact refers to a change in travel behavior (i.e., due to the increased spread of COVID-19), while the indirect impact refers to reduced ridership due to factors such as lower employment or increased teleworking. This study proposes a framework to explore the drivers of transit ridership declines during COVID-19. The method is a multiple mediation analysis to estimate the monthly direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on bus ridership from March 2020 to December 2021. The results of this study revealed that three mediators (employment, telework, and people relocating) mediated about 13% to 38% of the total decline in bus ridership during the analysis period.

Cyclists perception and self-reported behaviour towards interacting with fully automated vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103713,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Fully automated vehicles (FAVs) have the potential to improve road safety and reduce traffic congestion and emissions. Most studies of acceptance of FAVs have focused on motor vehicle users, largely ignoring other road users, such as cyclists. This study investigates the factors that influence cyclists’ receptivity towards sharing roads with FAVs and their behavioural intentions in interactions with FAVs. The online survey collected information on participant demographics (e.g. age, gender, crash experience), self-reported on-road cycling behaviours (e.g. violations, errors, positive behaviours) and their receptivity towards sharing roads with FAVs (e.g. attitude, social norms, trust). Three typical cyclist-vehicle interaction scenarios were presented to test the cyclists’ intention to engage in self-protective behaviours (e.g. giving a hand signal, giving way or moving over) during the interaction with a FAV. Three hundred and fourteen Australian adults (106 females vs 208 males) who had ridden a bicycle at least once in the past year completed the survey. The results show that older cyclists and male cyclists had a lower receptivity towards sharing roads with FAVs than younger cyclists and female cyclists, respectively. Cyclists who reported being involved in a bicycle crash in the last two years and those who reported committing more errors on roads were more willing to share roads with FAVs. Cyclists who had a higher propensity to risky behaviours and positive behaviours were less likely to take intended self-protective behaviours during interaction with FAVs. Findings of the study provide some insights from the cyclist’s perspective to facilitate the development and implementation of automated vehicles.",0965-8564,Not found
Impacts of bus overtaking policies on the capacity of bus stops,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103702,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Long bus queues at busy stops plague bus systems in many cities. Since berths are laid-out in tandem, buses’ overtaking maneuvers are often prohibited or restricted, which can significantly reduce a bus stop’s discharge capacity. When overtaking is allowed, aggressive drivers may perform disruptive oblique insertion maneuvers that would undermine stop capacity and compromise safety. This paper develops parsimonious yet realistic simulation models to examine the impacts of different overtaking policies on bus-stop capacity. Key realistic features are considered, including the oblique insertions resulting from overtaking, impacts of a nearby traffic signal, and bus traffic characteristics (reaction and move-up times). Extensive numerical experiments unveil many new findings. Some are at odds with those reported by previous studies. In addition, we examine two strategies that can improve the stop capacity without incurring disruptive oblique insertions. Practical implications of our findings are discussed, especially on choosing the most productive overtaking policy and means to minimize the capacity lost to buses’ mutual blockage at stops. These implications have broad applications to various types of bus stops.",0965-8564,Not found

The thematic maps reveal the spatial clustering of areas with higher e-commerce activity but lower logistics facility coverage. It is worth noting that we do not observe logistics sprawl in the study region.

Do price reductions attract customers in urban public transport? A synthetic control approach,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103700,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"In this paper, we assess the demand effects of lower public transport fares in Geneva, an urban area in Switzerland. Considering a unique sample based on transport companies’ annual reports, we find that, when reducing the costs of annual season tickets, day tickets and hourly tickets (by up to 29%, 6% and 20%, respectively), demand increases by, on average, over five years, about 10.6%. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show how the synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003, Abadie et al., 2010) can be used to assess such (for policy-makers) important price reduction effects in urban public transport. Furthermore, we propose an aggregate metric that inherits changes in public transport supply (e.g., frequency increases) to assess these demand effects, namely passenger trips per vehicle kilometre. This metric helps us to isolate the impact of price reductions by ensuring that companies’ frequency increases do not affect estimators of interest. In addition, we show how to investigate the robustness of results in similar settings. Using a recent statistical method and a different study design, i.e., not blocking off supply changes as an alternate explanation of the effect, leads us to a lower bound of the effect, amounting to an increase of 3.7%. Finally, as far as we know, it is the first causal estimate of price reduction on urban public transport initiated by direct democracy.",0965-8564,Not found

In this paper, we examine the cost effects of bundling in the competitive tendering of highway pavement replacement with hot-mix asphalt. For this we use linear regression on data from a comprehensive sample of such contracts procured by the Swedish infrastructure manager (IM) during the 2012–2015 period. We find that bundling affects the procurer’s cost in multiple and partly counteracting ways. Our results show that economies of scale are strong but diminishing and counteracted by the costs of bundling and bundling-related factors. Overall, the findings support the Swedish IM’s current bundle design but also suggest that most of the contracts are still inefficiently small. While not perfectly generalizable to other markets, the findings provide some support for the increased promotion and use of the bundling of small-scale road rehabilitation projects in the USA. Two main implications of the results are that bundling policy should emphasize proximity and similarity rather than whether the work is small in scale and that the scope for efficient bundling should be accounted for when optimizing the timing of pavement replacement.",0965-8564,Not found

Give citizens a task: An innovative tool to compose policy bundles that reach the climate goal,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103694,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"We analyse the preferences of citizens with respect to climate policies in the transport sector. More specifically, we examine the citizens' preference for mixing different policies, the preferences for and determinants of different types of policy bundles, as well as the CO2 reduction achieved with these bundles. To this end, we developed an innovative evaluation tool, in which respondents could mix 11 different policies at various intensity levels according to their preferences with the (non-binding) goal to reduce CO2 emissions of passenger transport in Austria from currently 13.19 to 4.22 mill. tons/year. Respondents interactively received detailed information on ecological, financial and social effects of their policy selection, and could adjust their choice accordingly. We find that respondents display a widespread aversion against highly restrictive policies, but a preference for broad and well-balanced bundles between pull and push and also between different push policies. With these broad bundles, almost 60% of respondents met the ambitious climate goal. We speculate that this surprisingly high level of ambition may be driven by putting citizens into the role of a task solver (achieve the climate goal) instead of a mere choice maker of policies. Our analysis suggests that car affinity (strongly confounded with urban/non-urban residence), self-concern, political trust, the importance of solidarity and fairness, and (most of all) the climate concern determine the participants’ selection (or rejection) of effective policy bundles. The paper provides relevant insights for policymakers, both regarding participatory decision-making tools and acceptable policy bundles.",0965-8564,Not found
Are we getting close to truck electrification? U.S. truck fleet managers’ stated intentions to electrify their fleets,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103697,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Electrifying trucks can lead to large societal and private benefits for truck fleet managers. However, the electric truck market is still in its infancy compared to passenger electric vehicles. This study examines the intention of truck fleet managers/owners to electrify their fleets. A stated preference survey was designed and distributed online to truck fleet managers in the U.S., gathering 200 responses. This paper presents a descriptive analysis of the survey data, including information on the current and future market penetration of battery electric trucks. Additionally, using an ordered probit model with random parameters, this study identifies the factors affecting purchase intentions. The results showed that the purchase intentions of truck fleet managers are affected by three main groups of factors: trucking firm and truck fleet characteristics (such as trucking firm revenue and fleet size), opinions regarding electric trucks (such as cost to charge, perceived availability of charging infrastructure), and awareness of innovative charging technologies. Three factors related to the trucking segment, truck fleet composition, and truck annual mileage had mixed effects on truck fleet managers’ purchase intentions, that attests to the heterogeneity in truck fleet managers’ perspectives. This study contributes to the literature by providing significant insights regarding the perspectives of truck fleet managers in the U.S. and offering updated information on the electric truck market. Additionally, the study findings can be used by policymakers and other major stakeholders of the electric vehicle ecosystem to frame certain strategies to accelerate electric truck adoption.",0965-8564,Not found
How the design of Complete Streets affects mode choice: Understanding the behavioral responses to the level of traffic stress,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103698,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Following a federal policy statement in 2010 supporting bicycle and pedestrian accommodation in federal-aid transportation projects, many cities across the US have implemented Complete Streets principles and invested in developing better-planned infrastructure that can be safely accessed by a diversity of modes of transportation by all types of users, in a mix of land uses. However, most of the travel demand forecasting models and planning tools used in practice are not sensitive to changes in demand for non-motorized modes such as walking and cycling in response to road infrastructure improvements. Hence, there is a need for models and tools that are capable of evaluating impacts of infrastructure changes that include Complete Streets implementations on the travel behavior, and estimate shifts in mode choices from motorized to non-motorized modes. This paper proposes a specific data collection plan, a multi-modal choice model, and strategies to update traditional trip-based transportation models to forecast rates of non-motorized trips for evaluating Complete Streets plans at a higher level. Concretely, we estimate elasticities to Level of Traffic Stress, which defines the comfort or discomfort experienced by walkers and bikers, segmented by income levels and trip purposes. We then use them to compute the new non-motorized mode shares that would be achieved by improving CS attributes leading to lower levels of traffic stress. The proposed modeling framework has been successfully applied to the Maryland Statewide Transportation Model, producing reliable non-motorized trip rates, and can be extended to other methodological frameworks used by public agencies.",0965-8564,Not found
Future transport vision propensity segments: A latent class analysis of autonomous taxi market,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103699,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Autonomous vehicle (AV) is considered a promising mode of transport that has been tested and deployed in various cities worldwide. However, research on how AVs will transform the field of transportation has been hindered by the heavy reliance on attitude measurements and the need for responses from the public who can better represent the future. This study investigates the autonomous taxi market in Huangpu District, Guangzhou, China, where paid and publicly available autonomous taxi service has been in operation for more than a year. This study analyzes 1,158 responses from pioneering and prospective users of autonomous taxi service. Latent class analysis is used to segment autonomous taxi users into classes to reveal the differences in their views on the potential uses of AVs. This study identifies three latent classes: neutral and diverse travelers, conservative and strict travelers, and open and enjoying travelers. Results show that sociodemographic characteristics, household characteristics, and current travel behavior affect the class membership in various means. In addition, users’ perceptions of the benefits and risks of autonomous driving vary across different latent classes. Findings from this study will help improve the quality of autonomous taxi service by enabling customized service based on mobility propensities.

Influence of real and video-based experiences on stated acceptance of connected public transportation and autonomous vehicles in a transit mall: A hybrid choice modeling approach,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103695,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Innovative technologies such as autonomous and connected vehicles can create a better transit mall, a street where only public transit vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians are allowed. However, successful introduction of such technologies depends on user acceptance. To assess the potential acceptance of these technologies in the context of a new transit mall environment, it is crucial to provide an opportunity to experience them before they roll out. This study explores how real and video-based experiences of new technologies can affect public acceptance of new transit mall options in Hiroshima City, Japan, where trams and buses are significant modes of public transportation. We conducted a survey on the stated acceptance of new transit mall options with three groups of respondents: real experience, video-based experience, and no experience groups. The real-experience group self-selected themselves for the experiment, which potentially caused bias. Thus, we used a hybrid choice model with attitudinal variables (ethical, legal, and social concerns regarding emerging technologies, as well as risk-related factors) introduced to control for this bias. We found that both real and video-based experiences improved overall acceptance of new transit mall options, but there were differences in preferences between those who had only video-based experiences and those who had real experiences. We also found that prior knowledge of new transport services and infrastructure had a considerable influence on stated acceptance.",0965-8564,Not found
Investigating heterogeneous preferences for plug-in electric vehicles: Policy implications from different choice models,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103693,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) adoption has been a promising strategy to address climate change and improve energy security. Understanding consumer preferences for PEV attributes and policies is critical to accelerate mass PEV penetration. This study examines consumer preference heterogeneity in adopting PEVs with mixed logit (MXL), latent class (LC), and latent class-mixed logit (LC-MXL) models based on a stated preference survey in Virginia, U.S. Consistently, all three models indicate that providing a monetary incentive is most effective in increasing the overall PEV market share, followed by deploying more charging infrastructure, while improvement in battery range shows a weak impact. Furthermore, the choice models that capture preference heterogeneity provide more nuanced results on the effectiveness of policies on a specific consumer segment and for a specific vehicle powertrain type. Lastly, when considering various model evaluation measures (e.g., model fit, prediction accuracy, and behavioral interpretation), results show that no model is unanimously superior to the other models. Rather, altogether they uncover a more comprehensive picture of EV preference structure. Findings provide insights into the usefulness of each choice modeling framework for future PEV adoption research.

A holistic data-driven framework for developing a complete profile of bus passengers,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103692,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"User profiles, considered as one of the fundamental inputs of recommendation systems and customized services, can be rationally applied in the public transport domain to represent passengers’ characteristics and behavioral preferences. A user profile of a bus passenger, termed as a bus passenger profile (BPP), is an assortment of labels containing passengers’ travel features. This paper proposes a data-driven framework for developing BPP so as to provide guidance on how to create and estimate user profiles for bus passengers based on smart card data. The proposed method comprises three steps. (i) Data preprocessing aimed at extracting key information and preparing passenger profiling. (ii) A tag system aimed at storing the estimated travel features of passengers. (iii) Knowledge graphs aimed at connecting various BPP with semantic edges for practical application of prior knowledge in downstream tasks.

Scale effects in ridesplitting: A case study of the City of Chicago,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103690,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Ridesplitting – a type of ride-hailing in which riders share vehicles with other riders – has become a common travel mode in some major cities. This type of shared ride option is currently provided by transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber, Lyft, and Via and has attracted increasing numbers of users, particularly before the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous findings have suggested ridesplitting can lower travel costs and even lessen congestion by reducing the number of vehicles needed to move people. Recent studies have also posited that ridesplitting should experience positive feedback mechanisms in which the quality of the service would improve with the number of users. Specifically, these systems should benefit from economies of scale and increasing returns to scale. This paper demonstrates evidence of their existence using trip data reported by TNCs to the City of Chicago between January and September 2019. Specifically, it shows that increases in the number of riders requesting or authorizing shared trips during a given time period is associated with shorter trip detours, higher rates of riders being matched together, lower costs relative to non-shared trips, and higher willingness for riders to share trips.",0965-8564,https://github.com/UTEL-UIUC/Ridesharing-Scale-Effects

An acceptable level of service needs to be maintained in critical infrastructures, even in the case of disruptions. We develop an integrated model to assess the resilience of urban transportation networks when exposed to different disruptions. Resilience is evaluated from perspectives of both traffic network topology and traffic flow. This model contains three parts: (1) a traffic flow simulation model to get flow distributed throughout the whole network, (2) different real-world disruptions are abstracted as random, localized, and flood disturbances, (3) functional and topological resilience are accessed by analyzing variations in travel time and connected components before and after a disruption occurs. 40 major cities are chosen to conduct resilience assessments. As the intensity of the disruption increases, common trends in the changes of functional and topological resilience values are observed and analyzed across all studied cities. In most cases, flood disruption is the least disruptive one of all three types of disruptions. Regression models are developed to estimate functional and topological resilience after random, localized, and flood disturbances. Possible resilience enhancement strategies are discussed based on analyses of regression models. This study could aid stakeholders in gaining a clear understanding of resilience not only topologically but also from the perspective of traffic flow and offer them practical strategies to enhance resilience in face of disruptions.",0965-8564,Not found
Modular vehicle routing for combined passenger and freight transport,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103688,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"This study investigates the potential of modular vehicle concepts and consolidation to increase the efficiency of urban freight and passenger transport. Modularity is achieved by connecting multiple vehicles together to form a platoon. Consolidation is realized by integrating passenger and freight demand in the routing problem. Vehicles are specific for each demand type but can be connected freely, allowing the transport of multiple demand types in the same platoon. The routing problem formulation considers travel time costs, travel distance costs, fleet size costs, and unserved requests costs. The operations are modeled in a novel modular multi-purpose pickup and delivery problem (MMP-PDP) which is solved using CPLEX and Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS). In an extensive scenario study, the potential of the modular vehicle type is explored for different spatial and temporal demand distributions. A parameter study on vehicle capacity, vehicle range and platoon cost saving is performed to assess their influence on efficiency. The experiments indicate a cost saving of 48% due to modularity and an additional 9% due to consolidation. The reduction mainly stems from reduced operating costs and reduced trip duration, while the same number of requests can be served in all cases. Empty vehicle kilometers are reduced by more than 60% by consolidation and modularity. A large-scale case study in Stockholm highlights the practical applicability of the modular transport system. The proposed model and optimization framework can be used by companies and policy makers to identify required fleet sizes, optimal vehicle routes and cost savings due to different types of operation and vehicle technology.",0965-8564,Not found
Fixed routing or demand-responsive? Agent-based modelling of autonomous first and last mile services in light-rail systems,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103676,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"This paper examines the potential of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology for enhancing first and last mile services for a light-rail station. We use an event- and agent-based simulation model to compare the performance of fixed and demand-responsive routing services. The routing of on-demand services is based on a matching algorithm in which incoming passenger requests are prioritized and assigned to vehicles under capacity constraints. Our findings indicate that, for a high-frequency light-rail feeder system, fixed routing is the preferred option, even with the assumed reduction in operational costs due to driver-less operations. However, we also observe that demand-responsive services can be as effective as fixed routing in off-peak hours, provided the heuristics for matching passengers to vehicles are effective. This implies that a combination of the two services could be beneficial in certain contexts. In addition, our results demonstrate that urban sprawl has an impact on the performance of the system, with the demand-responsive services becoming relatively better when urban sprawl increases, while the fixed routing remains superior across most key-performance indicators. To assess the performance of the different services, we employ cost–benefit analysis.",0965-8564,Not found
Resilience towarded Digital Twins to improve the adaptability of transportation systems,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103686,173,2023-07-01,2023,7,"This work aims to investigate the role of the resilience of Digital Twins on the applicability of the transportation system. A literature study is conducted to review the current status of research on transportation systems and Digital Twins. It is found that the current research on Digital Twins technology has achieved different degrees of success in different aspects of transportation systems. Yet, the system performance of Digital Twins has to be optimized. First, the application of Digital Twins in intelligent transportation systems is analyzed. Then, how the changes in traveler behavior patterns reflect the extent to which the traffic network is affected by uncertain events is analyzed from the traveler's perspective. Finally, an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) system based on Digital Twins and blockchain is established to solve the data redundancy and high computational volume problems of in-vehicle data sharing common in the IoV system. Moreover, the performance of the twin system is optimized by proposing a multi-intelligence body algorithm based on local perception, and a case validation is performed. The results demonstrate that the adaptability of the transportation system to uncertain events and its response and recovery measures taken are reflected to some extent in the traveler behavior model. Besides, data sharing between vehicles and infrastructure in the transportation network can be well solved by Digital Twins Blockchain. The locally-aware multi-intelligent body algorithm saves more than 50% communication overhead and improves operational efficiency by nearly 20% over traditional algorithms by increasing intelligent body infrastructure units. It is adequately suited for large-scale vehicle traffic twins. It can be seen that improving the resilience of Digital Twins is a very obvious change in the adaptability of the traffic system.",0965-8564,Not found
"Work flexibly, travel more healthily? How telework and flextime affect active travel in Switzerland",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103748,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The impact of flexible working arrangements, such as telework and flextime, on daily travel demand is widely discussed. Although there is no evidence that flexible working arrangements reduce traffic in Switzerland, they still might be beneficial for the environment and public health if they are associated with more active travel (i.e. walking and cycling). Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of telework and flextime on various active travel patterns as well as possible benefits for public health. Most studies agree on a positive association between telework and active travel. However, these studies mostly rely on spatial flexibility (i.e. working remotely), and do not consider temporal flexibility (i.e. flextime). This study is the first to include different extents of working schedule flexibility in order to analyze active travel behavior. Active mode choices and travel durations are analyzed using the 2015 Swiss Mobility and Transport Microcensus (MTMC) – a nationwide representative micro-data travel survey. The results of this study indicate that telework is not associated with the likelihood of using active modes of transport overall; however, teleworkers walk and cycle more for leisure purposes as compared to on-site workers. Furthermore, the analyses show that flextime (particularly core time) users are more likely to use active modes of transport as compared to people who have a predetermined working schedule, which is mainly attributed to the fact that flextime users walk more. In order to indicate some health benefits, flexible working arrangements are analyzed concerning traveling actively for 30 minutes or more per day. This threshold refers to the recommendation of the World Health Organization concerning health-enhancing amounts of physical activity. The analyses reveal that telework and flextime (core time) are significantly associated with a health-enhancing amount of active travel. Another important finding of this study is that the Body Mass Index (BMI) and the weather condition should be included as control variables in studies that aim to analyze the direct effect of flexible working arrangements on active travel behavior. Overall, this study shows the importance of both spatial and temporal flexibility for choosing active modes of transport. The latter finding in particular is important for future research and policy decisions, as until now the impact of telework on active travel has been the main consideration, without recognizing flextime.",0965-8564,Not found
Predicting the future development scale of high-speed rail through the urban scaling law,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103755,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"High-speed rail (HSR) has become a significant mode of intercity travel due to its numerous socioeconomic and environmental benefits. Although some countries, such as China and Spain, have developed comprehensive HSR networks, many other nations are also investing or interested in developing their HSR infrastructure. However, concerns are arising about the high cost of HSR development and operation and whether the massive investment in HSR is justified. Furthermore, it remains unclear what HSR scale is appropriate to maintain travel demand and financial sustainability, considering the socioeconomic heterogeneity among different regions. To address this research gap, this study introduces a novel analytical framework that examines the relations between the scales of HSR and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, including the size of the urban population, using 294 Chinese cities as an example. By applying the machine learning method based on the theory of urban scaling law, we find that the existing scale of HSR varies considerably among different tiers of cities. Although some large cities have underutilized the scale of the HSR systems in terms of service frequencies, platforms and rail lines, others have overutilized it, especially in terms of the building area of HSR stations in Tier-1 cities. In addition, by comparing the predicted scale changes of HSR in 2035 and 2050 with the actual system planning documents, we confirm that while some cities’ (i.e., Shanghai and Shenzhen) predicted outcomes of system’s scale are consistent with that of the actual civic HSR development plans, inconsistencies are also found in other cities, such as Yangzhou and Wuhan. Overall, the study provides valuable empirical evidence and implications for policymakers to improve decision-making on the future HSR scale and guidance for future development.",0965-8564,Not found
Analyzing factors contributing to real-time train arrival delays using seemingly unrelated regression models,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103751,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Understanding the impact of various factors on train arrival delays is a prerequisite for effective railway traffic operating control and management. Existing studies analyze the train delay factors using a single, generic regression equation, restricting their capability in accounting for heterogeneous impacts of spatiotemporal factors on arrival delays as the train travels along its route. The paper proposes a set of equations conditional on the train location for analyzing train arrival delay factors at stations. We develop a seemingly unrelated regression equation (SURE) model to estimate the coefficients simultaneously while considering potential correlations between regression residuals caused by shared unobserved variables among equations. The railway data from 2017 to 2020 in Sweden are used to validate the proposed model and explore the effects of various factors on train arrival delays. The results confirm the necessity of developing a set of station-specific train arrival delay models to understand the heterogeneous impact of explanatory variables. The results show that the significant factors impacting train arrival delays are primarily train operations, including dwell times, running times, and operation delays from previous trains and upstream stations. The factors of the calendar, weather, and maintenance are also significant in impacting delays. Importantly, different train operating management strategies should be targeted at different stations since the impacts of these factors could vary depending on where the station is.",0965-8564,Not found
Improving the performance of headway control tools by using individual driving speed data,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103761,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Fleet control operation tools for high frequency bus service seek to maintain headway regularity between consecutive vehicles. Almost always, these tools suggest a series of control actions that must be executed by drivers that are assumed to be identical in their driving behavior and that this behavior is identical in all driving contexts. However, not all bus drivers drive in the same way and their behavior can be affected by different factors related to the environment in which they carry out their work. In this paper the behavioral difference is characterized by the average speed at which each of them drives along a given route. This work focuses on determining the impact of this heterogeneity on headway variability, and on how (erroneously) considering drivers to be homogeneous impacts the performance of headway regularity control tools based on holding decisions. The results show that the reduction in waiting times when the holding control strategy is applied compared to the case without control increases when speed variability across drivers also increases. We show that an easy way of improving headway regularity is to stratify drivers by line according to historical driving speed, regardless of whether or not a control action is applied.",0965-8564,Not found
Toward sustainable port-hinterland transportation: A holistic approach to design modal shift policy mixes,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103746,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Port-hinterland transport involves freight gathering and distribution between hinterland economies and ports. It is responsible for a major portion of the negative externalities of the entire port-related logistic chain. This study proposes an integrated model framework to facilitate the design of modal shift policy mixes to increase the sustainable performance of port-hinterland transport. The integrated model framework consists of three parts: (1) an econometric model to transform the hinterland economic scenarios into changes in port throughput, (2) a system dynamic model to estimate the changes in port-hinterland freight externalities due to changes in port throughput, and (3) a Monte Carlo simulation to identify those modal shift policy mixes with lower freight externalities. The proposed methodology is applied to Qingdao Port and its hinterland freight transport in China. The results show that hinterland economic growth will significantly raise port throughput and port-hinterland transport externalities. Four common modal shift policy instruments are considered, namely, internalization of external cost (IEC)-based pricing, road construction, increasing railway service level, and railway subsidy. The results show that the policy mix’s efficacy in reducing externalities increases with the increase in freight demand, but the holistic effect of the policy mix is lower than the sum of the effects of individual policies because these policies share the goal of facilitating modal shifts. The results of Monte Carlo simulations show that despite the uncertainty for hinterland economic prospects, the policy mixes with better performance in reducing externalities commonly include IEC-based pricing and increasing railway service level. The proposed methodology provides decision makers with a systematic framework for policy making toward sustainable port-hinterland transport.",0965-8564,Not found

That said, changes in out-of-home and in-home housework time for both household heads interact with each other: male heads are more likely to adjust their out-of-home housework due to self-commuting time changes; this, in turn, influences out-of-home housework participation among female heads.",0965-8564,Not found

We analyse such behaviour using a logit-based choice model based on revealed preference data collected from the smart card records and the operational timetables. The choice model considers waiting time, fluctuating crowding levels, and passengers’ expected seat availability at each station on their trip. The revealed preference data are collected based on an existing time component framework, which can estimate passengers’ itineraries by dividing passengers’ travel time into time components (i.e. access, egress, boarding delay, and transfer-walking times) and analysing their uncertainty. We improve the time component framework by developing methods for estimating distributions corresponding to each time component. Using Chengdu Metro as a case, we find that the extra waiting time resulting from active boarding delay and standing time is valued 50.5% more positively and 25.3% more negatively than the in-vehicle sitting time, respectively. By comparing our findings with studies focused on passive boarding delays caused by fully loaded trains, we suggest that extra waiting time due to active and passive boarding delays should be explicitly distinguished in practice. The estimation results of the distributions for the time components indicate that access and egress walking times follow different distributions at given stations, as opposed to the assumption in most prior studies.",0965-8564,https://github.com/chechezhe/IEUATMP

How does the state of bus operations influence passengers’ service satisfaction? A method considering the differences in passenger preferences,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103734,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Public transit (PT) is one of the most important choices for urban residents’ daily travel, and bus operation quality and passengers’ satisfaction are the key factors affecting the attractiveness of urban public transport.

By considering the diversity of requirements of the different passenger groups, this paper intends to characterize quantitatively the relationship between the operation and service of buses by correlating the bus operation data and service satisfaction questionnaire data. Structural equation modeling is deployed to quantitatively describe the relationship between the latent variables affecting quality perception and overall satisfaction. A Gaussian Mixture Model was established to classify bus passengers into four typical groups based on their travel purposes and individual characteristics. A random forest feature selection method was used to identify the core preference indicators of the four different groups. An “Operation–Service” relational impact model was established to explore the relationships between the bus operating status and service evaluation from the point of view of different passenger groups. The results show that operational efficiency has the greatest impact on passengers’ overall satisfaction. If the average transport speed could increase from 10 km/h to 15 km/h during the rush hours of the workday, the satisfaction scores increased for different groups. When the arrival time fluctuation of the bus is controlled to within 10 min, the satisfaction score for travel time reliability will increase by 122% among young commuting passengers. Some policy recommendations and strategies for specifically increasing passenger satisfaction were also proposed to encourage passengers to adopt a lower-carbon and environmentally friendly way of traveling.",0965-8564,Not found
Price versus Commitment: Managing the demand for off-peak train tickets in a field experiment,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103691,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Using data from a field experiment, we provide estimates for the own-price elasticity of train travel in Switzerland. Our estimates are based on exogenous changes to the level of discounts for long-distance trains and thus avoid the usual endogeneity problem between demand-dependent discounts. Besides the price, we also vary the gap between the early booking period and departure during the experiment, which allows us to recover the relative effectiveness of pricing and timing measures. We compute own-price elasticities of around −0.7. Ending the early booking period on midnight of the previous day rather than one hour before departure leads to a decrease in the sale of discount tickets by 18–30%, which is equivalent to a price increase by 26–43%. Last, we find that increasing the discount causes people to purchase their tickets at an earlier time, which allows us to quantify the value of commitment. Our results help design measures for peak-shifting in transport at least societal cost.",0965-8564,Not found
Consumer purchase intention of new energy vehicles with an extended technology acceptance model: The role of attitudinal ambivalence,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103742,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The mass diffusion of new energy vehicles (NEVs) in the automobile market depends largely on consumers’ acceptance behavior. In China, traditional culture induces attitudinal ambivalence in consumers’ purchase intention of NEVs. This study investigated the role of attitudinal ambivalence on consumers’ purchase intentions. An extended technology acceptance model (TAM) that incorporates attitudinal ambivalence is proposed. We conduct two sub-studies to verify the reliability of the proposed model by measuring subjective and objective attitudinal ambivalence respectively. The empirical results demonstrated that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived risk have a significant impact on the purchase intention of NEVs through the partial mediation of attitudinal ambivalence. Perceived risk and perceived ease of use have the strongest stimulating effect on attitudinal ambivalence and purchase intention respectively. Finally, we provide several managerial and policy implications for the advancement of NEVs.",0965-8564,Not found
Comparing municipal progress in implementing temporary cycle lanes during the Covid-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103752,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This study investigates whether the Covid-19 pandemic opened a policy window of opportunity for the implementation of temporary cycle lanes, and how German municipalities differed in their implementation progress. The Multiple Streams Framework is used to guide the data analysis and interpretation of the results. A survey of staff working in German municipalities is conducted. The extent to which municipal administrations progressed in the implementation of temporary cycle lanes is estimated using a Bayesian sequential logit model. Our results show that of the administrations who responded to the survey most did not consider implementing temporary cycle lanes. The Covid-19 pandemic positively affected implementation progress of temporary cycle lanes, but only the first implementation stage, which was the decision to consider implementing this type of measure.

Competition and welfare effects of introducing new products into the new energy vehicle market: Empirical evidence from Tesla's entry into the Chinese market,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103730,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Firms introduce new products as a critical competitive strategy. This strategy not only changes the competitive structure of the market, but also provides consumers with a broader range of choices. In this study, we collected sales data for new energy vehicles in six Chinese cities from 2020 to 2021 and used a random coefficient logit model to analyze the competitive and welfare effects of the introduction of Tesla on the Chinese new energy vehicle market. Our empirical findings suggest that consumers prefer electric vehicles that are affordable, have low energy consumption per 100 km, have a moderate range, and are large and heavy. The own- and cross-price elasticities of the vehicle brands show that although Tesla faces fierce competition from Chinese carmakers, it manages to capture a significant market share. In contrast, Chinese emerging brands, represented by the “new forces of car making,” also show strong competitiveness and dominating the market with differentiation strategies. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that the introduction of Tesla has a positive effect on consumer welfare by increasing the variety of electric vehicles available.",0965-8564,Not found
Congestion in cities: Can road capacity expansions provide a solution?,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103726,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Road network congestion; a traffic state characterised by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queuing; is a major issue in most urban areas around the globe. Building more roads is a commonly employed policy intervention to reduce congestion. This strategy, however, is controversial because under certain conditions road capacity expansions may induce growth in traffic volumes. A crucial precursor to understanding whether road capacity expansions provide a solution to congestion is to quantify the technology driving congestion in urban road networks. This congestion technology describes the variation in performance of the network, often represented by traffic flow through the road network, over its intensity of use given by the number of vehicles in the network. However, obtaining empirical estimates of congestion technology from data on traffic variables is challenging due to statistical biases that emerge via the complex interactions between traffic flow, traffic controls, and capacity. To adjust for such biases, this paper presents an approach based on causal statistical modelling to quantify the nature and form of congestion technology in road networks in twenty-four cities worldwide. Our results suggest that increasing network capacity is in general not an efficient solution to manage congestion, in the sense that the average travel speed in the network does not increase substantially with an increase in capacity. This result and our congestion technology estimates have important implications for optimal urban transportation strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
Substitutes or complements? Examining effects of urban rail transit on bus ridership using longitudinal city-level data,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103728,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Despite massive investments, bus ridership has constantly declined in many cities worldwide. As public transit systems are evolving from bus-based to mixed structured, the longitudinal interactions between bus and urban rail transit (URT) have attracted the growing attention of transportation planners in many cities. Based on complex network theory and minimum spanning tree method, we examine network and scale effects of rail transit on conventional bus. Fixed effect models (FEMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) are developed to identify non-linear causal effects of explanatory variables on bus transit ridership, rail transit ridership and total transit ridership, using China's city-level data during 2005–2020. The results showed when GDP per capita exceeded 75,000 yuan, residents would start switching away from bus; (2) for cities with advanced URT networks, simply improving bus service quality or constructing the rail network is not as effective as optimizing both together. Therefore, we recommend that for cities where the URT was less developed, financial resources need to be strategically invested in the bus transit networks so as to accommodate citizens' travel demand. Meanwhile, collaborative multimodal public transportation planning is essential for sustainable urban transportation development. The research outcomes may inform policymakers of the critical relationship between bus and rail transit and help create wise decisions on spending on public transit.",0965-8564,Not found
Digital navigation negates the economic benefits of road widening: The case of the M1 motorway,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103749,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Cost-benefit analysis of road investments involves models that generate travel time savings as the main economic benefit. Evaluation five years after opening of a scheme to widen a section of England’s M1 motorway between junctions 10 and 13 found that the traffic moved more slowly than before the scheme opened. Comparison was made with forecast flows generated by SATURN variable demand modelling and an associated economic model. Substantial net benefits to business users were forecast, whereas for non-business users time saving benefits were more than offset by increased vehicle operation costs, consistent with diversion of local trips to take advantage of the increase in capacity. There is reason to suppose that such diversion is facilitated by the wide adoption of Digital Navigation (known generally as satnav), which makes evident the fastest route choices, even at the expense of increased fuel costs. Diversion of local trips to utilise new strategic road capacity seems likely to be a general phenomenon, which detracts from the economic case for road investment. There is therefore a good case to treat the strategic road network as mature, focussing on improving operational efficiency and exploiting vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity in the form of Digital Navigation.",0965-8564,Not found
NET-RAT: Non-equilibrium traffic model based on risk allostasis theory,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103731,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Empirical studies of vehicle trajectories have shown that psychological theories of driver behaviour can shed light on car-following processes and the associated empirical traffic phenomena. Numerous continuum models have been derived from car-following relations in order to model macroscopic traffic flow dynamics through collective intercations between car-following processes. However, the existing continuum models cannot capture the psychological processes underlying drivers’ car-following in accordance to behavioural thoeries, and thus, have little implications for investigating empirical traffic phenomena in relation to human psychological factors. This paper develops a novel continuum model (Non-Equilibrium Traffic Model based on Risk Allostasis Theory, i.e., NET-RAT) from a car-following model, extended in this work, by incorporating drivers’ behavioural adaptions in relation to perceived risk. We first extend the full-velocity difference car-following model (FVDM) to incorporate drivers’ pereception of risk and its impacts on drivers’ adaptation time to frontal stimuli using car-following information (e.g., speed, spacing, etc) and corresponding safety surroage measures. Risk allostasis theory is used to model the impacts of perceived risk on drivers’ stimulus–response behavioural adaptation. We then derive NET-RAT by continuum approximations of the extended FVDM and the corresponding behavioural components. Theoretical investigations show that NET-RAT has desirable analytical properties regarding macroscopic traffic flow dynamics, and that such properties can also be explained meaningfully from a behavioural perspective. Furthermore, we investigate NET-RAT’s performance for real-world traffic by using data from the German A5 autobahn in order to study the impacts of drivers’ risk perception on the complex real-world traffic phenomena (e.g., wide scattering, traffic instabilities, hysteresis, etc.). The investigations show that NET-RAT can meaningfully capture such complex phenomena by linking them to the interplay between drivers’ dynamic adaption process in relation to their perceived car-following risk.",0965-8564,Not found
Location of transit-oriented development stations based on multimodal network equilibrium: Bi-level programming and paradoxes,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103729,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The unique relationship between the value capture mechanism (VCM) and transit-oriented development (TOD) stations and their peripheral areas, which progressively develops an expanded multimodal network, is well acknowledged in the transport industry. However, in regards to the location of TOD stations, insufficient attention has been paid to user travel behaviours and the operating mechanism of the multimodal network. To bridge this research gap, we develop a bi-level programming model for the location of TOD stations that analyses user travel behaviour in the multimodal network. The VCM and transit priority are the objectives of the upper level of this multi-objective optimization model. And the lower level of the model is a modified multimodal network equilibrium based on the Davidson function. Using a simple numerical simulation, this study proposes explanations for some traffic paradoxes from the perspective of a multimodal network equilibrium. We also illustrate competition and collaboration between rail and bus transport systems. Finally, this study uses an empirical case to describe the feasibility and applicability of the model. The results demonstrate that the location of TOD stations is not only one of the keys to the competitiveness of public transport but is also relevant to implementing its VCM.",0965-8564,Not found
Leveraging demand-capacity balancing to reduce air traffic emissions and improve overall network performance,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103716,174,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Improvements in European air traffic management (ATM) constitute one of the key levers to reduce aviation emissions in the future to reach ambitious goals. In this paper, we evaluate the benefits of improved network-centric ATM with coordinated optimisation of capacity, delays, re-routings and emissions vs the present fragmented ATM which has generated high delays and extensive re-routing due to sub-optimal capacity provision. In addition, we analyse the impact on flight efficiency of a novel trajectory-independent airport-pair charging scheme, which makes shortest routes the cheapest for Airspace Users (AUs), which is not always the case with the current charging scheme in Europe. We test and evaluate proposed changes in ATM using a case study based on real data covering 3,000–4,000 flights in large parts of Western European airspace. We find that network-centric ATM can reduce variable costs borne by AUs by 21% and in particular re-routing cost (and associated emissions) by almost 64%. Furthermore, airport-pair charging can save almost 11% of costs for AUs and up to 320,000 tons of CO 2 emissions — if accompanied by adequate capacity changes that reflect the shift in demand towards shorter trajectories. We conclude that various stakeholder initiatives to reduce the fragmentation in European ATM and to move towards a more network-centric approach have merits and should be pursued by the policy makers.",0965-8564,Not found
Capacity characteristics of long-term work zones on signalized intersection approaches,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103791,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This study explored the capacity characteristics of five long-term WZ configurations at a major signalized intersection in Toronto. In total, 1,766 cycles and 22,057 inter-vehicle headway observations were recorded using over 140 h of real-time traffic videos. The saturation flow rate ranged from 1318.7 to 1767.3 pc/hr/ln across the study sites. Interestingly, the Highway Capacity Manual WZ model was found to significantly overestimate the traffic capacity at the study sites. The analysis assessed the hypothesis that the saturation headway is further compressed when long queues are present on site. The average saturation headway during oversaturated conditions was found to be shorter by 5 to 11% across the study sites as compared to undersaturated conditions. Other influential factors such as day versus night and late-merge were assessed. The saturation flow under daytime conditions was higher by 3 to 5% as compared to nighttimes. Vehicles merging late from the closed lanes had a shorter headway as compared to vehicles approaching from the open lane by around 8 to 10%. Probability distribution functions of the saturation headway were developed, the best-fit curve for all cases was found to be the three-parameter lognormal distribution. The study also developed multiple regression equations to estimate WZ capacity reduction induced by heavy vehicles for a wide range of heavy vehicle percentages. On average, oversaturated conditions yielded a 5.4% additional flow reduction as compared to undersaturated conditions for the same HV%. Moreover, the impact of different snow conditions on the saturation flow was estimated. The fully slushy, partly slushy, and bare-and-wet snow categories resulted in headway elongation of 35.1 to 42%, 21.2 to 23.4%, and 6.2 to 12.6%, respectively. The study explains how the findings can assist transportation agencies and practitioners in improving the policies, practices, and guidelines related to WZ activities and planning.",0965-8564,Not found

The accessibility measure is derived from an activity-based demand model formulated as a Markov decision process in a dynamic discrete choice framework, where space–time constraints affect the possibilities of individuals to engage in activities during spare time. Indeed, the results show that spare time accessibility is significantly linked to workplace accessibility.

For both partners, acquiring a household car significantly increased car use, and disposing of household cars decreased car use frequency. The number of household cars was inversely related to men’s train use. Childbirth in the household decreased both partners’ cycling frequency. Men’s job changes increased train use.

Analysis of links between dockless bikeshare and metro trips in Beijing,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103784,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"In this study, we examine the factors associated with the integrated use of dockless bikesharing (DBS) and metros. Special attention is paid to the nonlinear effects of these factors, using machine learning; in this case, a random forest model and accumulated local effects (ALE) plots. We measure the integrated use of DBS and metros based on DBS data and metro smart card data in Beijing. Explanatory variables include metro station characteristics, road infrastructure, public transportation services, land use, and urban density, as well as meteorological variables. We find that metro ridership and DBS density around service areas are the most crucial factors for promoting cycling access/ egress near metro stations. After reaching the thresholds of 6,000 trips for metro ridership and 200 bikes/ per km2 for DBS density, notable joint effects are evident between the two variables, which are negative in egress trips but positive in access trips. Bicycle parking and bus transfer distance and their connectivity to metro stations are important for integrated use. We find that buses will be less competitive when exceeding 25 lines per station. Population density has a nonlinear effect, with a positive association below 9,000 persons/ km2 and a decreasing effect above this level. The land-use mix index was also found to be negatively associated with integrated use, and bicycle lanes are not associated with integrated use. Our results demonstrate that public transit service planning should consider the constraints of resources and public space, and we provide recommendations for governments and stakeholders to reallocate DBS and other public transit services around metro stations.",0965-8564,Not found
Spatial-temporal heterogeneity and built environment nonlinearity in inconsiderate parking of dockless bike-sharing,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103789,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Although previous studies have shed light on the travel behaviour of dockless bike-sharing (DBS) users, little research focused on their inconsiderate parking behavior. Unlike the travelling behavior, the choice of parking location is closely linked to the different built environments surrounding the parking locations. Therefore, to improve the efficiency of governance, it is vital to explore the parking patterns and heterogeneous influences of the built environment on inconsiderate parking and formulate targeted measures. This paper measures the coordinates of prohibited parking areas in the field to identify inconsiderate parking. Based on big data from Mobike DBS and data on the built environment, the paper empirically analyzes the heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution patterns of inconsiderate parking with clustering and decision trees. The influencing factors of inconsiderate parking and their nonlinear effects are further analyzed using random forest and partial dependence plots (PDP). The results show that there is significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in inconsiderate parking, in which different clusters reflect various characteristics of the built environment. Furthermore, marginal effect analysis finds that influencing factors such as riding distance, catering service places, lifestyle services, sports and leisure places, and hotels and hostels have a strong effect on inconsiderate parking behavior, and show nonlinear effects with optimal allocation intervals. Therefore, targeted strategies should be carried out in terms of dynamic temporal adjustment, precise spatial layout, differential management according to time and zone, and cause-assisted administration.

Defining and implementing a sufficient level of accessibility: What's stopping us?,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103792,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Recent transport equity literature has proposed a sufficientarian approach to transport planning, according to which all individuals would be entitled to a minimum level of accessibility deemed adequate or sufficient. The implementation of this approach would require the adoption of an accessibility standard as a key performance indicator guiding transport investments, land use planning and service provision. While accessibility measures are increasingly operationalised in professional practice, the adoption of actual accessibility standards is rare. In this paper, we explore the barriers for adopting explicit accessibility standards and identify conditions within which such standards could be acceptable to practitioners and policymakers. The paper draws on interviews with professionals in three city-regions in Sweden, complemented with interviews with practitioners from the Flanders region in Belgium and from the UK. We find that authorities are hesitant to define and measure accessibility and that where definitions and performance indicators exist, there is a lack of agreement within and across authorities. The prospect of introducing a standard across the board without attaching any conditions comprises a further reason for shying away from standard-setting. The (dis)integration of transport and land use and complicated administrative and governance structures are described as a further barrier, while demand responsive transport is in some cases considered a panacea to all accessibility problems, making it possible to avoid setting standards. Our findings suggest that standards for minimum accessibility could gain political support if their reach is clearly circumscribed, and their benefits are clearly understood.",0965-8564,Not found
Transit-induced commercial gentrification: Causal inference through a difference-in-differences analysis of business microdata,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103758,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"A plethora of studies has explored the relationship between transit investments and property prices, but very little is known about how new transit projects and transit-oriented development affect nearby businesses and whether they contribute to commercial gentrification. This research presents a quasi-experimental econometric framework for studying transit-induced commercial gentrification from project announcement to post operation using business microdata. Previous urban economics and planning research informs the identification of retail and service business categories associated with the phenomenon of commercial gentrification, including local businesses, chain stores, and businesses offering non-essential or upscale products. Negative binomial models with a difference-in-differences specification enable the temporal and spatiotemporal analysis of business entries, exits, and turnover and the estimation of transit-induced impacts.

Promoting service quality with incentive contracts in rural bus integrated passenger-freight service,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103781,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"A rural bus integrating passenger and freight transport is a new effective public transit mode to realise village interconnection and solve the first–last mile rural logistics service. Mixed services reduce logistics costs and generate additional income for transit operators. However, the mutual interpenetration of logistics and passenger services in a single bus trip may lead to a decline in the service quality of both passengers and goods. With this in mind, we designed a government subsidy incentive contract and a logistics alliance payment incentive contract respectively from the perspective of participants based on the principal-agent theory. In addition, a bi-level programming model consisting of two principals (government and logistics alliance) and one agent (transit operator) was proposed to incentivise bus operators and improve passenger and freight service quality. It scientifically realises the coordination of interests between the principals and agents. A Chinese case study was conducted to examine the proposed models and methods, and a passenger-based incentive subsidy programme from the government was proposed to replace the mileage-based one. With both incentive policies (government and logistics alliance), passenger travel time can be reduced by 4.2 min, and logistics transportation time can be shortened by 30 min. In addition, the total annual government budget can be reduced by 17.2% (¥450,000, $64,000) and annual fleet mileage savings by approximately 9.4% (62,000 km) compared with the mileage-based incentive programme in the case study.

Understanding changes in travel patterns during the COVID-19 outbreak in the three major metropolitan areas of Japan,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103762,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Unlike the lockdown measures taken in some countries or cities during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Japanese government declared a “State of Emergency” (SOE) under which people were only requested to reduce their contact with other people by at least 70%, while some local governments also implemented their own mobility-reduction measures that had no legal basis. The effects of these measures are still unclear. Thus, in this study, we investigate changes in travel patterns in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and related policy measures in Japan using longitudinal aggregated mobile phone data. Specifically, we consider daily travel patterns as networks and analyze their structural changes by applying a framework for analyzing temporal networks used in network science. The cluster analysis with the network similarity measures across different dates showed that there are six main types of mobility patterns in the three major metropolitan areas of Japan: (I) weekends and holidays prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, (II) weekdays prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, (III) weekends and holidays before and after the SOE, (IV) weekdays before and after the SOE, (V) weekends and holidays during the SOE, and (VI) weekdays during the SOE. It was also found that travel patterns might have started to change from March 2020, when most schools were closed, and that the mobility patterns after the SOE returned to those prior to the SOE. Interestingly, we found that after the lifting of the SOE, travel patterns remained similar to those during the SOE for a few days, suggesting the possibility that self-restraint continued after the lifting of the SOE. Moreover, in the case of the Nagoya metropolitan area, we found that people voluntarily changed their travel patterns when the number of cases increased.",0965-8564,Not found

We then construct a programming model to optimize a Japan-Europe, sea-rail transportation corridor in terms of ship size and sailing speed, operating frequency for Japan-China short-sea liner shipping and the needed CR-Express trains, with the objective of maximizing transportation profits from the multimodal system. Our model demonstrates that Japan’s high value exports to Europe prefer the multimodal route. In addition, three ships of 500 TEU each, with a sailing speed of 21 knots and departing 3 times per week, should be used for the short-sea liner leg of the route. We project the realized benefit at 2.0807 million USD/week (equivalent to 108.19 million USD annually). In the optimal case, 3 CR-Express trains with available capacity of 69 TEU containers will be necessary to connect the short-sea liner ships to the overland route.",0965-8564,Not found

Public policy recommendations based on a comprehensive understanding of HSR operations are rarely found in the literature. The current study develops a System Dynamics (SD) simulation model that formally structures the complex non-linear interactions between HSR stakeholders' management decisions and their impact on passenger ridership. The SD model is calibrated with actual operational data from the Taiwanese HSR. Simulations are implemented to observe how endogenous linkages between pricing, seat availability, maintenance, and service quality impact HSR ridership across lifecycle phases. The results provide a basis for considering important implications for relevant HSR stakeholders by revealing how simplistic strategies for managing HSR projects, not based on a complex system perspective, can lead to suboptimal results for long-term system performance. In particular, the study illustrates a mechanism for efficient HSR management through a balance between Market Saturation and Word-of-Mouth effects, with the need to increase the number of passengers willing to adopt HSR. As HSR operators alone are constrained in affecting many strategies generated by the model, the study also highlights the need for flexible but targeted coordination between public and private HSR stakeholders throughout different lifecycle phases of HSR operations. Such coordination should focus on promotional activities during the early operation stages and implementing pricing and service availability adjustments to respond differently to market penetration and demand expansion phases.",0965-8564,Not found
Income allocation and distribution along with high-speed rail development in China,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103767,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Previous studies have extensively examined the role of high-speed railways in economic growth from the view of economic geography but have largely overlooked their contribution as technological progress to wages and private savings. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing the association between high-speed rail, wages and private deposits in 284 Chinese prefectural-level cities from 2003 to 2018. Utilizing a difference-in-difference method and conducting robustness tests, we examine three potential mechanism channels in this association. Our findings reveal that the introduction of high-speed rail new stations has significantly boosted wage levels through employment effects and financial development effects. However, the opening of the new stations has led to a decrease in private savings. This can be attributed to the marginal absorption of increased wages by higher consumption levels facilitated by high-speed rail development. Additionally, high-speed rail development stimulates private capital investments growth in financial markets. In essence, the technological progress represented by high-speed rail alters residents' traditional investment behavior. Our finding suggests strong heterogeneity across regions and significant siphon effects across cities. This paper offers insights into the balanced development of wages and private deposits in China, highlighting the implications of high-speed rail for economic dynamics in the country.",0965-8564,Not found
Enablers for maritime supply chain resilience during pandemic: An integrated MCDM approach,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103777,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Maritime transport is responsible for carrying over 80% of the world's goods, making it the backbone of the global economy. The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruptions to supply chains, underscoring the critical need for resilience. However, there is no clear definition of customer-oriented maritime supply chain resilience (MSCR) during pandemic. This study proposes a definition of MSCR in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the needs of customers (i.e., freight service continuity and freight rate stability). The study aims to investigate the hierarchical and causal relationships among MSCR enablers and classify them into driving and dependence power, using an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that combines Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM), fuzzy Matriced Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement (MICMAC), and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL). A total of eighteen MSCR enablers during the pandemic are identified through literature review and experts’ opinions. The results of the study manifest that the most influential enabler is the redundancy plan, while freight service continuity and freight rate stability are determined to be the most significant and resultant enablers. The proposed approach has the potential to assist decision-makers in identifying the critical factors that require focused attention to enhance MSCR in the future.",0965-8564,Not found
Examining the impacts of capital investment in London's Underground: A long-term analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103744,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"The deferred repair of infrastructure is often a pressing issue since infrastructure failures can have severe economic consequences for both operators and users. Although the benefits of non-expansion capital spending are well-known within the industry, empirical validations of such benefits from an organisational perspective are relatively rare. This exploratory research seeks to understand the impact of non-expansion capital spending on demand-side measures and operating cost using 70 years of unique data from London Underground. The data was collected for this research, and is among the longest time series for metros available within the academic literature. We adopt an autoregressive distributed lag model and discuss implications in the context of industry practices, including analysis of the company’s history and London’s urban development and politics. The exploratory results suggest that a 10% annual growth in cumulative non-expansion capital spending is associated with, on average, 4%–5% annual growth in passenger demand. Additionally, investment’s overall impact on demand increases over time. The 2000s period of infrastructure public–private partnerships was also found to be associated with positive annual growth in operating cost and negative growth in passenger demand. These results highlight the importance of capital investment and the impact of local politics on rail organisations’ long-term financial health.",0965-8564,Not found
Are seniors in mountainous areas able to realize their desired trips? A novel approach to estimate trip demand,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103776,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Public transport services in mountainous areas are limited, and seniors living in such areas experience various inconveniences in their daily lives. Therefore, the planning of adequate services is crucial in improving the quality of life. Conventionally, public transport services are planned based on observed trip demands, which are referred to as realized trip demands in this study. However, this approach is inadequate because seniors living in an area with insufficient public transport services are generally unable to realize all their desired trips. This study proposes a model to predict the desired trip demand based on the analysis of the travel conditions of seniors in mountainous areas. The proposed model predicts the desired trip demands based on both the realized and unrealized trip demands. The bivariate Poisson regression model is applied to the distribution of desired trip demands and mobility constraints, and the joint probability model, which considers the relationship between them, is proposed. Additionally, in the case where respondents are unable to report the unrealized trip demands accurately, an alternative method is implemented to estimate the desired trip demand based only on the information on whether unrealized trip demand exists, and its estimation results are discussed. The analysis results demonstrate that the conventional trip demand model, established using realized trip demands, underestimates the trip demand in the target area and show that the estimated parameters are biased. The conventional trip demand model neglects 30–50% of trip demands in the target area and cannot provide the trip demand required for appropriate transportation planning. The reproducibility of the desired trip demands can be further improved by extending the model to consider overdispersion or the case where unrealized trip demands have a large share of zero trips or both.",0965-8564,Not found
LWR and shockwave analysis - Failures under a concave fundamental diagram and unexpected induced disturbances,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103766,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This paper undertakes a detailed empirical study of traffic dynamics on a freeway. The results show the traffic dynamics that systematically determine the shape of the fundamental diagram, FD, can also violate the stationarity assumptions of both shockwave analysis and Lighthill, Whitham and Richard's models, thereby inhibiting the applicability of these classical macroscopic traffic flow theories. The outcome is challenging because there is no way to identify the problem using only the macroscopic detector data. The research examines conditions local to vehicle detector stations to establish the FD while the single vehicle passage method is used to analyze the composition of vehicles underlying the aggregate samples. Then, traffic states are correlated between successive stations to measure the actual signal velocities and show they are inconsistent with the classical theories. This analysis also revealed that conditions in one lane can induce signals in another lane. Rather than exhibiting a single signal passing a given point in time and space, the induced and intrinsic signals are superimposed on one another in the given lane. We suspect the subtle dynamics revealed in this research have gone unnoticed because they are far below the resolution of conventional traffic monitoring. The findings could have implications to other traffic flow models that rely on the FD, so care should be taken to assess if a given model is potentially sensitive to the non-stationary dynamics presented herein. The results have a direct impact on practice. Traffic flow theory is a critical input to many aspects of surface transportation, e.g., traffic management, traffic control, network design, vehicle routing, traveler information, and transportation planning all depend on models or simulation software that are based upon traffic flow theory. If the underlying traffic flow theory is flawed it puts the higher level applications at risk. So, the findings in this paper should lead to caution in accepting the predictions from traffic flow models and simulation software when the traffic exhibits a concave FD.",0965-8564,Not found
An analysis on the resilience of the European port network,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103778,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Resilience measures based on topological indices from graph theory are proposed to measure three essential aspects of the network resilience, namely connection extent measured by the extent of nodal connection, connection efficiency measured by the connection time aspect, and connection scale measured by service capacity aspect. Real liner service data are utilized to capture the intrinsic structure of the intra-Europe port network and measure its resilience against three potential “attack strategies”. We conclude that the intra-Europe network has a low resiliency towards potential port disruptions as it relies heavily on a few large ports, and is highly sensitive to the easiest human-led attack strategy or a regional natural disaster surrounding the German port region. Also, Piraeus port is found to hold a critical role in the network connection. Another interesting port is Bremerhaven which provides unique connections to many small ports in the network.

Breaking down public transit travel time for more accurate transport equity policies: A trip component approach,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103756,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"In the Northern hemisphere, low-income transit users typically take shorter trips and use buses in a greater proportion, but there is limited knowledge on inequalities in the detailed characteristics of public transit trips. In this paper, we seek to understand and explain differences in segment components of transit trips across socio-economic groups. Trip components include access time, wait time, total travel time, overall trip speed and percent of trip time spent in access and wait (off-vehicle time). Using the Montreal metropolitan region travel survey (2013), we focus on the 46,186 transit trips made by 20,138 individuals for which household income was available. This data is augmented by time estimations of the aforementioned trip components, and combined with trips specific transit service measures calculated using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). We first assess the relationship between trip components and income using descriptive statistics. OLS regressions are then conducted to identify which individual and transport-based factors contribute to variations in trip component outcomes. Low-income transit users take more transit trips (especially bus and Metro) than their higher income counterparts and combine multiple transit modes through more frequent transfers. While average access and wait time are individually lower than those for trips of wealthier respondents, low-income total trip time is similar but trip speed is considerably lower. Lower-income populations also spend a greater share of their trips in access and wait time due to service and trip discrepancies including trip timing, proximity to metro stations and requirement for transfers. When controlling for other factors, the conditions under which trips by low-income individuals are taken mainly drive income differences.",0965-8564,Not found
The impacts of automated vehicles on Center city parking,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103764,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"The potential for automated vehicles (AVs) to reduce parking in central cities has generated much excitement among urban planners. AVs could drop-off (DO), and pick-up (PU) passengers in areas where parking costs are high: personal AVs could return home or park in less expensive locations, and shared AVs could serve other passengers. Reduced on-street and off-street parking present numerous opportuni- ties for redevelopment that could improve the livability of cities, for example, more street and sidewalk space for pedestrian and bicycle travel. However, reduced de- mand for parking would be accompanied by increased demand for curbside DO/PU space with related movements to enter and exit the flow of traffic. This change could be particularly challenging for traffic flows in downtown urban areas during peak hours, where high volumes of DOs and PUs are likely to occur. Only limited research examines the travel effects of a shift from parking to DO/PU travel and the impact of changes in parking supply. Our study uses a microscopic road traffic model with local travel activity data to simulate personal AV parking scenarios in San Francisco’s downtown central business district (CBD). In these scenarios, we vary (1) the demand for DO and PU travel versus parking, (2) the supply of on-street and off-street parking, and (3) the total demand for parking and DO/PU travel due to an increase in the cost to travel to the CBD.",0965-8564,Not found
A flexible and scalable single-level framework for OD matrix inference using IoT data,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103775,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This study proposes a flexible and scalable single-level framework for origin–destination matrix (ODM) inference using data from IoT (Internet of Things) and other sources. The framework allows the analyst to integrate information from multiple data sources, while controlling for differences in data quality across sources. We assess the effectiveness of the framework through a real-world experiment in Greater Adelaide (GA), Australia. We infer car OD flows within the region using four separate data sources: site-level traffic counts from loop detectors, vehicle trajectories recorded by roadside Bluetooth sensors, partial OD flows based on data from in to vehicle navigation systems, and journey-to-work OD data collected by the Australian Census. We compare our OD inferences with those from the current version of the Strategic Adelaide Model (SAM), calibrated using data from traditional household travel surveys. We find remarkable consistency between our inferences and those from SAM, despite differences in input data and methodologies. For example, for the morning peak period, we predict the total number of trips made within GA to be equal to 556,000, while the corresponding prediction from SAM is equal to 484,000. The two predictions are within 15 per cent of each other. When we compare the spatial distribution of trips, in terms of origins and destinations, we find that our inferred OD matrix has an 86 per cent cosine similarity to the corresponding SAM matrix. Travel time predictions based on our OD inferences correspond closely to those predicted by the Google Directions API, lending further confidence in our inferences. In summary, our results show that the proposed framework can produce highly comparable ODM, trip production and trip attraction patterns to those inferred from traditional household travel survey-based transportation demand modelling methods.",0965-8564,Not found
An equilibrium approach for compensating public–private partnership concessionaires for reduced tolls during roadway maintenance,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103759,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This study considers the possibility of exploiting excess capacity along concurrent tolled roadway facilities operating in a public–private partnership for the purpose of alleviating traffic congestion during improvement action execution on a public roadway facility. Increased access to the tolled facility is enabled by reducing or suspending tolls during periods of roadway improvement action and appropriately compensating the tolled facility concessionaire for expected losses. The problem of determining an optimal reduced toll pricing strategy and compensation level is referred to as the Maintenance Timing and Price Discovery (MTPD) problem. A multi-level optimization model and iterative solution method are proposed to solve this problem. As toll prices often depend on traffic levels, the model also determines the optimal timing and time-of-day and day-of-week for executing the set of required improvement actions over the planning horizon to ensure a lowest total cost. The multi-level model consists of two bilevel models. Solution of the greater model is attained at a Stackelberg equilibrium between these two bilevel models. An additional Stackelberg equilibrium is sought between upper and lower levels of each of these two bilevel models individually. The MTPD formulation and general solution methodology are applied on an illustrative example from which computational results are obtained. Insights from the results show that this strategy for alleviating traffic congestion during roadway maintenance or other improvement activities can lead to substantial savings in total agency and user costs.",0965-8564,Not found
Charging electric vehicles on long trips and the willingness to pay to reduce waiting for charging.

This research contributes to existing literature by estimating the willingness to pay for reducing waiting time for charging, as well as understanding the role of explanatory variables in influencing decisions about charging at public charging stations on long trips. Responses from a stated preference (SP) survey in Norway in 2021 were analysed with a mixed logit model. Results showed that price, waiting time, charging speed and facilities were significant variables for station characteristics, while for trip features, the distance to destination and remaining range, also play a significant role.

Moreover, it is far from certain that everyone responds to the environment in the same way. In this paper, I examine whether responses to the walkability of the built environment differ between individuals with stronger and weaker preferences for active travel modes. I identify weaker preferences for active modes by using data on movement impairments and show that these individuals do not respond to walkability as strongly as those with stronger preferences.

Where to park an autonomous vehicle?

However, little knowledge is gained on how people will choose to park their autonomous cars. In principle, an autonomous vehicle is not necessarily parked close by like traditional vehicles leveraging the automated driving and parking capability, still, the decision made by people is important for policymakers in urban and transportation planning. This study attempts to gain useful insights to understand people’s parking location choices for autonomous vehicles. A stated choice experiment was designed, allowing people to choose a parking location for autonomous vehicles in varied contexts, including time windows, picking-up times, and the requirement for on-time arrival at the next activity. We found that similar to conventional cars people generally prefer cheaper and/or closer parking lots for autonomous vehicles. However, the distance between a parking lot and the activity location is relatively longer in the case of autonomous vehicles. The amount of time an autonomous vehicle spends in congestion while picking up the users influences the choice of parking locations. Moreover, substantial preference heterogeneity between individual people was found in the parking choice behavior. The maximum value of access time for autonomous cars is 34 $/h which is higher than the empirical value of walking time for conventional cars. Results of elasticity indicate that the influence of parking fees is larger than that of access time and congestion time.",0965-8564,Not found
How does “over-hype” lead to public misconceptions about autonomous vehicles? A new insight applying causal inference,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103757,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Traffic accidents caused by drivers’ over-reliance on SAE L2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have become a new type of accident worthy of attention. There is growing concern that the “over-hype” about automation technology produced by manufacturers or the media might affect the formation of public misconceptions about autonomous vehicles (AVs), further influencing their unsafe interaction behaviors with the system. The purpose of our study was to explore whether and how “over-hype” in various contexts affects public misconceptions about AVs from the view of causality. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with a control group of 396 participants and a treatment group of 545 participants drawn from Zhenjiang, China. We applied Double Machine Learning (DML), ordered logit models, and significant difference tests to estimate the impact of “over-hype” in various contexts. The results found that the statement that “over-hype” caused public misconceptions was less rigorous. Significant causality varies among contexts of “over-hype” and aspects of misconceptions. Specifically, “over-hype” in fatal accident reports will lead to availability misconception about AVs, but not safety misconception, suggesting that participants believed AVs were available nowadays but not safe as human drivers. “Over-hype” that exaggerates ADAS capabilities has the greatest average treatment effect on public misconceptions, especially the safety misconception. We found that the young and the more educated are more likely to have safety and availability misconceptions under the “over-hype” of some contexts. However, the effects of “over-hype” varied less among groups with different socio-economic factors on the whole, which revealed the universality of the influence of “over-hype.” The results provided empirical evidence for regulating propaganda about AV technology and provided practical insights on how to introduce AV technology to the general public properly.",0965-8564,Not found
Metropolitan area heterogeneity and the impact of road infrastructure improvements on VMT,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103733,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Past studies have found that the average elasticity of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) to the stock of highways is close to one. This result is often interpreted to mean that an increase in the stock of highway miles is likely to be accompanied by a commensurate increase in VMT, leaving congestion unaffected. In this study, we explore the heterogeneity in this elasticity due to both observed and unobserved city characteristics. We begin by using a simple model to demonstrate how cities with different initial congestion levels may respond differently to added road capacity. These differences give rise to heterogeneity in the elasticity of VMT to highway capacity. We then conduct an empirical analysis using the instrumental variable quantile regression (IVQR) model to incorporate variation in the elasticity due to the presence of unobserved differences across metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). The IVQR results imply that expanding road capacities has a greater impact on MSAs with low levels of VMT than on MSAs with high VMT. Estimates of the elasticity using generalized quantile regression (GQR) mirror the IVQR estimates. We further simulate the mechanisms using a spatial equilibrium model with an extensive road network calibrated to the Greater Los Angeles region by treating commuting and shopping trips, mode, and route choices. We find that the elasticity of VMT to capacity—which decreases with initial VMT—in LA is 0.32. One important policy implication is that, when building more roads, the mean or median congestion level across cities remains unchanged, although it can reduce the number of cities experiencing high congestion levels.",0965-8564,Not found
Simulation-based policy analysis: The case of urban speed limits,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103754,175,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Speed limit policies are commonly adopted to manage and control traffic in urban areas due to their effectiveness and ease of implementation. Comprehending the complete effect of a speed limit policy is complicated and requires modeling and quantified investigations. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive simulation-based framework to assess the potential implications of different speed limit policies in urban residential areas. The framework models the policy impacts related to road safety (risk exposure for pedestrians and driving safety), traffic efficiency (travel time) and the environment (fuel consumption, exhaust emissions and noise exposure), using microscopic traffic simulation. The evaluations are conducted at various spatial granularity levels, i.e., link level, route level, origin–destination (OD) level and network level, and can be further utilized to develop relationship models between the key performance indicators (KPIs) and simulation inputs. The framework is implemented in an urban area located in the city center of Munich, Germany, and multiple speed limit scenarios are designed and compared. The results show that speed limit reduction can significantly improve road safety and environmental externalities within the modeled network/area with a relatively small cost to traffic efficiency. Such a framework can be used as an economical evidence collection method for an evidence-based policymaking approach to speed limit policies. The proposed simulation-based framework can also be further extended to adapt the assessment of other traffic-related policies.",0965-8564,Not found
Dynamic consumer preferences for electric vehicles in China: A longitudinal approach,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103797,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Sustainable innovations such as electric vehicles (EVs) are important means to address global environmental and energy sustainability challenges – one of the key agendas of current strategic government policy. Although EVs have gradually penetrated the market, existing research on consumer preferences for EVs is mostly based on cross-sectional analysis, without sufficient attention devoted to consumer preference changes over time. To fill this gap, this study proposes a longitudinal approach to extend the EV adoption research. Specifically, this study illustrates the value of studying consumer preferences for EVs from a dynamic perspective and focuses on changes in preference heterogeneity across different marketA segments over time. This study conducts three waves of stated preference experiments from 2017 to 2019 from a same group of respondents. The mixed logit analysis shows that, over these three years, Chinese consumers have become less sensitive to running cost but have been consistently valuing home charging capability and prioritized licensing for EVs. Furthermore, the perceived importance of the density of fast charging stations and overall preferences for EVs fluctuated over this period. Further analysis on preference heterogeneity finds that consumers in small cities were developing stronger preferences for battery EVs in 2018 and 2019 than in the base year of 2017, while those living in midsized and big cities did not present the preference change for battery EVs over the same period.

I argue that Wang et al. risk underestimating both new adoption and continuance intention because they model these decisions as individual-level choices. In particular, Wang et al.’s sample likely comprises a substantial share of respondents who are not the primary grocery shopper of their household. When confronted with a survey question that inquires whether they themselves have had groceries delivered, these respondents may well answer ‘no’ – even in situations where the household did, in fact, make use of such a service.

EV policy incentives, including monetary incentives, privilege incentives, demonstration incentives and charging incentives, are discussed from the perspective of policy combinations, and a variance decomposition analysis is used to solve the problem that the impact of policy incentives could not be compared cross-sectionally due to inconsistent units of measurement. The results reveal that in the short term, the policy combinations of monetary incentives and administrative controls, including purchase subsidy, purchase tax exemption and vehicle purchase restriction, are more effective in increasing the demand for EVs. However, in the long term, the policy combinations of privilege incentives, charging incentives and demonstration incentives are more effective in accelerating the adoption of EVs, such as no driving or purchase restrictions, improved charging networks, public procurement and gasoline price have a more significant long-term impact on EV sales.

This study develops a behaviourally realistic route choice model for different types of everyday cyclists and cycling trips. The analysis is based on a large-scale crowdsourced dataset of GPS trajectories including 134,169 trips from 6,523 cyclists. The model is estimated as a joint path-size logit model and accounts for a wide range of bicycle network attributes, such as bicycle infrastructure type, land use, surface type or cycle superhighways. The findings of the model reveal, for example, that infrequent cyclists feel less safe on large roads, but this effect can be accommodated with protected bicycle tracks. Interaction with other motorised and non-motorised transport modes is found to be a deterring factor for cyclists and they prefer scenic water and green areas over high-rise urban environments, especially on long trips. The model performs very well on a hold-out sample, also when considering the similarity between the observed and predicted route, not only their binary consistency. Finally, we formulate several policy measures relevant to promote cycling. Building long, continuous stretches of dedicated, protected bicycle infrastructure outside of the high-rise urban environments has the greatest potential to make cycling attractive.",0965-8564,Not found
Parking occupancy prediction under COVID-19 anti-pandemic policies: A model based on a policy-aware temporal convolutional network,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103832,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Real-time and reliable parking occupancy prediction is critical for managing transportation infrastructure and services. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and its corresponding response have led to changes in daily routines and behaviors, including travel time distribution, frequency, and parking time. Changes in parking behavior pose significant challenges for accurately predicting parking occupancy. To address this issue, we proposed a novel policy-aware temporal convolutional network (P-TCN) model that considers the policy dependence of time-series data irregularities. The model employed 3D vector data as input to predict future parking occupancy while ensuring reliability through 10-fold cross-validation. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was also utilized to analyze the impact of the feature variables on the model. Experimental results show that the P-TCN model accurately identifies the effects of anti-pandemic policies and outperforms existing models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), fully convolutional network (FCN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and temporal convolutional network (TCN). Moreover, the feature variables “policy”, “weather”, and “time information” contribute significantly to the model prediction results, with “policy” having the most significant effect.

Eliciting preferences of Indians for air travel during COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103830,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed air travel like never before. Airlines are rebuilding consumer confidence by taking several measures, such as providing luggage sanitation and flexible ticket services, blocking middle seats for social distancing, and implementing fast check-in processes. This study develops a fresh understanding of how these factors shape air travel demand in the peri-pandemic situation. To this end, we conducted a discrete choice experiment among over 600 domestic air travelers in India. The estimated discrete choice models provide the relative importance of factors in explaining travelers’ itinerary preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for new services. The results provide several policy-relevant insights. First, the maximum WTP for refundable ticket service is zero for 21% of respondents and below INR 1000 ( ≈ USD 12.5) for 84% of respondents. Air travelers who are married with children and opt for luggage sanitation services are more likely to be potential buyers of refundable tickets. Second, Indian air travelers’ WTP for fast check-in and luggage sanitation services is around 10% of the base ticket fare. Third, the airlines could increase aging travelers’ comfort and safety perception by implementing fast check-in service, as their itinerary preferences are three times more sensitive to the provision of this service than their younger counterparts. Fourth, while a blocked middle seat does not affect air travel demand, mandatory vaccination certification is preferred on average over an RT-PCR test. This study thus helps airlines to operationalize comfortable and safe air travel in peri-pandemic situations.",0965-8564,Not found
"Effects of driving restrictions on air quality and housing prices: Evidence from chengdu, China",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103829,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Many cities in the developing world have implemented the driving restriction policy to address transport-related problems (e.g., traffic congestion and air pollution). However, the evidence of the effectiveness of this policy exhibits significant regional variations. Using an abrupt policy change in Chengdu, namely the tightening of the driving restriction policy by expanding the regulated area, as a natural experiment, this study provides new evidence of the effects of driving restrictions based on the difference-in-differences approach. On the one hand, we leverage the temporal variation in the number of cars being banned on roads due to the traditional superstition (number 4) in China and the spatial variation in restricted and unrestricted areas to verify the causal effect of driving restrictions on air quality. We find that policy tightening has caused a significant reduction in major air pollutants of PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and SO2 and a decrease in the composite air quality index in a year after policy tightening. Furthermore, we observe that policy tightening has resulted in an increase in the demand for housing units located near subway stations in areas subject to the new driving restriction policy. This study affirms the effectiveness of driving restrictions in the absence of confounding influences from other travel demand management strategies. Accordingly, in the face of restrictions on private car use, it is important to increase the supply of public transport and affordable housing with good access to public transport.",0965-8564,Not found

We examine this problem in depth, both theoretically and empirically, in an effort to illustrate the most appropriate approaches to solving this problem, which has important repercussions for practice in our field.

Exploring motivations for multimodal commuting: A hierarchical means-end chain analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103831,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Despite municipal investments in multimodal mobility infrastructure, monomodal automotive travel patterns still dominate work-related mobility. As policymakers aim to reduce associated externalities like traffic congestion, noise, and air pollution, encouraging multimodality can be a promising route toward diversified, more sustainable mobility. However, studies on modal choice and modal shift have mainly focused on investigating the consumer decision-making process concerning specific monomodal travel modes and external factors but are characterized by a lack of dedicated applications in the commuting context. Therefore, insights into consumers’ motivational patterns determining intentions to engage in multimodal commuting and factors influencing their willingness to alter the modal mix remain scarce. With a qualitative means-end chain (MEC) analysis, we explore consumers’ overarching motivational structures to choose multimodal commuting behavior through laddering interviews with forty employees from two large German employers. We contribute to existing research by revealing five motivational patterns that promote consumers' decision to become multimodal commuters: autonomy, physical health, sustainability, quality of life, and interpersonal connections, which we juxtapose with previous findings. Interestingly, we find that economic interest, security, and fun are only motives of secondary importance. Consequently, we propose implications for academics, policymakers, and practitioners to foster commuters choosing more sustainable, multimodal mobility.",0965-8564,Not found
Optimizing bike network design: A cost-effective methodology for heterogeneous travel demands using continuous approximation techniques,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103826,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"This study presents a methodological framework for determining the most cost-effective design parameters for bike networks in cities with heterogenous travel demands. The suggested model utilizes continuous approximation techniques to calculate the optimal length and spacing between bike lanes, determine the number and location of bike-sharing stations, and estimate the appropriate fleet size (number of bikes). Throughout the process, both user and agency interests are considered. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, an example is provided using data from the City of Guayaquil, Ecuador. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is performed to gain further insights into the impact of significant parameters on the network design. The results indicate that agency costs constitute a relatively small proportion of the overall network costs compared to user costs. This finding suggests that the initial investment in facilities has been amortized over time, highlighting the network's long-term viability. Moreover, the study demonstrates that an increase in demand does not necessarily require a corresponding increase in investment. To strike a balance, the model tends to offer a reduced number of facilities, such as bikes, stations, and kilometers of lanes per person, while simultaneously densifying the network to reduce user access times, resulting in shorter total travel times for users. The proposed optimization model serves as a valuable tool for urban planners, aiding them in strategic design decisions during the planning stage of bike mobility systems.",0965-8564,Not found
An indispensable role in promoting the electric vehicle Industry: An empirical test to explore the integration framework of electric vehicle charger and electric vehicle purchase behavior,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103824,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Extensive research on electric vehicle charging infrastructure has been conducted within the field of electric vehicle purchase behavior, yet home electric vehicle charging infrastructure remains largely unexplored.

From a transportation context, there is the potential for unintended positive consequences on sustainability made possible by working remotely or from home (WFH) which reduced mobility significantly. However, there were some significant negative effects such as the increase of car use leading to congestion and erosion of sustainability gains. This paper uses data collected during the three years of the pandemic (2020, 2021 and 2022) in two metropolitan areas in Australia to estimate the changes in workers’ daily decision to not work, WFH or to commute by different modes of transport with a special focus on active modes and public transport. A hybrid choice model is estimated which includes three latent variables: life satisfaction, concern towards the use of public transport, and social-meeting loving attitude. Results suggest that WFH has settled as a valid and efficient alternative to a regular workplace, given the reduced stigmas employers increasingly support this flexible hybrid working model. Moreover, results show that the majority of these “saved” commuting trips were previously by car, and not by more sustainable options such as public transport and active modes. If respondents do not have the option to WFH and thus have to attend the workplace, the increase in commuting trips tends to be by car, despite evidence of some amount of return to public transport.",0965-8564,Not found
Seamless air-HSR intermodal solution: Behavioural model-based scheduling of airline timetable and airfare,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103821,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Empirical experience of air and high-speed rail (HSR) cooperation in Europe and China indicates that seamless intermodal connections are crucial for expanding air-HSR integration services’ market share, particularly in long-haul travel. Given that substantial practical obstacles impede the integrated scheduling of air and HSR systems, adapting oneself to the former competitor is of great practical value but remains largely underexplored. This paper presents a method for improving synchronous operations of air and HSR by unilaterally scheduling airline timetable and airfare, which is an attempt to facilitate air-HSR cooperation to an advanced level of operational integration. Accordingly, a stated preference survey was conducted in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei mega-city region to uncover traveller preferences for air-HSR integration services (AHISs) in the airport cluster context based on discrete choice modelling. Using behavioural models as travel demand assignment criteria, an on-demand scheduling model is developed to maximise the total revenue of air transport involved in AHISs. The empirical case investigates AHISs from Beijing to twenty domestic cities via Shijiazhuang Zhengding International Airport. The results show that the optimal scheduling solution decreases air-HSR connection time by a maximum of 41.83% and highlights the necessity of providing efficient shuttle systems, baggage through-check and flexible ticket services to enhance intermodal product appeal. Additionally, incorporating an airfare adjustment mechanism into timetable scheduling is proven supportive of increasing air transport’s revenue up to 16.44% while promoting seamless AHISs, thereby ensuring practical motivation for AHIS upgrades.",0965-8564,Not found
Promote transport facility Resilience: Persuasion or Subsidy?,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103822,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"This paper studies an information provision game between a better-informed government (on the climate change-related disaster) and a transport facility operator. The government can acquire better disaster information and adopt a persuasion strategy to affect the facility operator’s adaptation investment. The Bayesian persuasion framework is used to model the government’s design on its information signaling mechanism. We also solve the equilibrium outcomes of government subsidy policy and benchmark them with those under the persuasion strategy. Our analytical results suggest that the government’s optimal persuasion strategy depends on the common prior belief on the disaster and the expected level of unavoidable loss (NL). When the NL is low (or intermediate, respectively), the persuasion strategy should be full (or partial, respectively) disclosure of the government’s information to the facility operator. When the NL is high, the persuasion strategy has no impacts. In terms of social welfare improvement, the persuasion strategy dominates (or is dominated by, respectively) the subsidy policy if the effectiveness of the adaptation investment is low (or high, respectively). When the effectiveness of the adaptation investment is intermediate, the comparison is uncertain. Furthermore, we extend our model to the oligopoly case with multiple competing transport facilities and also allow their adaptation investments to have positive externality. We find that more intense competition among the facility operators leads to more conservative persuasion strategy, and larger spillover effect of the adaptation investment among facilities leads to more radical persuasion strategy.",0965-8564,Not found
Pattern analysis of Japanese long-distance travel change under the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103805,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The Japanese government implemented a request for people to reduce movement to suppress the spatial spread of COVID-19. Individuals cancelled relatively unimportant activities according to their perceived risk of infection and the changing level of the request because it carried no penalties. Thus, what long-distance travel patterns were reduced in response to these messages and the situation? Mobile phone location data is a powerful tool to answer the question. However, mobile phone location data has a major disadvantage that it does not include information regarding the purpose of travel such as business or leisure. Therefore, this study proposes an approach that uses other survey data regarding travel purpose information in addition to mobile phone location data to analyze the effects of COVID-19 on long-distance travel behavior. In our approach, information regarding a large number of origin–destination pairs is explained by a small number of representative travel patterns that are explicitly related to travel purpose. The results of this approach show that travel behavioral changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic differed for each travel pattern. Certain patterns were highly sensitive, and many people cancelled unimportant activities for a period longer than the government’s request period. In contrast, sensitivity was relatively low for short-distance travel.",0965-8564,Not found
"Understanding the influencing factors of taxi ride-sharing: A case study of Chengdu, China",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103819,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The emergence and development of taxi ride-sharing can improve the efficiency of urban transportation systems and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in cities. Using GPS tracking data from taxis in Chengdu, China, we firstly provide a method for judging the conditions under which taxi rides are shareable, and then analyse the potential demand for taxi ride-sharing from both time and space perspectives. We develop a variable selection model to evaluate the key influencing factors for taxi ride-sharing. The results show there is a large potential taxi ride-sharing market in Chengdu, and the development of shared transportation is dependent on certain practical conditions. Both orders for taxis and those for taxi ride-sharing are concentrated in central city zones. It is verified that the number of taxi orders is positively correlated to the potential demand for taxi ride-sharing. It is also learnt that factors including population density, average traffic speed and regional GDP are negatively correlated to the demand for taxi ride-sharing. Factors such as traffic facilities, bus stops and life services have positive effects. In terms of the first-grade indices, weather and climatic conditions, traffic infrastructure construction and some land-use functions have a positive effect on the demand, while population and regional economic conditions and other environmental features have negative effects. In fact, only the indicators of population density, GDP, average traffic speed and the number of traffic facilities and bus stops have great effects on the demand for taxi ride-sharing. The other 29 factors in our indicator system play a much less important role. This quantitative model finds the key influencing factors and can help us to understand the dynamics driving residents’ demand for taxi ride-sharing. It may assist the relevant government departments to optimize taxi resources and promote the sustainable development of taxi ride-sharing.",0965-8564,Not found
Social groups in pedestrian crowds as physical and cognitive entities: Extent of modeling and motion prediction,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103820,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Most pedestrian crowds are composed of social groups that are typically formed by dyads (two members), triads (three members), or larger groups. Depending on the context, social groups may make up half or even more of the membership of the crowd. Therefore, understanding their motion is crucial for predicting crowd dynamics. The presence of social groups modifies crowd behavior. When the proportion and size of groups are known, crowd motion (e.g., the “flow” of passengers collectively moving inside a train station) could become predictable. However, a bidirectional flow experiment performed in 2010 revealed that the presence of groups could lead to partially surprising results because crowds composed of small social groups moved more smoothly than those composed of individuals (singletons). Results were partially disregarded because of statistical insignificance. A subsequent experiment in 2015 with latest tracking techniques resulted in similar results and investigated the cause of the superior flow in the presence of groups. The results revealed that when groups arrange themselves in certain shapes, their partially “obstructing” nature (in a counterintuitive manner) facilitates lane formation, which benefits overall crowd motion. Because the arrangement of a dyad, i.e., whether both members walk next to each other or in a front–back alignment, is partially linked to the coordination (or the lack thereof) between both members, predicting such a mechanism is difficult. Simulation results from a commercial software program confirmed that predicting the dynamics of social groups is not trivial; however, at the macroscopic scale, some general trends are depicted at least from a qualitative perspective. This study revealed that, whenever possible, several crowd composition patterns should be considered when planning crowd events or drafting safety guidelines for pedestrian facilities. Depending on the context, crowds composed of individuals may move smoother than social groups do, and the worst-case scenario should be used for determining safety margins. Thus, we revealed that predicting the motion of crowds composed of social groups is difficult because the microscopic organization within the group determines overall crowd dynamics. Although this internal organization may result in counterintuitively efficient group structures, the occurrence of such conditions depends on several variables, which renders crowd control in social groups complex, requiring close monitoring especially at high densities.",0965-8564,Not found

We find that when a monopoly EV manufacturer builds and operates its own charging stations or two competing EV manufacturers jointly build and operate charging infrastructure, EVS always leads to higher levels of charging infrastructure and social welfare. If the charging infrastructure contractor is a third-party company in a monopoly or duopoly EV market, or one of the EV manufacturers in a duopoly EV market, CIS may result in higher social welfare under two conditions: a high benefit-cost ratio for charging infrastructure deployment and a low charging fee under which the charging infrastructure contractor has a weak incentive to build the charging infrastructure. We then examine how EV competition affects the effectiveness of the policies. We show that when a third-party company builds the charging infrastructure, compared with a monopoly EV market, in a duopoly EV market, it is more likely that CIS leads to higher social welfare than EVS. Finally, through simulations, we show that in the US and Germany, EVS appears to be a more effective EV incentive, while in China, CIS can be more socially beneficial. In addition, the current subsidy levels in the above markets should still be increased to achieve higher social welfare.",0965-8564,Not found

Although parking is a crucial aspect that needs to be addressed, the attitudes and preferences of delivery drivers in urban settings have not been studied. This paper analyzes drivers’ perspectives from a survey conducted in the northeastern United States. Stated preferences data were collected and analyzed using a mixed logit and a hybrid discrete choice model. The results show that three variables impact the selection of parking spaces: searching time, walking (access) time to the delivery destination, and cost per hour of parking. The research shows that Safe Behavior, a moderating latent variable, influences parking choices and impacts drivers differently. We also observed that the first choice for drivers is to park in an available spot, followed by double parking. Even though drivers try to avoid parking in restricted areas, their priority is making their deliveries on time. Based on the modeling findings, the authors provide recommendations to policymakers and logistics service providers (carriers) to improve last-mile operations and reduce the cost of deliveries in urban areas.",0965-8564,Not found

Evidence from smart meter data of household electricity consumption,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103787,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"While high-speed railway (HSR) often brings regional prosperity and a boom in real estate, it is unclear how the housing vacancy rate (HVR) changes after the opening of HSR. We identify the HVR changes in response to HSR operation by employing smart meter data of approximately 10 million households in more than 80 counties in the middle and lower regions of the Yangtze River Basin. We find that HSR opening could reduce the urban HVR by 1.64% and its reducing effect is stronger in district-urban than in county-urban areas. The decreasing effect of HSR operation on urban HVR is more noticeable in areas with better air quality, lower living costs, and more service industries. The opposite effects are observed in rural areas, where the HSR operation has increased the rural HVR by 1.16%. Our findings indicate that the siphoning effect of HSR exists on HVR as the rural population along the HSR is attracted to central cities, and positive HSR promotion strategies contribute to reducing urban HVR. With the development of transportation infrastructure, the difference in HVR due to urban and rural population mobility should be taken into account.",0965-8564,Not found

Exploring Japan's older adults mobility challenges and the potential role of autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103818,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Mobility is essential for maintaining human well-being, as it aids in accessing basic needs and engaging in social activities. For older adults who drive, driving provides a sense of independence and convenience, allowing them to go wherever and whenever necessary. However, the declining physical condition and cognitive functions of older adults may eventually hinder their ability to drive safely. In Japan, many older drivers prefer to continue driving unless they are officially deemed unfit, reach a certain age, or have someone drive for them. To shed light on the mobility challenges faced by Japan's older adults, we analyzed data from the Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR) survey using exploratory analysis methods such as multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and nonparametric tests. The results revealed relatively strong relationships between car ownership and self-rated health status, the number of years lived in the current municipality, and the working status of older adults. Furthermore, we identified a higher level of independence, as well as a positive attitude and tendency to give and receive help running errands, among older adults who own at least one car. To assist older drivers in maintaining their mobility and the positive social effects associated with car ownership, this study discusses the potential role of autonomous vehicles (AVs).

Transit-oriented development and floor area ratio regulation in a transportation corridor: Formulation and a case study,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103814,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Transit-oriented development (TOD) has been recognized as an effective measure to alleviate traffic congestion and emissions through improving land-use intensity.

Uncompleted services are a source of strong dissatisfaction by customers, particularly since they were probably aware that their requested service was scheduled for the day. The possibility of predicting how many and which are going to be these uncompleted services becomes an effective decision-making tool that would allow carriers to increase their perceived service levels without increasing the number of couriers and vehicles. This issue is addressed through the combination of two models. Firstly, machine learning techniques are applied to estimate how many services will remain uncompleted on a given route. Secondly, the use of clustering techniques is proposed as the basis to predict the routes to be followed by couriers, thus identifying potentially uncompleted services as the last ones in each route. The posited methodology is illustrated with a case study comprising four regions in Spain, obtaining promising results in terms of the predictive capacity and the accuracy of the models.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of company cars on car ownership,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103803,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Amidst the current period of urgent and costly climate abatement policies being implemented, company cars as a fringe benefit receive surprisingly little attention from policy and research, despite evidence showing that they not only result in substantial welfare losses but also in increased car ownership and use. Therefore, this paper adds to the evidence on how company cars increase car use. We estimate how the possession of a company car impacts the households’ probability of possessing at least one car and the total car possession (the sum of privately owned and company cars). We use register micro-panel data, covering all households in Sweden, allowing us to study the effect of company cars in the full population while accounting for household-specific time-invariant unobserved preferences. It also allows us to study asymmetric effects of gaining versus losing a company car. We regress temporal changes in car possession on temporal changes in company car possession, applying a fixed effect (FE) estimator for single and couple households separately. A company car increases the probability of having at least one car in single and couple households by 38% and 14%, respectively. For couple households, we find a small asymmetric effect, such that the impact of the company car on car possession is slightly larger when the car is received than when it is lost. For single households the effect is symmetric. Moreover, a company car increases car possession by on average 0.26 cars for couple households possessing at least one car. Since roughly 80% of the mileage of these cars is attributed to private purposes in Sweden, these results indicate that the current company car taxation also increases car use.",0965-8564,Not found
Scaling up active transportation across North America: A comparative content analysis of policies through a social equity framework,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103788,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Federal governments across North America are increasingly working to scale up active-transport investments to harmonize policy efforts aimed at addressing intersecting urban, environmental, and public-health problems. While such policies promise to provide increased support for cycling, walking, and other active mobilities, the extent to which central-government interventions can foster wide-reaching and equitable infrastructure transitions remains an open question. This paper offers a comparison of recent federal policy initiatives aimed at supporting the development of active-transport facilities across Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Using a comparative content-analysis approach, we analyse federal active-transport strategies in terms of policy development, goals, instruments, as well as social-equity and road-safety considerations. Findings indicate that policy instruments, development resources, and social-equity mechanisms vary considerably between the three countries. While Canada’s recent policies offer targeted project funding for active transport, its national road-safety vision lacks attention to social equity concerns. The United States’ policies emphasize large-scale infrastructure transitions, but risk deprioritizing active-transport projects within wider investments. Mexico’s new mobility and road safety law lacks infrastructure funding but leads in its human-rights approach. While these variances can be attributed to specific differences between national contexts, we posit that they also provide insights into shared challenges and opportunities in federal efforts aimed at providing comprehensive support for active-transport systems. Through a systematic content analysis of recent policies, this paper aims to provide an exploratory assessment of how federal governments are mobilizing diverse approaches to active-transport policymaking and to contribute to multi-scalar theorizing on transport equity and mobility justice.",0965-8564,Not found

We further perform Monte Carlo studies for the U.S. and Germany to quantify these decisions, assess consequences on distances traveled and traffic-related externalities, and evaluate whether transport pricing can reduce the latter. Our findings suggest that WFC is a likely feature of tomorrow’s world, but it comes at the cost of induced traffic and traffic-related externalities. Eventually, we see that standard transport-policy instruments on car use, traveling, and parking affect the number of mobile employees, i.e., those with WFC contracts, but do not lower distances traveled per mobile employee. Given these tentative findings, a policy to lower traffic and emissions shall primarily focus on avoiding WFC contracts.

Finally, we show that airlines do not benefit from leasing in the same proportions depending on their ability to have access to capital markets as a funding source, on the extent to which governments own part of the airline’s shares and may act as a guarantee for investors, or on their business model.",0965-8564,Not found
The capitalization and urbanization effect of subway stations: A network centrality perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103815,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"This study assesses the economic effects of subway investments in China by focusing on the network centrality of subway stations, an important factor that has been overlooked in the literature on station proximity. We estimate the annual network centrality of 3,540 subway stations in China using the social network analysis method, and analyze the effect of this centrality on surrounding land prices, land allocations, and land revenues from 2007 to 2019 using a large land dataset and multiple regression methods. Our findings indicate that the expansion of subway networks generates significant economic benefits. Specifically, higher network centrality of subway stations has a positive capitalization effect on land prices, facilitates government land allocation, and leads to increased land revenues, which can be used for future subway investments. This suggests a novel and sustainable subway investment model based on constructing subways to nurture land value, and selling land to fund subway construction. Moreover, we find that the effects of network centrality vary depending on land use, proximity to the station, urban land availability, and subway traffic volume. Based on these results, we discuss the implications of this model and the boundary conditions of its application to other regions and countries to finance their rail transit investments, as well as the challenges to sustaining this model in China.",0965-8564,Not found
Are low emission zones and on-street parking management effective in reducing parking demand for most polluting vehicles and promoting greener ones?,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103813,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Parking Management and Low Emission Zones (LEZs) are two of the most widely applied policies to reduce the negative externalities of private vehicles in urban areas and, in particular, to prevent the incorrect use of public spaces and encourage drivers to use the parking service more efficiently. Recently, some cities have been adjusting these measures to the environmental characteristics of the vehicles, but up to date, there is little empirical evidence about the effectiveness of that measures. The objective of the paper is to explore to what extent Parking Management and the implementation of LEZs reduce the parking demand of the most polluting vehicles. Based on a detailed database obtained from parking payment records (more than 50 million) in Madrid (Spain), a spatial econometric approach is conducted to analyze the impact of both policies on parking demand. Our analysis indicates that implementing Parking Management and LEZ policies resulted in more efficient use of parking space by incentivizing the use of environmentally friendly vehicles and reducing demand for highly polluting ones. This was achieved through a combination of LEZ restrictions and parking fare incentives or penalties linked to the environmental label of the vehicle. Consequently, on-street parking became a more attractive option for clean vehicles. Interestingly, this study also found that this phenomenon significantly impacted overall parking behavior throughout the city, not just within the LEZ.",0965-8564,Not found
Estimating city-wide hourly bicycle flow using a hybrid LSTM MDN,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103783,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Cycling can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and increase public health. Hence, policymakers in cities worldwide seek to improve bicycle mode shares. Efforts to increase the bicycle’s mode share involve many measures, one of them being the improvement of cycling safety often requiring an analysis of the factors surrounding accidents. However, meaningful analysis of cycling safety requires accurate bicycle flow data that are generally sparse or only available at the aggregate level. Therefore, safety engineers often rely on aggregated variables or calibration factors that fail to account for variations in the cycling traffic relevant to policymaking. This paper illustrates how machine learning can support policy analysis by delivering detailed bicycle flow predictions. The illustration applies a Deep Learning approach, the Long Short-Term Memory Mixture Density Network (LSTMMDN), to estimate hourly bicycle flow in Copenhagen, conditional on weather, temporal and road conditions at the segment level. The method addresses some shortcomings in the calibration factor method resulting in 66–77% more accurate bicycle traffic estimates. To quantify the impact of more accurate bicycle traffic estimates in cycling safety analysis, we test the effect of different flow estimates in a bicycle crash risk model, i.e. the models are identical except for the exposure variables. One model is estimated using the LSTMMDN estimates, one using the calibration-based estimates, and one using yearly mean traffic estimates. The results show that investing in more advanced methods for obtaining bicycle volume estimates can improve the quality of safety analyses and other performance measures.",0965-8564,Not found
A system dynamics analysis of the trans-Pacific trade lane during the pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103802,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"A consequence of the pandemic was significant disruption to global container flows from 2020 to 2022, with cargo time spent in containers, container ship congestion in ports, and container dwell times in terminals all peaking during this period. After reviewing 2020 and 2021 data for the trans-Pacific trade lane, this paper presents a system dynamics model that explains how these factors are related to each other. The model highlights the importance of the speed with which containers are loaded and unloaded for the dwell time of container ships in ports, the dwell time of containers in terminals, and rollovers (containers left behind). It is shown that port congestion propagates to all ports in the same port rotation (tour). An analysis of the mathematical model behind the system dynamics model indicates precisely when the “tipping point” is reached and congestion propagates. The mathematical model also suggests some remedies, like reducing the number of ports in port rotations and increasing productivity at one port to compensate for a loss of productivity at another port on the same rotation.",0965-8564,Not found
Equity in network design and pricing: A discretely-constrained MPEC problem,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103800,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"This paper presents a novel transport network design approach that incorporates supply- and demand-side factors and emphasises equity as a key objective. The proposed model introduces a planning agency as the dominant player responsible for strategic decision-making to regulate the market and influence the behaviours of other participants. The paper addresses the complex dynamics between the planning agency and other players by formulating and solving a Stackelberg game within a network-constrained transport system. The proposed formulation is a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) which can capture this interaction effectively. The MPEC is reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to solve the model by employing disjunctive constraints. To demonstrate the model's capabilities for policy analysis, we conduct numerical experiments on a toy network in Sydney. The computational models developed in this study provide insights into the impacts of different network designs on important aspects of transport systems, including equality in subsidy distribution, toll collection, and modal share among different user groups.",0965-8564,Not found
The role of time budgets in models of multi-tasking while travelling: A comparison between the MDCEV and eMDC approach,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103796,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The increasingly widespread use of mobile technologies and connectivity as well as vehicle automation have triggered renewed attention to the issue of productivity and enjoyment of time spent travelling. Rejecting the traditional assumption that travel time is “wasted”, questions of whether improved fruition of time spent travelling can help encourage PT ridership and affect the uptake of autonomous vehicles draw increasing interest. Yet, the investigation of how people spend travel time, especially from a modelling standpoint, is still an emerging field in travel behaviour research. This paper contributes to this area of study by jointly analysing activity engagement and time use while travelling, with a particular focus on multitasking, i.e. conducting activities other than travel. The application of the newly developed extended Multiple Discrete-Continuous (eMDC) model allows the relaxation of the assumption of a defined time budget, allowing the performance of multiple activities at the same time, and permits investigating substitutions and complementarity effects between different activities. The eMDC is found to be more suitable to model multitasking compared to existing approaches because (i) it does not require arbitrarily dropping activities when they are performed at the same time, and (ii) it allows capturing complementarity and substitution effects. By applying the model to the UK Time-Use Survey, we find that social and work activities as well as social and mass media consumption are substitutes while travelling. We also forecast time-use changes under different transport policy scenarios, proving impacts of substitution effects. While eMDC is our preferred approach, we observe that depending on the choice of modelling framework, the results can lead to different conclusions concerning suitability of particular policy measures. Hence, for future applications, testing of different frameworks is advised to assess sensitivity of the conclusions to the implicit modelling assumptions.",0965-8564,Not found
Do ICT development and internet use decrease intra-regional work-related travel?,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103786,176,2023-10-01,2023,10,"Technological advancements and the COVID-19 pandemic raised attention about the virtual substitutability of in-person interactions. To learn from the past twenty years' history before COVID, we examine intra-regional work-related trips in the US National Household Travel Surveys. The study finds heterogeneous and dynamic associations between internet usage and work-related travel behavior. First, the overall declining trends are prominent in work-related travel likelihood, particularly between 2009 and 2017, coinciding with the wide acceptance of virtual communication. Second, however, internet usage is often positively associated with the probability of work-related trips in the cross-sectional analysis. For instance, the travel likelihood of internet-savvy sales and service workers was consistently higher than their non-savvy counterparts in the same year. Third, the associations' magnitude and timing are heterogeneous across occupations, possibly because of the differences in the communication types. For example, internet usage positively correlated with sales and service workers' travel likelihood and travel volume per worker throughout the period. In contrast, it was negatively associated with the travel distance of professional and managerial workers in 2001 and their travel volume in 2001 and 2009, suggesting a virtual substitution of costly work-related travel. Although our conclusion is limited to intra-regional travel, the strong declining trend in travel likelihood is a promising element for a sustainable future because travel reduction remains desirable for climate justice, even in the post-pandemic era.",0965-8564,Not found

We constructed a multidimensional dataset and developed an effective data-driven predictive model to investigate causality between a policy, mobility, and an infection, drawing upon spatiotemporal perspectives. The multidimensional dataset included daily infections, daily restriction policies, and daily and hourly multimodal travel patterns. We quantified and normalized the dataset in relation to pre-COVID-19 policies and travel activities. A machine learning framework that integrated principal component analysis (PCA) and a Gaussian process regression (GPR) was formulated to evaluate the effectiveness of mobility restriction policies and their optimal implementation time during the infancy stage of the pandemic. In a case study, we selected Seoul in South Korea and Sydney in Australia for model calibrations and validations. Both countries deployed comprehensive urban restriction policies during the worldwide pandemic. The proposed model produced better performance than diverse non-parametric and parametric models to estimate the daily number of infections in the two areas. Furthermore, we discovered effective restriction policies and the best times to implement them to minimize the number of acquired COVID-19 cases by analyzing coefficients in PCA and GPR kernel functions. Our finding has far-reaching policy implications. First, the proposed methods can be used for formulating restriction policies for other regions with diverse population densities as the chosen cities in this case study.

How air transport networks respond to long-lasting disruptive events like COVID-19: The first step toward long-term resilience,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103836,177,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Resilience is critical for the air transport network (ATN) to cope with disruptive events like the COVID-19 pandemic, while the first step in understanding resilience is to reveal how the ATN responds to disruptions. This paper presents a method for investigating how the ATN responds to the COVID-19 pandemic from its outbreak through deterioration, adaptation, and restoration. The concept of system state is introduced to investigate when the ATN has substantially changed. By comparing the structure of the temporal ATN in different weeks based on network similarity assessment, the changing points of the ATN are detected, where the network system has switched from one state to another. To quantify what are the changes to the ATN’s structure, several performance metrics, including global and local connectivity, are evaluated around the changing points. Moreover, to study the response time of the ATN to the pandemic, the time lag between the changing points of the ATN and that of the confirmed cases is examined. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the ATNs of Mainland China and the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in some interesting findings and policy implications. It is found that in a pandemic outbreak, China is more likely to suspend routes directly, while the U.S. is reducing flight frequency to maintain essential airport connections. Further, the state transition of ATNs caused by policies is temporary, while the state change caused by the pandemic is permanent.",0965-8564,Not found
Aviation resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case study of the European aviation market,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103835,177,2023-11-01,2023,11,"The European aviation industry experienced an unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have a profound impact on the industry in the years to come. An investigation of the European aviation market’s performance during the pandemic and the recovery pattern is very important. Such an analysis provides an assessment of the aviation industry’s actual resilience against large-scale disruptions thus that the sector can be better prepared for future disruptions and challenges. More importantly, it contributes to a better understanding of the best business practices and industry policies in a dynamic aviation environment, and how the aviation industry may sustain growth in the years to come. For these purposes, this study first presents an overview of the European aviation market’s performance for the period of 2019–2020. In general, aviation connectivity (airports and airlines) recovered to around 60 % of the 2019 level, but less than 40 % in terms of flight movements at the end of 2020. Second, an ordered Probit model is applied to investigate the driving factors for airport and airline resilience in the European aviation market, respectively. Four key findings are obtained: (i) the number of flights is an important indicator of airport and airline resilience/recovery performance; (ii) higher airline concentration at an airport might have improved the airport’s recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. On the airline side, an airline’s higher concentration of flights at airports tends to benefit its resilience (iii) the implementation of the airport slot waiver policy, which suspended the “use it or lose it” rules, had positive impacts on airline resilience; (iv) airports with higher shares of full-service airlines (FSAs) services, or more low-cost carriers (LCCs) in service, are better positioned in recovery. There are no systematic differences caused by carrier types. Overall, our study of the European aviation market reveals positive resilience effects of market concentration and firm scale.

Capacity Utilization of U.S. Airports: A Data Envelopment Analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103840,177,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Air travel demand is forecasted to grow substantially following a long standstill period. However, it is unclear whether the air transportation industry is adequately equipped to handle this surge. In particular, concerns about the airport capacity have resurfaced. While previous studies have extensively examined airport capacity from an engineering perspective, an economic capacity assessment could shed further light on this issue. We examine the capacity structure of 59 large and medium hub airports in the U.S. in the years from 2015 to 2019 with a linear programming model that includes a modified DEA based on Johansen (1968)’s capacity definition and a standard DEA. In addition, a probit model is employed to investigate if external factors, such as airport size, legacy airline hub status, multi-airport system, population, and per capita income in metropolitan statistical areas account for excess capacity. The major findings in the first stage of analysis are: (i) Based on 2019 estimates, 76% of sample airports would not experience a capacity problem in the next seven years after air traffic returns to the pre-pandemic levels if the variable inputs like the number of employees and operating expenditures are utilized; (ii) the average efficiency of U.S. airports in the sample period is 0.79, indicating that the airports could increase their output by 21%; (iii) the variable inputs are underutilized, suggesting that there is a shortage of these inputs, and (iv) capacity utilization rates of large hub airports are 9% higher than the medium hubs. The second stage of our analysis provides deeper insights into the findings from the first stage, revealing that larger airports and airports in a multi-airport system are less likely to experience excess capacity. Besides, the results identify population as a significant factor, with a larger population leading to a lower probability of excess capacity. Overall, this study suggests that the US airport industry could benefit from improved efficiency and better utilization of variable inputs to meet the expected surge in air traffic demand.",0965-8564,Not found
Evaluating the accessibility and availability of public services to reduce inequalities in everyday mobility,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103833,177,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Mapping job accessibility and sociospatial inequalities is a crucial task to support the design and evaluation of public policies and services. Although the concept of accessibility encompasses similar dimensions across studies, which involve the interaction between transport systems and land use, its implementation varies substantially depending on the research or policy need, mode of transport, and data availability. In this paper, we employ the optimization-based accessibility metric, adapted from the optimum accessibility landscapes measure, to the analysis of the accessibility and availability of public services that are essential to everyday mobility in the cities of São Paulo and Curitiba, in Brazil. Since it simultaneously captures supply and demand as endogenous variables in an optimization algorithm, without losing communicability, we argue that the metric may be particularly useful to public policies that involve decisions at multiple territorial scales and government levels, such as schools, healthcare facilities, and greenspaces. By identifying locations with no access to public services due to lack of proximity and service capacity, locations with low access to public services due to long distances and spatial barriers, and locations with access to poor quality services, it is possible to better inform the formulation and prioritization of public policies aiming at reducing inequalities in everyday mobility, with differential effects according to social class, race, and gender.",0965-8564,Not found
Bus splitting and bus holding: A new strategy using autonomous modular buses for preventing bus bunching,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103825,177,2023-11-01,2023,11,"Autonomous Modular Buses (AMBs) with in-motion transfer capability can be more effective in preventing bus bunching than strategies available with conventional buses, such as bus-holding and/or stop-skipping. We previously proposed bus-splitting, a novel alternative to stop-skipping that directs a modular bus to decouple into individual units when it experiences a longer than normal headway. Despite outperforming stop-skipping, bus-splitting alone cannot eliminate bunching completely since it cannot increase short headways. Therefore, we now propose an integrated strategy that combines bus-splitting with bus-holding so that headways that are both shorter or longer than required can be corrected. We conduct a macroscopic simulation based on a bus route in Hangzhou, China, to compare our combined strategy with standalone bus-splitting as well as stop-skipping combined with bus-holding. Our strategy outperforms the others in terms of reducing both the average travel cost and its variation, limiting the overhead of bus bunching to below 10% under realistic system utilization levels. A bus service adopting the proposed strategy would therefore be more cost-effective, reliable, and attractive for commuters, potentially increasing its ridership and reducing the mode share of private vehicles.",0965-8564,Not found

The returns to density (RTD), the returns to scale (RTS), the cost complementarities and the economies of scope (SC) are estimated. The key findings and policy implications are as follows: (1). RTD and RTS of RRAs are 3.56 and 1.19, respectively, suggesting very significant returns to density and slight returns to scale at RRA level. (2). 1% increase in passenger output would increase the marginal costs of freight operations and network infrastructure by 0.233% and 0.808%, respectively. 1% increase in freight output would increase the marginal costs of passenger operations and network infrastructure by 0.486% and 0.735%, respectively. 1% increase in network infrastructure would increase the marginal costs of passenger operations and freight operations by 0.809% and 0.736%, respectively. (3). The economy of scope (SC) between passenger operation and freight operation is −0.189, implying no existence of economy of scope.

Understanding the role of risk perception and health measures in ridesourcing usage in the post-COVID-19 era,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103877,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on how people perceive health risks when using ridesharing services, as there is an increased risk of transmission. To mitigate this risk, individuals have implemented self-imposed preventive measures, while ridesharing service providers have introduced health measures to reduce the likelihood of transmission and encourage ridership. To understand the impact of COVID-19 on ridesharing usage and willingness to use it, we propose a framework to study the relationship between influencing factors (such as risk perception, vaccination status, and self-imposed or service-imposed non-pharmaceutical health measures like masks and/or sanitizing) and ridesharing-related decisions and intention. A web-based survey in China collected over 2300 responses, and Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes models were estimated to investigate the influencing factors’ impacts on ridesourcing service usage at the later stage of the pandemic when China was still under Zero-COVID policy and their willingness to use it after the pandemic. The estimation results indicate that risk perception, self-imposed and service-imposed health measures, post-pandemic expectations of these measures are key influencing factors, along with certain sociodemographic and travel behavior factors. These findings can help decision-makers develop strategies to support the recovery of ridesharing services in the post-COVID-19 era.",0965-8564,Not found

Given two complementary or substitutable ports in which oligopolistic liners are operating, an alliance between complementary liners, referred to as “global alliance”, enhances their strategic complementarity, which makes shocks more easily propagating among ports and increases volatility of the price and volumes of shipping services. Furthermore, due to incomplete adjustment of production facilities of shippers facing unexpected shocks, the shipping demand in the short term is less elastic than that in the long term. It is shown that the increased market volatility of global alliance causes a greater decline in shippers' benefit under a shock through i) shippers' inefficient investment and ii) an excessive price increase in transportation services, while the liners’ profit may even increase owing to the second effect.",0965-8564,Not found

This empirical study aims to fill this research gap by examining the impacts of ridesourcing on the taxi market in England and Wales. Using biennial Taxi and Private Hire Vehicle (PHV) Statistics data from the Department for Transport spanning 2005 to 2019, we investigate the impacts of ridesourcing on the number of Hackney Carriages (HCs) and PHVs, as well as the employment patterns in the taxi sector. Our findings indicate a gradual decline in the number of HCs following the introduction of ridesourcing. In contrast, the number of PHVs, which are restricted to pre-bookings, gradually increased. However, we observed no statistically significant change in the number of taxi drivers on average. Notably, our analysis reveals heterogeneous effects across different areas, including rural, urban, and metropolitan districts. Furthermore, we explore the role of regulatory environments in the evolution of ridesourcing and traditional taxi services. Our study highlights that regulation change allowing PHVs to operate across borders may lead to a dramatic increase in the number of PHVs and taxi drivers in specific local authorities. Our research has important implications for policymakers and transportation authorities, particularly in terms of maintaining a competitive taxi market.

"Effects of a price incentive policy on urban rail transit passengers: A case study in Nanjing, China",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103879,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"To alleviate travel congestion at peak periods or on congested routes, some measures for urban rail transit (URT) systems including fare incentive schemes and subsidy policies have been widely adopted. Existing measures can alleviate demand during peak periods or on congested routes to a certain extent, but they do not consider the passengers’ satisfaction with their travel experience. Consequently, this study aims to investigate passengers’ acceptance of a fare incentive policy offering a discounted fare during off-peak periods or on uncongested routes before it is implemented in Nanjing, China. To understand passengers’ acceptance of the policy, this study explores the effects of the policy on passengers’ route choices. Furthermore, the differences among passengers with respect to different travel purposes and travel times in route choices have been analyzed. A revealed preference (RP) survey and a stated preference (SP) survey consisting of 463 samples from URT passengers in Nanjing, China, were conducted and analyzed using a random-parameter multinomial logit (RPMNL) model. Results show that socio-economic variables, travel characteristics, travel cost, departure time, and travel distance significantly affect passengers’ route choices. Furthermore, the route choices of passengers with different travelling times and purposes vary. Commuters are most sensitive to travel cost during off-peak periods, followed by non-commuters who travel during peak periods. Departure time and travel distance most significantly affect the route choices of non-commuters during peak periods and off-peak periods, respectively. The findings of this study could assist transit agencies in designing attractive fare incentive policies for public transit passengers and offer valuable insights into effective demand management strategies. Moreover, the lessons derived from this study may guide the implementation of fare incentive policies in Nanjing, China, and elsewhere.",0965-8564,Not found

We then employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model and text network analysis to examine the comments in these significant events to understand the exact reasons for the change in attitudes. The results indicate that the public’s attitude variations are closely linked with social events. Meanwhile, among all topics, Platform and Safety are constant public concerns. Other topics (e.g., Publicity, Government, and Pity) of public concern are related to significant events. The gap between perceived and actual security toward ride-hailing services seems to exist.

In 2020, utilitarian trips, work/school trips, and trips for accessing transit stops replaced recreation trips as the primary trip purpose. The travel distance model shows that e-scooters can help to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by replacing car and ride-hail/taxis trips.

The effect of the ‘yield to pedestrians’ policy on risky pedestrian behaviors: Is it a ‘two-edged sword’?,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103870,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"This study investigates the potential positive and negative effects of the ‘yield to pedestrians’ (YTP) policy on pedestrian risky behaviors based on an extended model of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Two policy-related variables, knowledge about (KN) and perceived effectiveness (PE), were added to the original TPB model. Partial least squares-based structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the relationships between study variables. The results showed that the males and respondents who sometimes/rarely drove were more likely to engage in risky behaviors than the females and respondents who frequently drove. Regarding the effect of YTP on pedestrian behavior, if one acquires more knowledge about the YTP policy, he/she is less likely to engage in risky behavior, possibly because individuals acquire more knowledge about YTP if they are more concerned about traffic safety, that is, a positive effect. Instead, if one perceives the policy more effective, he/she is more likely to engage in risky behavior, possibly because if one perceives the policy as more effective, he/she has a stronger belief that the drivers should yield to pedestrians, that is, a negative effect. Thus, the effect of the YTP policy on pedestrian risky behavior is a ‘two-edged sword.’ Multi-group analysis showed that the relationships between PE and behavioral intention (BI) are significant among males and those who frequently drove. We posit that risky tendencies and knowledge are the underlying factors that affect the relationship between PE and BI. Our concern is that if people acquire more knowledge about YTP, they may perceive the policy as more effective and become more likely to engage in risky behaviors. Thus, we suggest that the propagandizing of the YTP policy and the improvement of pedestrian awareness of traffic safety should be emphasized and strengthened simultaneously to avoid potential negative effect of the YTP policy on avoidance of pedestrian risky behaviors.",0965-8564,Not found
"Covid-19, intentions to change modes, and how they materialized - Results from a random survey of Californians",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103882,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Drawing insights from a random survey of Californians conducted in May 2021, we explore how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted Californians’ preferences for various transportation modes and analyze obstacles to increasing transit use. As COVID-19 disrupted habits and created health concerns for shared modes, many Californians expressed a desire to use transit and transportation network companies less after the pandemic, while intentions for driving were mixed. However, intentions to drive less did not materialize, possibly because the pandemic reinforced Californians’ car use habits, and many firms have been urging their employees to return to the office. Without new incentives and measures that increase the generalized cost of driving, the future of transit appears grim, as the intentions of the 28.9% of Californians 18 and over who intended to use transit less post-COVID (versus only 7.3% who wanted to use it more) appear to be realized. Hispanics, choice riders, and those who intend to telecommute more post-pandemic stated that they would use transit less. A silver lining is the substantial uptick in intentions to walk and bike more (25.9%), with just 8% of Californians stating the opposite. The main reasons Californians would not take transit post-pandemic do not include health concerns and are the same in 2021 as in 2017: a personal vehicle offers more flexibility and convenience. Younger adults, people with more education, and affluent households (the so-called “choice riders”) also deplore transit’s insufficient reach and frequency. Our work underscores the intricate interplay between the pandemic, transportation intentions, and actual behavior.",0965-8564,Not found

"Shared e-scooter service providers with large fleet size have a competitive advantage: Findings from e-scooter demand and supply analysis of Nashville, Tennessee",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103878,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Shared e-scooter systems are one of the fastest-growing micromobility modes in the United States. In response to service providers’ rapid deployment of e-scooter vehicles, several city governments have regulated shared e-scooters through permits and pilot programs, including the number of service providers, their fleet size, and provisions for expanding/downsizing the fleet size. However, the literature lacks an empirical analysis of the demand elasticity of shared e-scooters. We used a Poisson fixed effects regression to evaluate the demand elasticity of e-scooter vehicle deployment using the Shared Urban Mobility Device (SUMD) dataset from Nashville, Tennessee, between March 1, 2019 and February 2020. This dataset included disaggregated e-scooter trip summary data and vehicle location data that updates approximately every five minutes. We also estimated land-use specific demand elasticity of e-scooter vehicle deployment by clustering Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) using the K-means algorithm. We found that the average daily demand elasticity of e-scooter vehicle deployment is inelastic (0.64). Service providers with large fleet sizes (>500 average daily e-scooters) have a demand elasticity of e-scooter deployment that is 1.8 times higher than that of medium fleet-sized service providers (250–500 average daily e-scooters). Fleet size is likely correlated to service provider-specific attributes such as vendor popularity, brand loyalty, and rideshare services. We also found a significant difference in demand elasticity of e-scooter deployment for land use types, with university and park & waterfront land uses having the highest elasticity values. These findings could be helpful for city governments to identify the optimal number of service providers and fleet sizes to permit so that demand is fulfilled without an oversupply of e-scooter vehicles in public spaces.",0965-8564,Not found
A joint machine learning and optimization approach for incremental expansion of electric vehicle charging infrastructure,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103863,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"As Electric vehicle (EV) adoption increases worldwide, public charging infrastructure must be expanded to meet the growing charging demand. Furthermore, insufficient and improperly deployed public charging infrastructure poses a real risk of slowing EV adoption. The infrastructure thus needs to be expanded intelligently and flexibly while accounting for uncertain dynamics in future charging demand. Nevertheless, current methods for demand-based expansion often rely on rigid and error-prone tools, such as travel surveys and simple rules of thumb. The former is more appropriate for long-term, equilibrium scenarios, where we consider the charging network as a whole rather than incrementally expanding it. At the same time, the latter relies on business experience in a rapidly changing field. We propose a predictive optimization approach for intelligent incremental expansion of charging infrastructure. At each time step, we estimate the future charging demand through a Gaussian Process, which is subsequently used in a linear chance-constrained optimization method to expand the charging infrastructure incrementally. To develop and validate this framework, we account for environmental feedback by simulating user behavior changes based on historical charging records and considering an optimized charging network at every iteration. We apply this approach to a case study of EV charging in Dundee, Scotland. We compare different strategies and reasons for their pros and cons for monthly incremental expansion of the charging network. In particular, combining machine learning and optimization results in the cheapest expansion and one that serves the most demand.",0965-8564,Not found
Who to sacrifice?

This study delves into the driver’s dilemma by assessing respondents’ beliefs on whether passengers should be sacrificed to save pedestrians, as well as their willingness to purchase such vehicles. We conducted an original survey that collected approximately 7,000 responses, taking into account factors such as ethical identities, technology familiarity, and practical HAV benefits. Using structural equation models, our findings emphasize the driver’s dilemma, with utilitarianism and co-ridership significantly affecting the decision. Altruists generally favor saving pedestrians; however, altruistic individuals who believe that saving family members in vehicles over ten pedestrians is ethical are more inclined to purchase HAVs that prioritize their family members’ safety, even if it means sacrificing pedestrians. Nonetheless, the majority view protecting pedestrians as the ethical choice, and our results indicate that a social consensus on pedestrian safety could encourage the adoption of ethical HAVs.

Is car traffic close to saturation in France?,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103873,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"After decades of uninterrupted growth, car traffic temporarily levelled off during the 2000′s in France, before coming back to growth after 2008. However, there are reasons to believe that car traffic growth is potentially limited, among which completion of the diffusion process for car ownership, limited travel time budgets, decreasing returns of additional car travel. In this study, we implement a disaggregate model at the household level to project future car ownership and car mileage per household in France, along with total car traffic, accounting for demographic growth. Our model relies on a sequential approach using panel data, with an ordered response probit model for the number of vehicles, including saturation thresholds by vehicle rank, and a log-linear model for car mileage, conditional on the number of vehicles, both with correlated random effects. A time trend is also incorporated to account for the decreasing household car mileage that was noticed over the last twenty years, which is not entirely explained by decreasing household size and the gradual decline of income growth. Assuming this trend to go on, total car traffic in France would grow only a little by 2050, despite demographic growth, and start decreasing from 2040. We discuss these results by questioning the structural nature of this trend.",0965-8564,Not found
Book-ahead ride-hailing trip and its determinants: Findings from large-scale trip records in China,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103875,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"The cruising of ride-hailing vehicles generates negative externalities such as traffic congestion and vehicular emissions. These externalities can be mitigated by reducing cruising driving via operating book-ahead ride-hailing services, where the platform dispatches and routes drivers based on precise information on travelers’ departure time and origin–destination (OD). However, the effects of factors influencing book-ahead ride-hailing trips have rarely been empirically examined with real data. Using six-month trip data from China, this study employs a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) method with hyperparameters optimized by the Bayesian optimization algorithm to examine the factors associated with book-ahead ride-hailing trips across OD pairs (hexagon cells-to-hexagon cells) at various spatial scales. The relative importance rankings generated from this study indicate that trip features, weather conditions, and accessibility to transportation hubs are significant determinants correlated with the usages of book-ahead ride-hailing. The partial dependence plots demonstrate the nonlinear threshold effects of these determinants on the hourly number of book-ahead ride-hailing per OD pair. Moreover, this study compares the differences in associations between peak and non-peak hours as well as weekdays and weekends. The disparity in the nonlinear threshold effects between weekdays and weekends is only observable during the evening peak period and not at other times. These findings provide valuable insights into developing practical strategies for promoting book-ahead ride-hailing services.",0965-8564,Not found
Addressing pedestrian perceived externalities influenced by motor vehicles: A perspective from curb space typologies,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103876,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Pedestrian externalities are usually generated by motor vehicles on urban infrastructure. There is a part of such infrastructure, called curb space, that separates pedestrians from motor vehicles. The literature proposes four main curb space typologies regarding the right-of-way (i.e., no lateral separation, lateral separation with no vertical barriers, lateral separation with vertical barriers, and on-street parking). However, there is little research reporting on how pedestrians perceive the externalities, or on the effects of externalities considering the previously mentioned curb space typologies. The purpose of this study is to identify the influences of externalities on pedestrians from the latter’s perspective and considers their interaction with the built environment. To do so, we collected 1014 pedestrian responses related to their relationship with motor vehicles on 30 different sidewalks and some objective information (e.g., sidewalk width) on those sidewalks. Using a structural equation model approach, we identified a latent variable related with the pedestrian perceived externalities, which was defined based on a multiple indicators and multiple causes model for each of the curb space typologies. It was found that socio-demographic characteristics have a greater influence on the perceived externalities on curb spaces with no vertical barriers. In contrast, for curb spaces with vertical barriers, it is the built environment and operational characteristics that have a greater influence. We also identified the built environment and operational attributes influencing the perceived externalities on each of the curb space typologies. This research provides the tools to propose public policies related to transportation infrastructure interventions to reduce pedestrian perceived externalities.",0965-8564,Not found
Public acceptance of autonomous vehicles: Examining the joint influence of perceived vehicle performance and intelligent in-vehicle interaction quality,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103864,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Many nations' transportation strategies have highlighted the potential of autonomous vehicles and have made plans to slowly phase them into societies over the next decade.

Five hundred valid survey responses from people residing in Singapore were collected and structural equation modeling was utilized to confirm the theoretical model. From the results, all of the identified constructs from UTAUT2 and Computer as Social Actors are significant. The performance expectancy of autonomous vehicles and interaction quality of the intelligent in-vehicle interaction technology also mediate public acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, among the constructs, interaction quality, social influence, and performance expectancy have the greatest total effect on the acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Accordingly, regular feedback sessions must be conducted to ensure consumer-centric improvements in interaction quality and performance expectancy of autonomous vehicles.

Sustainable FLM transport based on IPF transport by ferry in coastal rural areas: A case from Sweden,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103871,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"With the increased emission requirements in Europe over the past century the role of Integrated Passenger and Freight (IPF) transport for sustainable first- and last mile (FLM) transport have increased. IPF transport by ferry has the potential to increase sustainability in FLM transport in coastal rural areas. A literature review followed by a single case study was conducted to examine six core elements of IPF transport by ferry for improvement of environmental, economic, and social- sustainable FLM transport in a Swedish coastal rural areas. In addition to the literature review, empirical data was collected from a total of 346 semi-structured interviews with passengers (i.e., visitors, tourists, residents), goods owners and policymakers, observations (at ferries, piers) and a hackathon. The study show that environmental sustainable FLM transport could be improved by increasing usage of free capacity in ferries, and improved planning of the IPF transport by ferry. The study indicate improved environmental sustainable FLM transport linked to introduction of electrical ferries for IPF transport. Economic sustainable FLM transport related to the long-term viability of IPF transport by ferry could be improved by enhanced compliance between traffic planning programs and the execution of FLM transport in coastal rural areas, and adjustment of passengers' one-way ticket fare of IPF transport. The study suggest introduction of modul-based ferries to improve economic sustainability of FLM transport based on IPF transport by ferry.

Experimental study on the zebra crossing traffic flow characteristics of mixed bicycles and pedestrians,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103865,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Slow transportation mode, consisting of walking and cycling, plays an important role in the urban traffic system. To analyze the influence of additional bicycles on the traffic efficiency of the bicycle-pedestrian mixed group on the zebra crossing, we conducted controlled experiments to study their traffic flow characteristics based on the micro-characteristics of individuals and the macro-effect of bicycle proportion in the mixed group in which bicycles and pedestrians often share the common road facility in some countries. This work constructs a 10 m-long, 3 m-wide passageway to mimic the zebra crossing area. We first extract the head trajectories of cyclists and pedestrians to quantitatively analyze the speed, density, and spatial relationship among them through the videos that record the complete process of the bicycle-pedestrian mixed experiments. Our quantitative results show that increasing the bicycle proportion leads to longer travel and passing time because of the large personal space requirements for cyclists. By analyzing the spatial relationship and recording the forward and lateral distance between the two nearest individuals, an improved theoretical formula is proposed to describe the passing time for unidirectional bicycle-pedestrian mixed flow on zebra crossing and provide traffic efficiency. The analysis indicates that a smaller personal space for cyclists can shorten the passing time effectively. These findings are the first step toward developing bicycle-pedestrian mixed flow on the zebra crossing, which contributes to providing practical implications for planning and designing bicycle and pedestrian shared infrastructures.",0965-8564,Not found
"A simultaneous model of residential location, mobility tool ownership and mode choice using latent variables",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103867,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"This paper investigates the interplay between three key choice dimensions in transport modeling: (i) Residential location, (ii) mobility tool (e.g., car and/or public transport season ticket) ownership and (iii) mode choice. We use a unique panel dataset of recently moved Swiss respondents to better assess the impact of changes in the respective dimensions. An expected trend is that the more accessible the residential location, the more likely the respondent owns a public transport season ticket, and the more likely public transport rather than a car is chosen. However, our model allows to disentangle the decision process and provides a more comprehensive picture of respondents’ behavior. For example, our simple mode choice model shows a strong and positive effect of income on the choice of car. In the simultaneous approach, given respondents’ increase in car ownership for increasing income, this effect becomes even more substantial if the residential location is assumed to be constant. With the latter assumption lifted, however, the effect decreases again, since respondents with higher income tend to live in areas with higher accessibility, lowering their car usage. An important general finding is that if the longer-term decisions (i.e., the choice of residential location and mobility tools) are considered, the short-term effects of level-of-service attributes (such as travel time) on mode choice is substantially weakened by more than 20%.",0965-8564,Not found
A data-driven game theoretic multi-objective hybrid algorithm for the Dial-A-Ride Problem with multiple time windows,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103862,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"The Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP) designs pick-up and delivery routes for a set of customers. It arises in door-to-door transport services tailored to elderly and impaired people. It minimizes operational costs while accommodating as many drivers’ and customers’ constraints as possible; e.g., constraints on transit time and time windows on pick up and drop off. This paper develops a two-layer and a three-layer artificial neural network (ANN) to predict DARP parameters. The ANN is trained with real data provided by a transit agency from the Canadian city/region of Vancouver. Experimental results show that a three-layer ANN with rectified linear activation functions in conjunction with a stochastic gradient descent optimizer provides the most accurate output forecasts. Utilizing the predictions as parameter estimates for a deterministic mean DARP with multiple time windows (DARPMTW), this paper models the problem as a Company-Drivers-Customers’ theoretic game that minimizes the total route duration and maximizes the minimal satisfaction of the drivers and the customers. It shows that non-dominated Pareto feasible solutions satisfy the Nash equilibrium conditions of the game-theoretic model. It then creates a multi-objective hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search (DD-HALNS) to estimate the Pareto front. The multi-objective DD-HALNS algorithm confines its search to feasible solutions that satisfy the Nash equilibrium conditions and employs local search operators based on their success rates. The operators are controlled by a learning mechanism that utilizes previous successful moves, cost savings, and utility maximization. Four hybridization operators are applied, namely Simulated Annealing, Tabu Lists, Genetic Crossover, and Restarts. The results of experiments conducted on real-world DARPMTW instances demonstrate the ability of the multi-objective DD-HALNS to enhance the best-known routing solutions, as well as its implementability.",0965-8564,Not found
Understanding market competition between transportation network companies using big data,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103861,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"As in a typical two-sided market, the competition between transportation network companies (TNCs) can lead to market fragmentation and loss of matching efficiency between passengers and drivers, whereas a monopoly market may result in the dominant TNC abusing its market power. Therefore, whether to encourage or discourage competition between TNCs is a debatable question for cities. Prior studies explored this question mostly through mathematical equilibrium models, but few have comprehensively investigated it based on empirical analysis using real-world data. To fill this gap, this study proposes a framework to measure and analyze the competition between TNCs using the most accessible ride-hailing trip data. Specifically, using an interpretable machine learning model, we investigate how TNCs’ pricing and wage strategies influence their market shares and how competition intensity affects passenger cost and driver income. The results based on large-scale trip records from four TNCs in New York City show that the pricing strategy is more influential than the wage strategy on the market shares and competition intensity. Instead of the top TNC, it is the strategies of challenger TNCs (with sizeable but not the biggest market shares) that affect the competition more. Both the passenger cost and driver income can benefit from competition even after considering the potential loss of matching efficiency, while TNCs’ profits shrink with growing competition intensity. These findings suggest that cities should encourage competition between TNCs, yet within a limit. They add empirical evidence to prior studies and provide implications for regulating TNC competition.",0965-8564,Not found

By applying a difference-in-differences style model on shared e-scooter trip data, changes in demand at new opened stations and closed stations as well as for rentals starting and rentals ending around these public transport stations are estimated. The results clearly show an increase in demand at newly opened stations while demand significantly decreases when a station is closed. This is true for both, starting and ending shared e-scooter trips. Consequently, it can be concluded that public transport acts as complement for shared e-scooters.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper therefore analyses the long-run effects of increasing importance of e-commerce and, more specifically, the impact of a shift towards package delivery via drones. Using a polycentric urban spatial general equilibrium model that incorporates the different retail channels, we model the consumer’s choice between local and online shopping. In the case of online shopping, delivery takes place either via drone or via truck. Due to the equilibrium mechanisms, changes in shopping behavior potentially result in different home and work location choices or labor supply choices. The model thus allows assessing the long-run effects of e-commerce and drone delivery, also on related markets such as the markets for land, labor and goods. A numerical simulation of the model shows that each additional retail channel adds welfare and that changes in the shopping channels result in changes in location choices of households and companies.",0965-8564,Not found

With a fleet of smaller vehicles, DRT provides a much more flexible and convenient service. This characteristic makes DRT also a potential mode of transport to serve students in rural areas. If DRT vehicles are used to serve students, then the funding for conventional school buses (or adapted public transport schedules) can be reinvested in the DRT system. This may help to relieve the financial burden experienced by DRT operators and enable the operation of a large-scale DRT service in rural areas. In this study, a demand model for school commutes based on real-world, open-source data for Landkreis Vulkaneifel, a rural region in Germany, is built.

Two variables gauging car ownership (those with no car) and COVID-19 information channels (received through online sources) produced statistically significant random parameters, which suggests heterogeneous levels of compliance among these groups. In addition, one instance of heterogeneity in the mean of the online sources random parameter was discovered, such that levels of compliance among this group were dependent on a variable gauging highest education level.

Towards analyzing the robustness of the Integrated Global Transportation Network Abstraction (IGTNA),10.1016/j.tra.2023.103838,178,2023-12-01,2023,12,"The well-functioning of our transportation systems is essential for ensuring the mobility of people and goods. According to the Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDG) adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, it is of utmost importance to build and maintain a resilient infrastructure. In terms of transportation systems, a resilient infrastructure guarantees seamless connections and robustness against failures and targeted attacks. Existing studies on small-scale road, subway, or air transportation networks have revealed interesting patterns and phenomena for different parts of the world. These studies, however, are usually either spatially or modal-wise constrained. Most notably this holds for the worldwide airport network, which has frequently been analyzed in the literature. Transportation interactions on the ground are usually considered through aggregation of nodes into either cities or multiple airport regions. This conceptual simplification leaves room for the analysis of an Integrated Global Transportation Network Abstraction (IGTNA), covering aviation and ground transportation on our planet. We believe that it is crucial for planners and analysts to include all infrastructure, assets, networks, modes, and users as a single system. IGTNA enables to model all aspects of interconnectivity at a high-level of details, encoding points of interests as nodes and potential transitions between points of interests as links. Our aggregated network representation of the global transportation system consists of 5.3 million nodes and more than 8.6 million links. We propose scalable data extraction and network dismantling techniques. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to report on the robustness of the IGTNA.

Researchers, policy-makers and advocates have suggested that transportation and land use policies be modified to encourage transit-friendly environments. Despite the importance of studying the relationship between built environment and transit use, previous research on this topic exhibits several limitations in terms of scope, resolution and robustness of research design, due to availability of built environment and ridership data. Using a historical marked crosswalk dataset generated from Google Street View along with longitudinal station-level ridership and built environment data, this paper examines the association between changes in percent of intersections with marked crosswalks, station area built environments, and ridership in 877 TOD stations in the US between 2010 and 2018. Although we confirm ridership is decreasing overall, we find that the addition of high-visibility crosswalks was positively associated with transit ridership changes. However, transit ridership decreased in areas where the proportion of low-income workers increased, whereas percent of zero-vehicle households decreased faster than the national average. The findings suggest that efforts by land use and transportation planners to modify station areas to support higher transit ridership are necessary but likely insufficient to achieve higher ridership. Planning and policy attention to auto ownership and use, and land use-transportation coordination such as providing more affordable housing in TOD station areas, is likely to have beneficial impacts on transit ridership.",0965-8564,Not found
"Investigation of the interaction between urban rail ridership and network topology characteristics using temporal lagged and reciprocal effects: A case study of Chengdu, China",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103922,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"This study investigates the interaction between the network topology characteristics of the urban rail transit (URT) system in Chengdu, China, and the ridership at the station level between 2013 and 2019. In particular, the relationship between a station’s importance, measured in terms of its ordered betweenness centrality (OBC), and its ridership pressure, measured as the number of high ridership days (HRD) a year, is assessed. Seven covariates for socioeconomic attributes, the availability of other modes, land-use conditions, and number of entrances and exits of rail stations are also included. Four hypotheses are proposed to investigate the temporal lagged and reciprocal effects of OBC and HRD on each other. To assess the temporal lagged effects, the study period is divided into two waves: Wave 1 from 2013 to 2016 and Wave 2 from 2016 to 2019. Four generalized structural equation models are combined with cross-lagged panel models to explore the hypothesized causal relationships. The results indicate that a rail station that experiences high ridership is less likely to be topologically important in later years. In contrast, a station with a higher importance ranking is more likely to experience high ridership pressure in later years; however, this relationship is weakened if the reciprocal effect of ridership pressure on the station’s importance is considered. In addition, the causality of the temporal and reciprocal effects indicates that the URT development strategy may affect the interaction between OBC and HRD. The effects of the covariates on OBC and HRD differ between Wave 1 and Wave 2, suggesting that the influence of these covariates varies with the URT development stage.",0965-8564,Not found
The role of travel satisfaction and attitudes toward travel modes in the prospect of adoption of urban air taxis: Evidence from a stated preference survey in Tehran,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103885,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Urban air mobility (UAM) is a new mode of transportation which has the potential to curb congestion in urban areas by providing a fast alternative that bypasses surface-level traffic by employing low altitude urban airspace. However, the successful adoption of this innovation among other modes of transportation remains a critical challenge, as public acceptance plays a pivotal role in the uptake of any emerging technology or service. To transcend traditional ground transportation, it is imperative to investigate the factors that drive a transition from current modes, particularly private cars, to the utilization of urban air taxis (UATs). While prior research has explored different aspects of UAM adoption, there is a notable dearth of studies examining the influence of travel satisfaction and attitudes towards travel modes on the preference for UAM. Notably, existing transportation literature has established that both satisfaction and attitudes significantly shape travel behavior. To achieve this, a stated preference survey was conducted in the Tehran metropolitan area, and a multinomial logit model incorporating latent variables was developed to assess the influence of socio-demographic and psychological factors on UAM adoption in hypothetical scenarios with predetermined travel times and costs. The findings highlight the pivotal role of service cost and affordability, with individuals of higher incomes exhibiting a significant inclination toward UAT adoption. The adoption of UAT is significantly higher when the cost is comparable to the existing modes. Moreover, satisfaction components, specifically enjoyment and time-saving benefits, exert a significant influence on UAT preference. Unfavorable perceptions towards private cars and ride-hailing services positively contribute to the likelihood of preferring UAT, with a greater impact observed for negative attitudes towards ride-hailing. The study explicitly underscores the influence of travel satisfaction and attitudes towards conventional modes of transportation on the adoption of innovative alternatives such as air taxis within the context of mode choice scenarios.",0965-8564,Not found
Public perception of autonomous vehicle capability determines judgment of blame and trust in road traffic accidents,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103887,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Road accidents involving autonomous vehicles (AVs) will not only introduce legal challenges over liability distribution but also generally diminish the public trust that may make itself manifested in slowing the initial adoption of the technology and call into question the continued adoption of the technology. Understanding the public’s reactions to such incidents, especially the way they differentiate from conventional vehicles, is vital for future policy-making and legislation, which will in turn shape the landscape of the autonomous vehicle industry. In this paper, intuitive judgments of blame and trust were investigated in simulated scenarios of road-traffic accidents involving either autonomous vehicles or human-driven vehicles. In an initial study, five of six scenarios showed more blame and less trust attributed to autonomous vehicles, despite the scenarios being identical in antecedents and consequences to those with a human driver. In one scenario this asymmetry was sharply reversed; an anomaly shown in a follow-up experiment to be dependent on the extent to which the incident was more likely to be foreseeable by the human driver. More generally these studies show—rather than being the result of a universal higher performance standard against autonomous vehicles—that blame and trust are shaped by stereotypical conceptions of the capabilities of machines versus humans applied in a context-specific way, which may or may not align with objectively derived state of affairs. These findings point to the necessity of regularly calibrating the public’s knowledge and expectation of autonomous vehicles through educational campaigns and legislative measures mandating user training and timely disclosure from car manufacturers/developers regarding their product capabilities.",0965-8564,Not found
Constraint-Based snowplow optimization model for winter maintenance operations,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103911,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"In the annual winter route maintenance, transportation agencies often deploy multiple fleets of trucks for snow control and removal activities over a vast maintenance area which creates an operational problem in determining the optimal maintenance routes and fleet size. The objective of this paper is to develop a snowplow routing optimization model to enhance the efficiency of snow removal route planning. The routing optimization model was developed using vehicle routing problems, constraint-based programming, and geographic information system. The developed model was applied to optimize the snow removal route planning practice of a District in Kansas, United States, as a case study. The result of this study shows that the optimization model can help minimize the fleet size and increase the level of service for treating snow routes within the selected District.

Impact of omitted variable and simultaneous estimation endogeneity in choice-based revenue management systems,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103933,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The demand models used in revenue management systems applied to air transport are affected by endogeneity. This effect is particularly important in the Discrete Choice Models used in Choice Based Revenue Management (CBRM). Still, the sources and the magnitude of the problem have not been completely studied. In this study, we use simulations to analyze the effect of endogeneity in CBRM air transport applications. We replicate different conditions that generate endogeneity described in the literature: the omission of explanatory variables in the behavioral model and the simultaneous determination between fares and demand. On the one hand, results show that simultaneous determination endogeneity is not a concern if the behavioral model includes complete information of the process, without omitting variables. On the other hand, endogeneity affects the estimation and application of CBRM when variables are omitted, a situation that worsens when the omission of variables is combined with the simultaneous determination between fares and demand. Based on these results, we discuss some practical implications and derive some recommendations for the use of CBRM in air transport.",0965-8564,Not found
Pivoting from a known base when predicting choices using logit models,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103869,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Logit models are widely used by transport practitioners for forecasting. It is important that such models make appropriate use of existing independent base data, a process often referred to as “pivoting” and recommended by the UK Department for Transport’s Transport Appraisal Guidance. In the transport context, such base data typically relates to mode and destination shares. The general aim of pivoting is to produce a forecast under changed circumstances while maintaining compatibility with a reliable base position. Various methods for pivoting are available, and the paper investigates three of them in the context of different logit models (MNL, NL and CNL), illustrating them using a simple example of mode and destination choice. For the simplest MNL model, the three methods are essentially equivalent, but they start to diverge as the models become more complex. Although it will not always be the most convenient approach, depending on the software implementation, the “residual disutility” method would seem to be able to deal satisfactorily with all the cases investigated. It is recommended that software be developed to deal with some of the currently less tractable cases.",0965-8564,Not found
The cost impacts of Fit for 55 on shipping and their implications for Swedish freight transport,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103894,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"This paper analyzes the European Commission’s (EC) climate policy package ‘Fit for 55′ and its potential impact on cargo ships calling at Swedish ports. Three scenarios are evaluated using the Swedish national freight transport model. The Main Scenario is based on the EC’sproposal to i) include ships weighing at least 5,000 gross tons (GT) in the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), and to ii) introduce a tax on marine fuel. The Low Scenario includes the EC’s EU ETS proposal but assumes no tax on marine fuel, whilst the High Scenario includes the fuel tax but assumes that ships weighing at least 400 GT are included in the EU ETS. Results show that the EC’s EU ETS proposal excludes 44% of the cargo ships and 22% of the CO2 emissions, and even more so given the use of smaller ships to avoid the EU ETS, as indicated by the freight transport model. The High Scenario implies shifts to larger ships since the increase in fuel costs provides incentives to make useeconomies of scale. Shifts to other transport modes are estimated to be marginal. A policy conclusion is therefore to include smaller ships than 5,000 GT in the EU ETS to further internalize the CO2 costs from cargo ships.",0965-8564,Not found
Optimal policy for scheduling automated guided vehicles in large-scale intelligent transportation systems,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103910,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Automated electric mobility technologies have been increasingly applied to large-scale intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) to enhance productivity and efficiency. Advanced technologies have reshaped the traditional transportation systems and posed numerous challenges to the deployment and management of new ITSs. A major challenge in the real-life implementation of ITSs is how to manage a large number of automated objects in a cooperative manner. In this paper, we investigate the scheduling and routing problem of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in a complicated ITS. Cost and efficiency are identified as the two crucial performance indicators of such a novel ITS. An easy-to-implement practical decision policy and a tailored particle swarm based solution method are designed for problem solving.

Flight ticket taxes in Europe: Environmental and economic impact,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103892,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"We examine the causal impact of flight ticket taxes on airline flights and derived CO2 emissions and analyse its distributional effects between airlines and travellers and within travellers. We use a dataset on flights within Europe at the airline-route level and apply a staggered difference-in-differences approach considering potential bias of the standard two-way fixed effects and the potential distorting effects of heterogeneities between treated and control routes. The main analysis focuses on low-cost airlines because connecting passengers are typically excluded from the tax. We find that flight ticket taxes have a significant overall effect on low-costs airlines supply and derived emissions: ticket taxes reduce the number of flights per airline-route by 12% on average compared to the counterfactual scenario, resulting in a 14% reduction in carbon emissions. In addition, we estimate a pricing equation using a quantile model to identify the cost pass-through rate over the distribution of the fare variable. The burden of the tax is higher for passengers paying low fares, so taxes have a stronger effect on avoidable flights with less added value and a smaller internalization of the total costs of flying.",0965-8564,Not found
Analyzing the impact of fare-free public transport policies on crowding patterns at stations using crowdsensing data,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103944,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Fully or partially fare-free public transport (FFPT) is a measure to make public transport (PT) more attractive and affordable. Cities worldwide are experimenting with a variety of fare discount policies, which will lead to spatiotemporal changes in mobility patterns, including crowding in PT stations. However, the response of PT stations to these policies can vary due to the heterogeneity in their surrounding built environment and other factors. Non-conventional data sources could be used to better model and understand these spatiotemporal dynamics. In this study, we propose a three-step methodological framework to understand the impact of FFPT or extreme fare discount interventions on PT demand patterns, specifically focusing on crowding patterns in PT stations, using crowdsensing data. First, we design a busyness-based similarity measure that leverages the histogram method to capture changes in crowding patterns. Then, we employ a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to cluster PT stations based on their crowding pattern deviations at different stages of policy implementation. This clustering step enables the identification of distinct station types based on their response to the policy. Finally, we train a LightGBM model to learn the relationship between crowding pattern changes and the spatial–temporal characteristics of PT stations, using the busyness-based station types identified by GMM as labels. We apply our methodology to a public transport experiment in Germany during the summer of 2022 when the country introduced a monthly “9-EUR” ticket valid on local and regional PT nationwide. The clustering results show three station types: unaffected, mildly stimulated, and intensely stimulated stations. Furthermore, the classifier indicates that the station’s location, activity options near the station, and population within the adjacent area of the station, and the crowding patterns under normal operations (before policy implementation) play a significant role in the heterogeneity of the 9-EUR ticket’s impact. The insights gained from our study can help planners better understand and manage the crowding at PT stations during fare interventions.",0965-8564,Not found
Transportation resilience under Covid-19 Uncertainty: A traffic severity analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103947,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Transportation systems are critical lifelines and vulnerable to various disruptions, including unforeseen social events such as public health crises, and have far-reaching social impacts such as economic instability. This paper aims to determine the key factors influencing the severity of traffic accidents in four different stages during the pre- and the post Covid-19 pandemic in Illinois, USA. For this purpose, a Random Forest-based model is developed, which is combined with techniques of explainable machine learning. The results reveal that during the pandemic, human perceptual factors, notably increased air pressure, humidity and temperature, play an important role in accident severity. This suggests that alleviating driver anxiety, caused by these factors, may be more effective in curbing crash severity than conventional road condition improvements. Further analysis shows that the pandemic leads notable shifts in residents' daily travel time and accident-prone spatial segments, indicating the need for increased regulatory measures.

Use of passive data for determining link level long distance trips,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103950,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Long-distance trips include a high value of time compared to short-distance trips; thus, capturing long-distance trips contributes to substantial economic and social benefits. This study utilizes privacy-protected travel data collected from mobile devices in Maryland to identify the link-level proportion of long-distance vehicle trips. We propose applying existing econometric frameworks, i.e., the generalized linear and beta regression models, to predict these link-level long-distance trips. Among the covariates, we utilize highway network-level attributes from the Maryland statewide travel demand model (MSTM), employment, and other open-source datasets available for the state of Maryland. Both the econometric models were compared for their performance in multiple measures like validation, behavioral interpretation, and goodness of fit. The best model results indicate a positive relationship between the proportion of long-distance trips and link attributes, like functional class, speed, and surrounding household density.

Optimization of the location and capacity of shared multimodal mobility hubs to maximize travel utility in urban areas,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103934,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Nowadays, urban areas are exposed to various challenges such as climate change, social inequalities, and congestion. Shared mobility hubs present the opportunity to reshape our cities and mitigate the previously mentioned challenges by contributing to a more sustainable transport system. These are places where shared cars, mopeds, and e-bikes are offered to improve connectivity in urban areas. In this paper, we investigate the impact of efficiently allocating multimodal shared mobility hubs on modal split, service level, and environmental factors while assuring economic feasibility. Given a limited budget, cities would like to optimize the hubs’ locations to maximize the population’s benefits. For that purpose, we introduce a multi-stage design algorithm model that distributes the hubs and allocates fleets of shared cars, mopeds, and e-bikes to maximize travel utility for all the population traveling using traditional and/or shared modes while accounting for multimodal trips. The model is divided into several modules: computational modules that calculate the demand for the hubs; an optimization module to optimize the hubs’ capacities, availability, and relocation of shared vehicles; and finally, a genetic algorithm to find the optimal hub distribution. Our proposed model is one of the first that optimizes the location and capacity of multimodal hubs by considering multimodal trips in a large network. Additionally, it allows to assess mobility, spatial, and environmental impact of shared modes. The model is applied to the case of Amsterdam, the capital of The Netherlands, with around 800,000 inhabitants. After running several scenarios with different budgets allocated to build the hubs, results show that having more hubs with a lower number of shared vehicles is more beneficial than having fewer hubs with higher capacity. That is because the travel time savings increase considerably when investments lead to complete coverage of the area by the hubs network. A modal split of 5% for the shared modes is expected when Amsterdam is covered by 288 hubs. From an environmental point of view, only 32% of the shared trips replace trips previously made by ICE and electric cars, leading to a limited CO2 emissions reduction of 1.27%. Hence, introducing shared modes and mobility hubs without push measures for the use of private cars appears to offer limited benefits to decrease the negative impacts of private car usage.",0965-8564,Not found
A novel route-based accessibility measure and its association with transit ridership,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103916,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Transit systems play a key role in improving access to job opportunities and basic services such as health and education. Most studies in the literature calculate transit accessibility using traditional place-based indicators that measure accessibility at a given location. However, because transit routes are the main unit of analysis in most approaches for planning and operation of transit systems, these accessibility indicators provide limited information to inform transport planning at the route-level. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated the methodological limitations of traditional place-based accessibility metrics to study the association between accessibility and transit ridership. In this paper, we propose a novel route-based accessibility measure to fill the mentioned gaps. The indicator measures the average level of access to opportunities provided by a given transit route to the population in its extended catchment area. This indicator is flexible enough that it can be calculated using different travel cost functions and can be applied to measure access to different activity types for the whole population or for specific groups. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed indicator, we calculated the employment accessibility provided by all routes of the transit system of Fortaleza, Brazil. We also show that the proposed indicator has greater predictive power of transit ridership than other route-level accessibility measures found in the literature. This paper provides a methodological contribution that could help transport planners incorporate accessibility analysis into transit system redesign projects, and help practitioners anticipate what accessibility impacts and subsequent changes in transit ridership could be expected from route-level service changes, and to examine the influence of accessibility on transit ridership.",0965-8564,Not found

The vehicle charging decision-making process is explicitly modeled, and the charging need of each EV user is estimated associated with their travel trajectories. The methodology enables charging demand prediction with a high spatial–temporal resolution for transportation system electrification planning.

Modeling dynamic travel mode choices using cumulative prospect theory,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103938,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Travelers’ mode choice behavior is jointly influenced by their attributes, such as personal income, vehicle ownership, and travel purpose, and external factors, such as the built environment and traffic state. The mode chosen by a traveler before a trip may change during the trip due to uncertainties associated with transportation systems. A cumulative prospect theory-based dynamic mode choice model that describes the changes in decisions at different travel stages is proposed to investigate the within-trip mode-shifting behavior during daily travel. The journey duration or travel time of a trip is divided into a series of stages, which includes the access or connection time (i.e., the time required for the traveler to reach the station or vehicle), waiting time, in-vehicle time, and parking time. The generalized travel cost includes the expense cost, time cost, and penalty cost. The penalty cost is expressed as a negative exponential function with respect to the punctuality satisfaction rating. A novel method is proposed for calculating the mode choice possibility in terms of the changes in travel cost during a trip, in which the psychological weights at different stages are reflected by the ratio of the actual travel time to the expected travel time. Data from a journey survey involving 637 respondents in Beijing were used to test the model. The results of a random parameter logit model reveal the main influencing factors of each travel mode, and show that economic strategies can influence the mode choice of 77.94% of travelers. The dynamic mode choice model predicted the pre-trip mode and mode shift with accuracies of 90.05% and 67.86%, respectively, both of which are higher than those of the expected utility theory-based model. Moreover, the results show that mode-shifting behaviors during a trip generally occur in public transit mode and/or active travel mode. The study results demonstrate the dynamic characteristic and quantitative change in mode choice behavior in multi-mode daily travel and are beneficial for the study of travel behavior in relation to the traffic environment.",0965-8564,Not found
The role of fiscal policies in supporting a transition to a low-carbon economy: Evidence from the Chinese shipping industry,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103940,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The Green Economy Initiative aims to grow our economy without increasing carbon emissions, requiring all industries to transition to a low-carbon economy.

Then a vector autoregression model is developed to test their bidirectional dynamic relationships between fiscal policies and low-carbon transition. We find that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between tax-based policies and low-carbon transition, transfer payment policies have an N-shaped effect on low-carbon transition, and the digital technology application plays a strong moderating role, reducing the negative impact of fiscal policies, and accelerating low-carbon transition in the shipping industry.

A composite index for the evaluation of sustainability in Latin American public transport systems,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103939,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Latin American public transport (PT) systems are the backbone of urban transport with high ridership levels but at the same time, they face substantial deficits in terms of their sustainability. No comprehensive framework for PT sustainability assessment exists so far that is tailored to the specific local situation in this region. Therefore, this study develops for the first time a theoretically sound and feasible index for assessing the sustainability of PT systems in Latin America, the Sustainable Public Transport Index for Latin America (SPTI-LATAM). The index is based on an Assessment Indicator Model (AIM) with overall 49 indicators in the five dimensions system effectiveness, social, environmental, economic, governance and integrated transport planning. The SPTI-LATAM is designed with three levels: 1) the basic index (BSPTI) containing 32 indicators; 2) the extended index (ESPTI) including 11 additional indicators; and 3) the global index (GSPTI) with 6 additional indicators. The BSPTI is computed for eleven case study cities to demonstrate its feasibility and to analyze the sustainability of PT systems in the region. The framework uses the Equal Weighting Aggregation (EWA) method for assigning weights to each indicator, the Weighted Sum Model (WSM) for aggregating the indicators to the overall index and international standards and benchmarks for normalization. The final scores of the BSPTI show that the case study cities have still challenges to reach sustainability since only two cities had scores slightly higher than the half of achievable points (55 and 51), while eight cities had scores between 40 and 50 points, and one city achieved 39 points. Deficits are identified mainly for PT service quality, for the environmental performance, for the governance dimension and less for PT system coverage. Overall, the analysis of the BSPTI-LATAM for the 11 case study cities shows that the index is suitable for benchmarking sustainability of local PT systems and ready to be used in research and practice.",0965-8564,Not found
"An E-scooter route assignment framework to improve user safety, comfort and compliance with city rules and regulations",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103930,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The rapid expansion of dockless shared micromobility systems, particularly dockless e-scooters, presents major opportunities along with challenges that have led some cities to ban these services within their jurisdiction. The safe reintroduction of dockless shared micromobility services requires support through enhancement of e-scooter service implementation, improvement of rider behavior, and enforcement of rules and regulations. This paper develops the micromobility guidance tool (MGT) that guides a shared micromobility user going from a defined origin to a defined destination to a route that meets multiple criteria, including safety, comfort, and compliance. Thus, this tool emphasizes two network features, the type of infrastructure and the condition of infrastructure. Moreover, the tool locates shared micromobility parking that is closest to a user’s destination and sends alerts to avoid prohibited infrastructure types. For each trip, the proposed tool uses a shortest path routing algorithm to assign its route and the Euclidean distance to assign closest parking. A generalized cost function was developed to estimate the time needed to cross a link while considering e-scooter accessibility, user routing preferences, and ordinance restrictions. The effectiveness of MGT was tested through a case study of tens of thousands of dockless shared e-scooter trips within the City of Dallas, TX. As a validation step, several experiments were carried out to examine the developed tool under various scenarios. Routes generated by MGT were compared to actual routes taken by users and to scenarios corresponding to models previously published in the literature. When compared to actual routes taken by riders, case-study findings showed a notable increase in the use of preferred types of infrastructure (bike lanes, sidewalks, one-way roads, etc.), the use of bike infrastructure (bike lanes and bike trails), and the use of better conditions (i.e., less deficient infrastructure). Additionally, a marked reduction in regulatory violations was exhibited. The methodological approach presented here could be generalized to any city network or shared micromobility system. The proposed tool could be required by cities and adopted by shared micromobility providers seeking to improve rider safety, comfort, and compliance. This tool could be integrated into the provider application guiding the user to micromobility-friendly routes and designated parking, a feature not yet available to micromobility users. Finally, this paper has offered policy recommendations and guidance for practice, where the reintroduction of shared e-scooters is being considered by cities and expansion considered in new markets.",0965-8564,Not found
Predictors of electric vehicle adoption intent in rideshare drivers relative to commuters,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103943,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Research examining electric vehicle (EV) adoption intent is growing, but neglects rideshare drivers (e.g., Uber & Lyft), who drive up to 13% of all miles driven in metropolitan areas. This study uses Noppers’ framework on sustainable innovation adoption to compare rideshare drivers to commuters on symbolic and instrumental attribute (e.g., costs, maintenance) perceptions, and their influences on EV adoption intent. It is possible that rideshare drivers have stronger symbolic attribute ratings than commuters because more people see their vehicles for extended periods of time, so what the vehicle signals about drivers may be more salient to drivers; alternatively, because rideshare drivers use their vehicles for work, drivers may perceive vehicles in primarily instrumental terms. We test these competing hypotheses using a survey of 136 rideshare drivers and 378 commuters. Relative to commuters, rideshare drivers rated symbolic attributes higher and EV maintenance costs somewhat more favorably, but significantly fewer had access to a charging spot. A regression model found that both instrumental and symbolic attributes positively predicted EV adoption intent for both groups. Relative to commuters, symbolic attributes were weaker predictors of EV adoption intent among rideshare drivers, whereas instrumental attributes, particularly perceptions that the purchase cost of an EV was lower than that of a gasoline car, were stronger.",0965-8564,Not found

A multiple discrete–continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model is estimated to represent the number of one-way trips undertaken weekly with different purposes (commuting, work-related, education, shopping, personal business/social recreation), and by different modes (car, public transport, active modes). Explanatory variables include socioeconomic characteristics, location, the time period during the pandemic (i.e., waves). In addition, latent variables were included representing underlying attitudes such as satisfaction towards life or concern about the use of public transport – which might certainly play an important role in understanding individual weekly travel behaviour decisions. The model structure has the advantage that it estimates commuting and non-commuting activity together, allowing for a substitution effect between them. The results suggest that across all waves and jurisdictions, respondents who WFH more are more likely to have a higher number of shopping trips and personal business/social recreation trips, perhaps substituting these trips in replacement of their lesser commuting trips. Interestingly, all other influences held constant, individuals who are more concerned about the use of public transport are more likely to undertake commuting trips by all modes, more likely to do shopping trips, and less likely to undertake personal business/social recreation trips – suggesting they are prioritising essential trips rather than social/personal trips and perceive the risk of COVID-19 to be higher due to this travel.",0965-8564,Not found
"Impact of “keep left” measure on pedestrians, cyclists and e-scooter riders at a crossing of a signalised junction",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103942,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"On a signalised crossing of a junction, large bidirectional flows of pedestrians, cyclists and e-scooter (ES) riders would converge and interact with each other in a confined space over a short time interval during each signal-enabled crossing stage. Such shared space interaction has hardly been researched. We experimented with a measure that encourages pedestrians’ “keep left” behaviour while promoting channelisation between pedestrians versus cyclists/ES riders. The impact of the treatment was examined by intercept perception survey and naturalistic observations of trajectory movements via video analysis. The findings showed that pedestrians adopted better keep-left discipline after the treatment, which consequently reduced their perceived conflict levels with other oncoming traffic agents on the crossing which increased their crossing speed. Cyclists and ES riders also indicated lower conflict levels when pedestrian movements on the crossing become more predictable.",0965-8564,Not found
"A matter of space and perspective – Cyclists’, car drivers’, and pedestrians’ assumptions about subjective safety in shared traffic situations",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103941,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Subjective safety has been considered a key factor for a successful promotion of cycling. As of yet, subjective safety and the factors affecting it have been studied almost exclusively from the cyclists’ perspective. However, subjective safety is largely determined by the interaction of cyclists with other road users. We thus argue that it is crucial to assess the subjective safety different road user groups associate with shared road situations, because street designs that increase the subjective safety of one group may have negative impacts on the subjective safety of another group. For this purpose, we conducted a large-scale, web-based survey presenting computer-generated 2D images showing various traffic situations. The entire pool of images included 1,900 variations and combinations of road designs. About 21,500 individual participants provided about 460,000 estimates with regard to the safety they associated with travelling at the shown location from the perspective of cyclists, car drivers, or pedestrians. Our analysis with generalized mixed models focused on three base scenarios and the comparison of the different perspectives: Side streets were perceived as unsafe by both cyclists and car drivers. A prominent designation as a cycling boulevard had highly positive effects, especially for cyclists. On main streets, cyclists and car drivers rated mixed traffic without cycling infrastructure as very unsafe, and situations with cyclists travelling on protected bike lanes as very safe. Whereas car drivers rated all types of cycling lanes as safe, this did not generally apply to cyclists. In particular, narrow cycling lanes adjacent to parked cars felt unsafe for cyclists. We hypothesize that this discrepancy has a self-reinforcing mechanism: Research on risk-taking suggests that the low risk perception of car drivers leads to more risky behavior (e.g. overtaking cyclists with higher speed and less lateral clearance), which in turn decreases the subjective safety of cyclists. We found an inverted pattern for sidewalks, where cyclists felt mostly safe, and the more vulnerable pedestrians did not (especially if there was no clear indication of lanes for both groups). Taken together, our research sheds light on an as-of-yet rather under-researched issue: the perception of a traffic situation may vary significantly depending on the perspective and transportation mode of a road user. More specifically, our findings suggest that the subjective safety of vulnerable road users in a traffic situation can be negatively affected by the perception of this situation by the less vulnerable road users. We present recommendations about road designs that feel safe for all road user groups.",0965-8564,Not found
Contextual Bayesian optimization of congestion pricing with day-to-day dynamics,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103927,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Congestion pricing is a common approach to alleviate urban traffic congestion. The design of second-best congestion pricing schemes is typically formulated as non-linear programming and bi-level optimization problems, where the lower-level problem involves either a static or dynamic network equilibrium model. The complexity of these bi-level toll optimization problems increases considerably when incorporating day-to-day dynamic models of travel behavior and dynamic models of network congestion. These models are often operationalized using simulation, and consequently, the toll design problem is a computationally challenging simulation-based optimization problem where the evaluation of a single candidate pricing scheme involves simulating the day-to-day model until convergence. In order to circumvent this issue, we propose a contextual Bayesian optimization (BO) framework, where the BO scheme is embedded within the day-to-day dynamic model by using temporal contextual information. The framework implicitly incorporates the relationship between the objective function across days and uses past days’ observations (function evaluations) as weak priors when constructing the Gaussian process underlying the BO algorithm for the current day’s toll optimization problem, resulting in gains in computational efficiency. The contextual BO approach is applied to the design of distance-based pricing schemes for the morning commute problem. We demonstrate numerically that the scheme converges to the system optimum, and moreover, utilizes a significantly smaller number of simulation evaluations (ten-fold reduction) than the standard approach wherein each function evaluation involves simulating the day-to-day model until convergence. From a policy perspective, we find that the distance-based schemes yield significant welfare gains relative to area-based schemes and show that the design of the distance-based tariff scheme can significantly affect distributional impacts. A suitably designed two-part tariff structure can partially offset the relatively large welfare losses of travelers with longer commute distances while maintaining overall welfare. The proposed contextual BO scheme is also extended to incorporate context specific demand and supply information, which can be of value to policy-makers when evaluating optimal toll design schemes under a wide range of scenarios in a computational tractable manner.",0965-8564,Not found
The impact of financial incentives on the total cost of ownership of electric light commercial vehicles in EU countries,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103936,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Many EU countries have used financial incentives to promote electric light commercial vehicles and decarbonise urban freight transport. However, the high costs of electric light commercial vehicles still pose a significant adoption barrier. This paper evaluates the impact of financial incentives on the total cost of ownership of electric light commercial vehicles in the European Union and their role in achieving the cost-competitiveness of electric vehicles. A pairwise comparison is performed for three weight categories of electric and diesel vehicles in twelve countries. Our analysis shows that financial incentives have a high impact on the total cost of ownership and have proven necessary to achieve electric vehicles' cost-competitiveness in most cases. However, in specific cases, financial incentives may no longer be needed as the cost of electric vehicles' ownership would have been lower than diesel vehicles even without them. This paper demonstrates the importance of adjusting government incentives to avoid unnecessary funding allocations while promoting the decarbonisation of light commercial vehicles, particularly as the number of incentives does not directly correlate with electric vehicles penetration.",0965-8564,Not found
"Analysis of spatiotemporal transit accessibility and transit inequity of essential services in low-density cities, a case study of Nashville, TN",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103931,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Evaluating the accessibility and equity of transit services to essential services that fulfill people’s fundamental needs is critical, especially in lower-density areas with limited transit services. Although numerous studies have analyzed the inequity of transit accessibility in dense, urban areas with robust transit networks, few of them evaluated transit inequity across multiple essential service categories (e.g., food stores, healthcare facilities, schools, etc.). This paper fills this research gap by focusing on a low-density, automobile-oriented city (Nashville, TN) to evaluate spatial transit inequities across essential service deserts and sociodemographic groups. The results of the case study show that many areas with higher transit-dependent demand (i.e., populations with limited personal vehicles, those living in poverty, and minority populations) tend to experience more restricted transit access to food, healthcare, school, and childcare facilities; interestingly, this is not the case for transit access to green space (specifically, parks). This study further identified essential service deserts by Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) clustering and analyzed the correlation among them. The correlation results suggest that food deserts, healthcare deserts, school deserts, and childcare deserts are highly correlated with each other, while they have a lower correlation with park deserts. The findings of spatial transit inequity and the identification of essential service deserts provide crucial policy implications that can be used by transit agencies and local planning departments to prioritize their resources and target interventions to improve transit equity. This study contributes to the existing literature by proposing a systematic process that utilizes publicly available datasets to measure spatiotemporal transit supply, identify essential service deserts, and explore the correlation among these areas in a low-density city.",0965-8564,Not found
Public transport route choice modelling: Reducing estimation bias when using smart card data,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103929,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data for public transport analyses has received much research interest recently, including its use for the estimation of passenger route choice preferences. However, an important problem persists since AFC data only includes information about the trip within the public transport system, that is stop-to-stop (tap-in to tap-out). Not knowing the full trip from door-to-door might lead to estimation bias, especially when estimating route choice models based on only the chosen stops, which is common practice in current research using AFC data. To avoid this, we propose an improved method for estimating route choice models in public transport using AFC data. The method is based on randomly generating pseudo origin (and destination) points in close vicinity of the actually chosen origin (and destination) stops, thus allowing pseudo access and egress times to be incorporated into the route choice model. The framework is compatible with any probability density function. We suggest using the Beta distribution for generating points when knowledge about access and egress distances are available, whereas the Uniform distribution is suggested when no knowledge is available. The method was applied on replicated AFC data based on traditional travel survey data from the Greater Copenhagen area in Denmark. The results of the model estimations confirm estimation bias in parameter estimates when not correcting for the lack of access/egress information. The proposed method notably improves in-vehicle-time parameter estimates of the route choice model compared to estimation assuming AFC stop-to-stop data, whereas access/egress time and hidden waiting time parameters are still biased, although to a lesser extent than a traditional naïve estimation based on stop-to-stop data.",0965-8564,Not found
Do women perceive pedestrian path attractiveness differently from men?,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103890,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The objective of this work is investigating on differences in pedestrians’ perceptions in terms of gender. Specifically, we want to verify differences between male and female in perceiving aspects characterizing pedestrian paths and influencing their satisfaction, perceived service quality, and behavioural intentions. We propose a methodology based on Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. From the model calibration we derived different coefficients for male and female, representing the importance that each category of users gives to the various aspects characterizing the paths. Data were collected through a sample survey addressed to pedestrians walking on paths placed in an urban area of the southern Italy. We discovered interesting findings about gender differences. In general, females are more sensitive than males concerning many important aspects such as environmental aspects in terms of air pollution and noise, or personal security from robbery or theft, or presence of furnishing along the path and cleanliness of the environment. On the other hand, male consider more the continuity of pedestrian path and the condition of the walking surface, as well as the nuisance due to the vehicle flow. In terms of similarities in perceptions, male and female equally appreciated the comfort due to the presence of trees providing shade along the path. The findings from the model could be useful for planners, who should invest on those aspects considered as important by both the categories, but also on the aspects that determine an inequality between male and female. As an example, since women do not feel secure along those paths, planners could improve this aspect in such a way as to make paths attractive to both women and men, as well as the aspects considered more relevant for men, to incentivize pedestrian mobility.",0965-8564,Not found
Autonomous vehicle market development in Beijing: A system dynamics approach,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103889,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"A system dynamics (SD) model for the autonomous vehicles (AVs) market development in Beijing is proposed. The model approaches the vehicle scale evolution with the marketization development of private AVs and shared AVs. Some potential factors such as trust, AV purchase willingness, AV using willingness and shared AV service accessibility, are analyzed. Based on the passenger vehicle situation in Beijing, optimistic scenarios from 2014 to 2050 are developed. The base scenario involves the marketization of private AVs and the operation of shared AV fleets, and based on the levels of driving automation, which are divided into six types. The causal feedback relationship and system flow diagram are illustrated. Results show that with the introduction of AVs in Beijing, the number of private vehicles is significantly decreased, which is dependent on the use of shared AVs. To compare with the private vehicle ownership in 2020, the total number of private vehicles has decreased and the number of the private vehicles is over 2.2 million vehicles in 2050. After 2030, the shared vehicle fleet will be dominated by the high-level shared AV and the number of high-level shared AVs is about 2 million. Further, to consider the impact of ride-sharing, the model compares the different attitudes for customers to share their rides and use the shared AV alternative ratio to approach this. The result shows that the extreme ratio will reduce the number of shared AVs, and the fleet size of shared vehicle is about 400,000 vehicles in 2050. For the low ratio scenario, the fleet size of shared vehicle will increase a lot to over 3,186,000 vehicles, which will lead to a large number of cars on the road and thus increase congestion. The introduction of AVs is expected to reduce the number of private vehicles; However, the uncertainty of residents' attitudes towards car sharing will affect the introduction of AVs. At present, the existing policies prefer to limit the number of vehicles by controlling car registration in Beijing. In the future, with the application of AVs, this could be adjusted by encouraging ride sharing, to achieve sustainable urban transport development in Beijing.",0965-8564,Not found

Over the sample period 2017–2020 we observe four different tolling regimes, with changing tolling costs for peak and off-peak driving in Oslo for different types of cars. We employ both fixed-effects regression and production analysis combined with difference-in-difference methods to analyze effects of cordon policies on driving. The empirical results show that peak and off-peak driving are complementary goods, and consequently that increasing peak tolls can decrease off-peak-driving. Responsiveness varies significantly by geographical location and age, with more responsiveness to the tolls closer to the city center and from elderly drivers. Also, the most noticeable response from the drivers under consideration is shifting more of their driving to the hour before the morning peak charge starts.",0965-8564,Not found

Two arguments that point in opposing directions have been presented in the literature: long distance users induce larger operators’ costs while short distance users induce larger in-vehicle times. Here we formulate a stylized model of a corridor where these and other elements are taken into account to approach the optimal strategic design (frequency, vehicle size, and route length) and its associated optimal pricing problem considering identical users that travel different distances. A crucial element is the consideration of the crowding caused by passengers entering the system at different points along the corridor, affecting the value of in-vehicle time which increases with the load factor through a crowding factor that, ultimately, is the single element that triggers optimal prices that increase with distance at a decreasing rate.",0965-8564,Not found
An analysis of the context factors influencing the diverse response of airports to COVID-19 using panel and group regression,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103925,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Since 2020, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to various levels of recovery across different aviation markets. To better plan for the future, post-pandemic era, air transport policies should consider the potential differential responses of airports to the pandemic based on their geographic network and competitive situations. Much literature provides policy recommendations for planning and development in the post-pandemic era, however fewer studies focus on the short-term recovery trends and diverse responses to the pandemic (that were) made by airports. This paper introduces four impact dimensions faced by airports as a result of the pandemic: airport operations, geographical location, socio-economic environment, and government pandemic policies. Panel and group regression were employed to explore the factors associated with airports’ response to the pandemic in relation to the four dimensions. The seat capacity at the airports was forecast for a non-pandemic scenario using ARIMA models. The residual ratios between the predicted and the actual seat capacity values were the dependent variables capturing the pandemic effect. The results show that, in addition to the direct effect of the pandemic policy, the location of the airport (and other transport modes in its vicinity) had a significant impact on its short-term recovery. Further, the extent of the impact varied by region. The findings of the correlation between different factors and airport responses provide policymakers with more targeted recovery strategies. At the macro-scale, the analysis of multidimensional factors suggests recommendations for airlines and planners for a faster and more efficient recovery of the aviation networks for future disruptions.",0965-8564,Not found
Determining the role of self-efficacy in sustained behavior change: An empirical study on intention to use community-based electric ride-sharing,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103921,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"This study aims to explore the role of travel-related self-efficacy in sustained behavior change. Community-based electric ride-sharing as a pilot project has been introduced to reduce residents’ reliance on private cars in Bangkok, Thailand. This study integrated the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and goal-framing theory to explain the cognitive process from intending a trial ride to sustaining behavioral change to substitute present travel modes. A sample of 101 valid responses was collected from the service users. The findings show a pivotal role of travel-related self-efficacy in encouraging users to keep using the promoted service by finding eudaimonic and normative goals during the intervention. Multi-group analysis was further applied to examine the moderating roles of transport mode preferences on hypothesized relationships. Pilot service users showed overall high self-efficacy associated with community-based mobility, and the stated self-efficacy was positively related to the intention to sustain behavior change. However, a drastic decrease was shown in user intention to pay for the service. Additional evidence was given to inform the importance of an affordable mobility service to secure residents’ self-efficacy in daily transport.

High-speed railway ripples on the greenness: Insight from urban green vegetation cover,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103915,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Less attention has been paid to the potential ecological pressures brought about by high-speed rail (HSR) while promoting urban prosperity. Based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and multiple socio-economic and ecological data, this study examines the local effect and spatial spillover effect of HSR operation on green vegetation coverage (GVC) in Chinese cities from 2003 to 2014, using a difference-in-differences design and spatial econometrics. Main findings are: 1) HSR operation has reduced GVC of local cities by about 6.0%. Because HSR-triggered economic agglomeration has intensified the land development and increased the pollution emissions (represented by SO2 and dust), leading to the degradation of local green vegetation. 2) The local effects of HSR on urban GVC are heterogeneous. HSR operation seriously cuts down the GVC for development-saturated cities, slightly undercuts the GVC for cities with conventional railways, but positively boosts the GVC for ecotourism cities. 3) HSR operation increases the GVC of adjacent cities (cities contiguous to HSR-located cities) by about 3.8%. Because the economic siphoning effect of HSR on adjacent cities reduces their land needs and pollution emissions, thus providing conditions for the vegetation expansion. Note that the HSR’s impact on adjacent cities’ GVC is influenced by the economic disparity between HSR cities and their neighbors.

Multi-criteria assessment and ranking framework for the potential of cargo cycle operation: Using New York city as an example,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103898,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Making deliveries in crowded urban areas can be challenging for commercial vehicles, producing additional negative externalities.

In addition, previous studies often ignore the possible nonlinear association between them. Applying Gradient Boosting Decision Trees to the data in the Twin Cities, USA, this study explores the nonlinear relationships between built environment attributes and driving distance in suburban areas and illustrates how the relationships differ from those in urban areas. The results show that suburban residents are less sensitive to the built environment than urban residents. More importantly, built environment policies that work in urban areas might be infertile in suburban areas. Although many studies have advocated population densification and mixed-use development for driving mitigation, this study suggests that these policies are ineffective in suburban areas. Instead, promoting job accessibility and densifying intersection density are promising to reduce auto use in suburban areas.

It is also important to evaluate the effects of the policies to document and update them with time. The purpose of this study is to examine road traffic crashes with fatalities and severe injuries at the county level in Sweden, considering both planned innovative policies and the unexpected influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on road traffic crashes with fatalities and severe injuries from 2010 to 2021 in twenty-one counties in Sweden were collected, as well as road network data, vehicle registration data, land use data and socio-demographic data. Negative binomial autoregressive models with region fixed effect were proposed to estimate the effects of explanatory variables on crash frequency, along with Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) models. The findings demonstrate that the speed limit changes and the introduction of safety cameras in Sweden is effective in reducing fatalities and severe injuries. Importantly, different regions exhibit distinct responses to these interventions, with varying effects on different types of crashes. Additionally, findings show that other factors, such as land use characteristics, presence of trucks, and population density also influence the crash frequencies. Moreover, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic was investigated, which shows a reduction in traffic crashes during the pandemic period.

Comparative Analysis of Usage Patterns and Underlying Determinants for Ride-hailing and Traditional Taxi Services: A Chicago Case Study,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103912,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"As app-based ride-hailing (or e-hailing) services have achieved great success worldwide, the traditional taxi industry faces an unprecedented crisis. To gain a deeper understanding of these two distinct modes that both offer door-to-door mobility services, in this study, we use Chicago as a case to comparatively analyze the travel patterns of the app-based ride-hailing and traditional taxi services and understand how socio-demographic and urban land use attributes affect the usage of two services in temporal and spatial dimensions. We employ the local regression models named geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) models that can capture the spatiotemporal nonstationarity between variables as the primary analysis tool. Four GTWR models that predict the average hourly taxi or ride-hailing trip volume on weekdays or weekends for each community area are carefully constructed with R^2 all above 0.98. The nonstationarity test shows all variables exhibit extra local variations, indicating the necessity of using the GTWR models to explore the attributes’ spatiotemporal impacts. Spatial error models (SEM) and ordinary least square (OLS) models, global regression models, are also built as comparisons and benchmark references. The differences between global and local regression models are illustrated through clustering analysis. To compare and contrast the usage patterns of ride-hailing and taxi services, we analyze the temporal-spatially varying coefficients of GTWR models. Interpretations are provided for our interesting findings, including the strong trip generation power of the population in the South Side area, the attitude of white people towards taxi services is positive but ambiguous towards ride-hailing services, young people's opposing behaviors towards taxi services on weekdays and weekends, and the opposite relationship between transit and taxi or ride-hailing in certain areas.

In particular, the international shipping involves different countries and stakeholders, making it difficult to form a unified antitrust immunity and maritime policy. This study builds a tripartite dynamic evolutionary game model composed of stakeholders including the shipping alliances, ports, and governments. It analyses the complex impacts of government policy, cooperation between the port and shipping alliance, accountability mechanism, and sudden changes in the external environment on the different stakeholders’ decisions. The stability points, evolution process, and evolution speed of the tripartite game, along with the movement of the convergence point in the unstable state, are investigated. Furthermore, the mutual influence of the three parties, especially that of government policy on the evolution process regarding the pricing strategy and antitrust immunity, is discussed. The results show that the reduction in the freight rate difference makes it easier for the alliance to choose a low-freight strategy under the antitrust immunity policy. The government could cooperate with the port and indirectly restrict the alliance through the port extra charge, while an increase in the alliance supply would weaken the port’s bargaining power. This research also investigates the timing of government regulation by considering the sudden fluctuations of the market and the international political risk when the three parties exert a push–pull pressure on one another’s decisions and provides comprehensive decision support for the three parties from the perspective of dynamic evolution.",0965-8564,Not found

The evolution of telework arrangements between the pre-and after-pandemic periods is explored through a joint model system estimated using a joint multivariate methodology. Results show that, After COVID, the population of workers is generally inclined toward a hybrid work arrangement, with an overall tendency to engage in a higher frequency of teleworking than Before COVID. Finally, teleworkers have a higher propensity to work only from home as opposed to working only from a third workplace or from a combination of home and a third workplace. Overall, our results indicate that telework arrangements may remain at an elevated level into the future, with home serving as the dominant telework location. These findings suggest that transportation demand forecasting models need to be updated to reflect higher levels of teleworking, as well as the heterogeneity across individuals in teleworking adoption, frequency, and location.",0965-8564,Not found
Traffic safety versus accessibility: Investigating resistance against speed limit reductions,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103920,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"For traffic safety reasons, Sweden has lowered speed limits on major roads that lack directional separation of traffic. For some of these roads, regional authorities, municipalities, and other local stakeholders have sent appeals to the government opposing the implemented speed limit reductions. The appeals have mainly referred to negative effects on regional development and have suggested that the speed limit reductions be abandoned. This paper identifies the characteristics of roads where appeals against speed limit reductions have been filed and where local stakeholders claim that speed limit reductions are a threat to accessibility and regional development. The results of logistic regression modelling show that appeals are more likely for speed limit reductions on long road sections, on European roads, and in areas with a state university, and less likely in areas with high population density and areas defined as vulnerable by the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth. We investigated these policy conflicts using frame theory. In this paper, we identify two policy frames: speed limits for traffic safety and speed limits for regional development. These two policy frames are related to different views on how to best strive towards regional accessibility and safety goals in remote areas. The different views are likely not easily aligned by more information or facts since they concern deeper questions, such as what constitutes basic accessibility of good quality and how large risks are acceptable on the road network. This study thus uncovers not only a policy disagreement but a policy controversy in the Swedish context.",0965-8564,Not found
Smartphone mobility assistants. A lever to guide route choice preferences in mass transit?,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103914,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The regulation of passenger congestion in mass transit is a persistent issue that requires ingenious and cost-effective solutions to ensure that related operations run at optimum capacity. Mass transit operators may implement Public Transport Demand Management (PTDM) strategies like cognitive levers to tackle this issue by targeting passengers’ behaviour during the route planning that precedes travel in mass transit. In this regard, multiple experimental studies in cognitive psychology and sciences have shown that transit maps can be used to guide passengers’ route choice preferences in mass transit. A route choice experiment was conducted to examine the potential of smartphone mobility assistants as a tool to guide mass transit users’ away from the fastest options that tend to be predominantly preferred. 582 participants took part in an online study where they engaged in a route selection task by indicating their route choices in the Île-de-France mass transit system. We measured how participants’ preferences for the fastest route varied depending on the visual format in which routes were presented (on a transit map, on a timeline or listed briefly as per current trends), the presence of conflicting visuo-spatial information on the transit map (fastest choice = shortest vs. longest choice) and the level of comfort (availability of simple transfers and/or less congested routes). The main results suggest the existence of two levers than can be implemented in smartphone mobility assistants to manage passenger congestion in mass transit: (1) a perceptive heuristic whereby passengers presented with a transit map manifest a preference for the route presented as the shortest on the map and (2) the possibility to sway a proportion of passengers away from the choice of the fastest route by presenting information about the comfort levels of alternative options.",0965-8564,Not found
Calibrating walkability indicators for commute walk trips: A structural equation modeling approach,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103896,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Walking plays a significant role in promoting public health, decreasing air pollution, and vitalizing cities. Walkability is an important notion that transportation planners and policymakers often use to quantify the suitability of and to promote travelers’ propensity for walking in an urban area. This paper adopts a data-driven approach using structural equation modeling for simultaneous estimation of 1) a latent construct of walkability using different walkability indicators (thus estimation of weights of the indicators), and 2) the effect of walkability on commute walking behavior for an urban area. Doing so accounts for the effects of various indicators of walkability as well as socio-economic and security characteristics. A Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model is developed to estimate both direct and indirect effects of walkability on the share of commute walk trips in total commute trips for the city of Chicago using census tract-level data. We find that walkability is the most important factor affecting the share of commute walk trips. Among the indicators of walkability, transit- and job density-related indicators are the most important ones. Some socio-economic factors, especially travel time, vehicle ownership, and college student share, also critically influence the propensity for walking to commute. We further find that our calibrated walkability score results in a different hotspot distribution in Chicago than using the uncalibrated walkability score, as is currently practiced by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, but is more consistent with hotspot distribution of the actual commute walk trips in the city. These findings advance the understanding and characterization of walkability and actual walking behavior in urban areas, which in turn helps inform pedestrian infrastructure investment and policy making.",0965-8564,Not found
Is multimodality advantageous? Assessing the relationship between multimodality and perceived transport adequacy and accessibility in different travel contexts,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103893,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Multimodality is regarded as essential to promoting sustainable mobility because of the widely found environmental benefits, although it is unclear whether individuals experience multimodality as a benefit or a burden. This study aims to investigate the relationship between multimodality and perceived transport adequacy and accessibility in different travel contexts. Using data collected in two large Dutch cities, we realized the research aim from three perspectives. First, a multigroup multimodality index was constructed to measure the variability of transport mode use at both major-category and sub-category levels, which somehow addressed the mode classification issue in measuring multimodality. Second, by performing a regression analysis on the factors associated with multimodality, we found that multimodality occurs in different travel contexts related to certain conditions or constraints. Third, the effects of multimodality as well as the interaction effects of car-related factors and multimodality on two factors of perceived transport adequacy and perceived accessibility are assessed using stepwise regression models. Results show that multimodality is burdensome, especially for those who rely on cars. Specifically, being more multimodal is generally associated with higher perceived disadvantage and lower perceived accessibility; for people who experience the ease of driving or have limited access to a car, being more multimodal results in even lower perceived achievement or perceived accessibility. The results indicate that even in compact and less car-dependent urban settings, multimodality lacks attraction and reducing car use is difficult. The findings inform multimodal transport policies and planning to balance social and environmental values by assessing and minimizing the negative individual externalities.",0965-8564,Not found
A framework of routine transitions in daily travel,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103891,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The occurrence of life events increases the likelihood of changes in travel behaviour and these are often discussed as windows of opportunity for interventions aimed at improving sustainable travel. Hence, theoretical knowledge of the process of change due to life events is important for enabling the development of interventions suited to these naturally-occurring situations. In this paper, the Framework of RoUtIne Transitions in daily travel (FRUIT) is presented, depicting the internal processes involved when one chapter of life, characterized by stability in daily travel, gives way to another. Building on theory relating to habit disruption and formation, and designed for the inclusion of existing models and concepts relating to deliberate decision-making, the framework points to two critical phases as focus areas.

Modeling the resilience of interdependent networks: The role of function dependency in metro and bus systems,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103907,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Owing to the pervasive interdependency among networks and the great threat of various disasters, one of the most challenging issues is the resilience evaluation of interdependent networks. Existing studies have been conducted to analyze interdependent network resilience addressing unidirectional dependency, which triggers and propagates network failures. The loss and recovery of network functionality are complicated and important under such interdependency. Ignoring the interdependency nature of different networks would lead to incomplete or incorrect results in their resilience assessment. This paper developed a resilience assessment model for interdependent transit networks under failures. Taking the interdependency relations, network topology, flow characteristics, and demand distribution into account, the proposed methodology explicitly quantifies the impacts of varying network interdependency on the resilience of interdependent networks. The approach was applied to the interdependent metro and bus networks of Xi’an, China. Results show the resilience of interdependent networks is greatly affected by node degree heterogeneity in topology. The higher the heterogeneity of interdependent nodes, the larger the network resilience becomes. The bidirectional function dependency among networks demonstrates dominant effects on the resilience of interdependent networks if one network is disrupted. If interdependent networks have homogeneous function, the resilience of the networks would be significantly improved with the increase in interdependency. The degree of flow matching between both networks plays a particularly important role in network resilience enhancement. Findings of this study would provide practical implications for the design and planning of interdependent infrastructure systems under disasters.",0965-8564,Not found
A data-driven approach for quantifying the resilience of railway networks,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103913,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Disruptions occur frequently in railway networks, requiring timetable adjustments, while causing serious delays and cancellations. However, little is known about the performance dynamics during disruptions nor the extent to which the resilience curve applies in practice. This paper presents a data-driven quantification approach for an ex-post assessment of the resilience of railway networks. Using historical traffic realization data in the Netherlands, resilience curves are reconstructed using a new composite indicator, and quantified for a large set of single disruptions. The values of the resilience metrics are compared across disruptions of different causes using Welch’s ANOVA and the Games-Howell test. Additionally, representative resilience curves for each disruption cause are determined. Results show a significant heterogeneity in the shape of the resilience curves, even within disruptions of the same cause. The proposed approach represents a useful decision support tool for practitioners to assess disruptions dynamics and propose best measures to improve resilience.",0965-8564,Not found
Service design and frequency setting for the European high-speed rail network,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103906,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"High-speed rail (HSR) is frequently seen as a promising alternative for long-distance travel by air and road, given its environmental advantages whilst offering a competitive level of service. However, a European HSR-network is yet to be realised, with the current state amounting to a patchwork of poorly connected subnetworks. Consequently, this results in a suboptimal performance from a user, operator and societal perspective. We present a customised version of the Transit Network Design and Frequency Setting Problem (TNDFSP) for the long-distance transport context and HSR in particular. We apply an adapted version of a heuristic solution approach to analyse the users’, operators’ and societal performance of a European HSR-network by conducting an extensive series of experiments to test the network’s performance under various policy priorities and HSR design variables. Our experiment results show that designs resulting from the consideration of externalities yield more extensive networks with larger coverage and modal shifts. For such networks to materialise, high public investments are needed. The obtained network designs contain four different line types, exhibit spatial disparities in network density, and allow for the identification of potential hubs and critical infrastructure. The strong network integration with overlapping and border-crossing lines of substantial lengths highlights the importance of cross-border cooperation and rail interoperability. We hope our findings will contribute to the ongoing public and professional debates on designing an attractive and competitive European HSR-network.",0965-8564,Not found
"Cost sharing in passenger transport models: specification, implementation, and impacts",10.1016/j.tra.2023.103897,179,2024-01-01,2024,1,"A common practice in many transport models is to allocate all costs to the car driver meaning that car passengers are essentially free riders. This specification provides an easy way of integrating drivers and passengers and fits well with the general understanding that car drivers rarely trade passenger seats for money. However, in this paper, we question this premise and argue that cost sharing can, and most likely will, take place in a variety of forms different from simple out-off-pocket money exchange. We also stress that from a modelling perspective, this issue is far from irrelevant as it influences not only demand elasticities but also the modelling of car occupancy rates which is one of the key variables when considering congestion, climate impacts, and network utilisation. In the paper we discuss the mechanisms by which costs are shared, consider how this can be operationalised in transport models, and finally, consider the consequences of cost sharing from a transport policy perspective. Based on empirical evidence from Denmark, we find that for trip purposes with high occupancy rates, cost elasticities and occupancy rates tend to be biased if cost sharing is not properly accounted for.",0965-8564,Not found

This study addresses these research gaps by developing non-spatial and spatial autoregressive multiple linear regression and count models for daily and weekly Freight Trip Production (FTP) and Freight Trip Attraction (FTA). We model Freight Shipments (FS) as FTP and Freight Deliveries (FD) as FTA. The results show that the best model for daily and weekly FTP is the spatial Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) model. The best daily and weekly FTA model is the non-spatial Negative Binomial (NB) model. The findings indicate the presence of spatial dependence in the best FTP model, while it is absent in the best FTA model. The elasticity analysis shows that daily models may lead to bias and inaccurate prediction of policy impacts. The study recommends using count models that capture more FTG characteristics with a week as the measurement period and consider spatial dependence, if present.",0965-8564,Not found
Addressing COVID-induced changes in spatiotemporal travel mobility and community structure utilizing trip data: An innovative graph-based deep learning approach,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103973,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions in mobility patterns, leading to changes in user travel behavior. Understanding users’ travel demand, travel behaviors, and changes in the structure of the travel network becomes the basis for governments and operators to provide improved service quality. Public transportation in a city provides essential mobility, accessibility, and connectivity for residents. The burgeoning shared mobility sector utilizes the Internet to establish a management platform that leverages digital technology to offer convenient travel services. Bike sharing presents a new transport mode for short-distance trips strengthening connectivity with public travel modes such as buses and subways, while online taxi services take on long-distance trips within cities. This paper proposes a network-based deep learning method to address the COVID-induced changes in spatiotemporal travel mobility and community structure detection, which integrates graph learning and optimization in an end-to-end training approach. The approach involves constructing a dynamic travel network and adopting complex network theory to develop metrics that uncover the changes in user mobility patterns and explore the correlation between different travel modes. Our results show that the pandemic reduces overall trip volume and network structure changes, suggesting that productive and residential activities have partially recovered but remain far from pre-pandemic levels, especially for taxi and subway trips. These findings provide valuable insights for transportation planners and policymakers to explore strategies that promote more sustainable and resilient mobility patterns in the post-pandemic era.",0965-8564,Not found
Using mobile phone big data and street view images to explore the mismatch between walkability and walking behavior,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103946,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Stimulating more citizens to walk plays an essential role in building a healthy city. This paper explores the mismatch between walkability and walking behavior, using mobile phone data, street view images, and various sources of open data. Using Shenzhen as our case study, we identified walking trips of 6 months in 2021 from cellular mobile data, taking the rule-based heuristics approach. We collected ground truth GPS data to validate the walking trip extraction method. Open data and deep learning enabled quantifying walkability from the perspective of four pedestrian needs: safety, convenience, continuity, and attractiveness. We employed geospatial techniques to identify the mismatch areas between walkability and walking behavior in the city. We also explored the spatially varying effects of walkability on walking behavior. Our results showed that the mismatch areas with high-level walking trips but low-level walkability mainly occurred in the fringe areas of the central business district (CBD) and subcenters that require prioritizing more interventions. Moreover, walkability showed strong effects on walking trips in the inner suburbs. For the four aspects of our walkability framework, safety and convenience had greater positive effects on walking trips in suburbs than in urban areas. Continuity promotes walking trips mainly in the city’s western sector. The positive effect of attractiveness on walking trips clustered in the central and western parts of the city.

Regulating transportation network companies with a mixture of autonomous vehicles and for-hire human drivers,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103975,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"This paper investigates the equity impacts of autonomous vehicles (AV) on for-hire human drivers and passengers in a ride-hailing market, and examines regulation policies that protect human drivers and improve transport equity for ride-hailing passengers. We consider a transportation network companies (TNC) that employs a mixture of AVs and human drivers to provide ride-hailing services. The TNC platform determines the spatial prices, fleet size, human driver payments, and vehicle relocation strategies to maximize its profit, while individual passengers choose between different transport modes to minimize their travel costs. A market equilibrium model is proposed to capture the interactions among passengers, human drivers, AVs, and TNC over the transportation network. The overall problem is formulated as a non-concave program, and an algorithm is developed to derive its approximate solution with a theoretical performance guarantee. Our study shows that TNC prioritizes AV deployment in higher-demand areas to make a higher profit. As AVs flood into these higher-demand areas, they compete with human drivers in the urban core and push them to relocate to suburbs. This leads to reduced earning opportunities for human drivers and increased spatial inequity for passengers. To mitigate these concerns, we consider: (a) a minimum wage for human drivers; and (b) a restrictive pickup policy that prohibits AVs from picking up passengers in higher-demand areas. In the former case, we show that a minimum wage for human drivers will protect them from the negative impact of AVs with negligible impacts on passengers. However, there exists a threshold beyond which the minimum wage will trigger the platform to replace the majority of human drivers with AVs. In the latter case, we show that prohibiting AVs from picking up passengers in higher-demand areas not only improves the spatial equity of ride-hailing services for passengers, but also substantially increases human driver surplus and restricts the increase of total fleet size compared to the unregulated case. These results are validated with realistic case studies for San Francisco.",0965-8564,Not found
Does telecommuting reduce trip-making? Evidence from a U.S. panel during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103972,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Telecommuting has risen to unprecedented levels in the past three years and remains one of the most disrupted aspects of transportation behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we investigate the transport impacts of telecommuting. We use a combination of passively collected Point of Interest (POI) data between January 2020 and December 2021 and five waves of actively collected surveys on a panel of participants to quantify the effects of changes in the frequency of telecommuting on the total number of daily and weekly trips that a telecommuter makes, as well as their total daily and weekly distance traveled. We overcome important limitations of related work in the literature by controlling for unobserved confounders using fixed-effect and first-difference regressions. Doing so, we find evidence that telecommuting results in the generation of new non-commute trips that offset a significant portion of the reduction in commute trips. We show that telecommuters make an average of roughly one additional non-commute trip on telecommute days relative to commute days. The additional trip is on average shorter than the commute trip, as we find that the total distance traveled on telecommute days is significantly shorter than on commute days for employees in our panel. At the weekly level, we also find that one additional day of telecommuting results in one additional non-commute trip. This suggests that the additional non-commute trip on telecommuting days is a newly generated trip, rather than a trip substituted from other days of the week. The weekly analysis also confirms that the non-commute trip is on average shorter than the two-way commute trips, as the total weekly distance traveled by workers in our sample decreases by about 15 km for every day of telecommuting. Our results suggest that the trip reduction effects of telecommuting could be overestimated if telecommuting-induced new trip generation is not properly accounted for.",0965-8564,Not found
Do teleworking and online shopping influence modality styles for work and shopping tours?

While a large body of research investigates the relationship between ICT use and various travel outcomes, the consideration of mode use has been limited, with most studies only focusing on a subset of modes and overlooking differences across travel purposes. Therefore, there remains a shortage of literature taking a comprehensive view of the multiple dimensions of mode use in the context of ICT use and capturing all principal modes that travelers may use. We investigate the relationship between an individual’s ICT use and their habitual mode use, termed modality style, which is considered an indicator of latent preferences for certain transportation modes. Using a one-week travel-activity diary from the 2019 Puget Sound Regional Household Travel dataset, latent class cluster analyses of work, grocery shopping, and non-grocery shopping tours are performed to distinguish modality styles for the respective travel purposes. The analysis finds a relationship between ICT use and modality style, and a distinct class of Non-travelers is found in the case of work and non-grocery shopping travel, consisting of individuals with high levels of teleworking and online shopping. A key outcome is the identification of modality styles that are characterized by moderate car use, frequent carpooling, and high levels of ICT use. Furthermore, the respective work travel modality style has lower household car ownership than the more car-centric modality style. Thus, this study not only contributes to unraveling the relationship between ICT use and mode use but also the relationship between ICT use and car ownership.",0965-8564,Not found
"Cost-benefit assessments of an e-bike subvention programme in Oslo, Norway",10.1016/j.tra.2024.103974,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"In an attempt to increase the bicycle share in transport in Oslo, the municipality launched an e-bike subvention programme in 2016. One thousand persons were to receive a 20% subvention if they bought an e-bike, by registering via a municipal webpage on a first come first served basis. Nearly 700 ended up buying a subsidised e-bike. A connected research project surveyed subvention recipients and non-recipients, including registration of daily transport by cycle/e-bike, walk, car, and public transport, before the programme took effect, with a similar surveying after most of those qualifying for subvention had bought their e-bike. In this paper we assess the effects of the e-bike subvention in a cost-benefit analysis. The cost-benefit analysis compares the cost of carrying out the e-bike subvention programme against the benefits due to transport mode shift and increased active travel. The benefits, the changes in monetised external effects, comprise two main elements: the health effect from active travel and the congestion, emissions, etc. caused by cars and larger vehicles. Differently from former studies, we take into account that transport mode changes following from a bicycle project will normally not imply only shift from private car to bicycling, but also shifts from walking and public transport to cycling. Moreover, some of the negative external effects from private cars and public transport vehicles are already internalised via taxation and can be deducted from the calculations. Our ex-post assessment of the implemented e-bike programme indicates that the benefits in the year of implementation probably surpassed the costs of the programme. The benefit calculation was relatively robust to alternative assumptions for the road transport (the share of electric cars, the occupancy in public transport, and the share of congested travel), but relatively less robust to altered assumption about the active travel. However, if there is an impact of the e-bike subvention programme beyond the implementation year, we have underestimated the benefits.",0965-8564,Not found
Evaluating travel behavior resilience across urban and Rural areas during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Contributions of vaccination and epidemiological indicators,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103980,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted travel behavior across diverse socio-economic areas, with a significant impact on transportation systems, public health, and the economy.

Using an integrated dataset with over 150 million US county-level mobile device data from 01/01/2020 to 20/04/2021, we employ Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models to infer the relative impact of the vaccination intervention on five types of travel behavior across Metropolitan, Micropolitan and Rural areas. Further, we develop partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to accurately estimate how COVID-19 vaccination rates, epidemiological indicators (i.e., COVID-19 incidence rates, death rates, and testing rates) and weather conditions (i.e., temperature, rain, and snow) would impact various travel behaviors across the diverse areas during the recovery period of the pandemic. The model results shed light on the positive role of vaccinations in fostering the recovery of travel behaviors and reveal the disparities in travel behavior resilience in response to vaccination rates, epidemiological indicators, and weather conditions across diverse areas.

On the air-HSR mode substitution in China: From the carbon intensity reduction perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103977,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"This study explores how the introduction of high-speed rail (HSR) in China has contributed to a reduction in aviation carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) emissions. In line with China's Dual Carbon Policy, the nation has set ambitious goals to achieve carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, necessitating comprehensive industrial upgrades across all sectors. Despite the challenges associated with decarbonizing the aviation industry, we conduct empirical analysis to examine the competitive impact of China's domestic high-speed rail network on air transportation and emphasize the environmental benefits of HSR in reducing aviation carbon emissions. Firstly, we construct a panel dataset covering China's domestic air routes and high-speed rail spanning from 2009 to 2019. Our staggered difference-in-differences analysis reveals that the introduction of HSR had a negative impact on China's medium-haul aviation market. Specifically, our analysis estimates that the entry of HSR into the medium-short-haul (600–1000 km) and medium-long-haul (1000–1400 km) air markets resulted in the removal of over 367.8 thousand and 713.3 thousand seats per city pair, respectively. Considering China's power generation mix and carbon emission factors, we calculate that within these two distance ranges, the negative impact of HSR on aviation has resulted in significant environmental benefits. From 2010 to 2019, each city pair with an HSR connection has achieved cumulative savings, averaging 69.57 thousand and 200.69 thousand tons of aviation carbon emissions, respectively. Furthermore, with the optimization of power generation mix and the implementation of dual carbon policy, HSR will continuously contribute to saving 6,436 tons of carbon emissions per city pair by 2035. Prior to the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel, high-speed rail may have played a significant role in reducing aviation carbon emissions. In conclusion, our findings confirm that if China maintains its commitment to decarbonize the power generation industry, HSR holds great potential to further reduce aviation carbon dioxide emissions.",0965-8564,Not found
The proposed model for analyzing off-street parking Dynamics: A case study of Taipei City,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103965,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"To reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and lost revenue due to wasted driving around looking for parking spaces, effective parking management has become a crucial issue in urban areas. Previous studies have shown that parking demand is related to the location of parking spaces/lots, parking fees, time spent looking for spaces, and various driver and environmental characteristics. However, there have been more studies of on-street rather than off-street parking. Also, the spatio-temporal variance between variables and turnover rate (such as the hours of operation for various types of Points of Interest (POIs) as well as the causes of bias estimators has been largely overlooked. To solve the above problems, the Geographical and Temporal Weighted Regression (GTWR) model was utilized in this study to predict the hourly parking turnover rate in off-street parking lots. The flexible coefficient setting of this model can be used to capture the spatial and temporal variance. In addition to this model, the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models were used as a basis for comparison. The study included 346 public off-street parking lots in Taipei and 10 types of nearby POIs. The study period was for 24 h on August 31, 2021. Due to the dissimilar trend of the turnover rate, the researchers separated all parking lots into three groups for regression analysis: those that experience a daytime decrease, remain stable, and those with an increase during the day. Our results show the following: (1) For the types of parking lots that experienced increases and decreases, the GTWR model performed best for the prediction of hourly turnover rate, while all models performed similarly for the prediction of the stable type parking lot. (2) With regard to related factors (the type 1 parking lot for example), parking lots in areas with more traditional markets, MRT stations, and with fewer schools, supermarkets, hotel bus stops, and lower parking fees tended to have higher turnover rates. (3) Incorporating a more precise POI dataset (the number and types of POIs as well as their business hours) and applying a suitable spatial temporal model improved the parking demand model’s performance. However, the GTWR model’s limitations may hamper its performance, especially with regard to analysis of the time-stable parking lots or variables. Future studies might include other datasets, such as nearby private parking lots or holiday data to improve the model fit.",0965-8564,Not found

We estimate models of scrappage rates and survival probabilities as a function of vehicle age for U.S. passenger cars, SUVs and vans, and pickup trucks, using population counts of vehicles in operation by vehicle type and model year for calendar years 2002–2020. Our results indicate that life expectancies for all three vehicle types continued to increase over this recent time period, by 2–3 years for passenger cars, 3–4 years for SUVs and Vans, and 5–6 years for pickup trucks. By 2020, median expected lifetimes ranged from about 17 years for passenger cars to 20 years for SUVs and vans, and 25 years for pickup trucks. The content and durability of new vehicles is likely to continue to increase as the market transitions to more electrified and automated vehicles, with important implications for policies aimed at reducing emissions, increasing fuel economy and improving safety.",0965-8564,Not found
A sampling scheme for quantifying and benchmarking on time performance of urban bus transit,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103945,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"In this paper we use large-scale mass transit data to improve the journey time performance measurement of urban bus systems. For low frequency bus services, the application of on-time performance (OTP) metrics, particularly the location and number of stops to sample, varies greatly across operators, which can lead to biased estimates. In this paper, we aim to address sampling disparity, and propose a new statistically robust sampling scheme to ensure representative, non-biased, and comparable measurement of route level on time performance (OTP) which enables the inclusion of operators with sparse data in benchmarking activities. We use automated vehicle location data and analyse 59 unique low frequency route-direction data sets from 9 international bus operators. Across all route-direction data sets, an average of 28% of stops are required to be sampled under the defined sampling scheme to achieve a 95% confidence level of sampling the route-level mean within a ± 5% range of accuracy. By including data on additional routes, the analysis can be further refined and generalised to enable progressive improvement of inter-operator comparability and benchmarking.",0965-8564,Not found
Examining user satisfaction and vehicle development for Mini EVs and Non-mini EVs,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103952,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Mini electric vehicles (EVs) have gained popularity due to their subcompact size and affordable price. However, no studies focus on their user satisfaction and how it differs from Non-mini EVs. This study fills this gap to examine the determinants of user satisfaction and vehicle development based on a sample of 707 EV adopters. The results of the proposed structural equation models suggest that performance satisfaction significantly influences overall satisfaction. Results also highlight the distinct factors that contribute to overall satisfaction between Mini and Non-mini EVs. For Mini EVs, ease of driving plays a crucial role in overall satisfaction, whereas charging satisfaction is key for Non-mini EVs. Additionally, the development of Mini EVs is driven by lifestyle change and cost satisfaction, while the development of Non-Mini EVs is also influenced by repurchase intention. Furthermore, the status symbol impacts lifestyle for Non-mini EV users, but this is not the case for Mini EV users. These findings provide valuable insights for EV technology development, marketing strategies, and policy-making.",0965-8564,Not found
An efficient pavement distress detection scheme through drone–ground vehicle coordination,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103949,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Efficient road maintenance is imperative for infrastructure longevity and safety. Conventional ground vehicle-based methods for detecting pavement distress, however, encounter limitations in practice when dealing with complex road structures. Drones, endowed with greater spatial freedom, can access road segments that are hard-to-reach to ground vehicles, thereby enhancing detection efficiency and expanding detection coverage. By harnessing the complementary strengths of both detection modalities, we propose a scheme that capitalizes on the cooperative coordination of drones and ground vehicles for effective pavement distress detection. Our proposed scheme is evaluated using realistic road networks in practice. Results reveal that the coordinated detection scheme strikes a favorable balance between fixed device-related expenses and detection efficiency. This scheme offers promising policy implications, streamlining maintenance across diverse road networks and meeting extensive infrastructure needs, offering policymakers an efficient and viable scheme for road infrastructure maintenance.",0965-8564,Not found
"Framing active school travel in Ontario, or how spinach is good for you",10.1016/j.tra.2024.103953,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Active school travel (AST) is promoted in many jurisdictions, including Ontario, Canada, where there is provincial support for school travel planning (STP) efforts. Two pillars of school travel plans in the province are education and encouragement. For these pillars to stand, relevant stakeholders must be cognizant of and understand the issues and stakes. For this reason, we deem it important to understand how AST is communicated. In this research we adopt framing analysis to investigate the ways in which various organizations communicate to the public around AST. A frame is a central organizing idea or story line that provides meaning to a particular phenomenon, and thus helps to set the parameters for conversations about policy. In the case of AST, framing can influence what policy alternatives are perceived as available by children, parents, and their wider communities. The research is supported by natural language processing techniques applied to publicly available documents from Ontario stakeholders involved in school travel planning. We then compare the findings from these documents to a selection of academic studies on AST. We conclude that framing of AST in Ontario is mostly empirical-scientific in style, and largely in agreement with academic research on AST. However, it is essentially conservative and does not challenge the status quo of motorized travel. Furthermore, the frames tend to download responsibility for change to households, which limits the scope of policy alternatives by keeping collective action out of the frame.",0965-8564,Not found
Understanding user equilibrium states of road networks: Evidence from two Chinese mega-cities using taxi trajectory mining,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103976,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"User equilibrium (UE) has long been regarded as the cornerstone of transport planning studies. Despite its fundamental importance, our understanding of the actual UE state of road networks has remained surprisingly incomplete. Using big datasets of taxi trajectories, this study investigates the UE states of road networks in two Chinese mega-cities, i.e., Wuhan and Shenzhen. Effective indicators, namely relative gaps, are introduced to quantify how actual traffic states deviate from theoretical UE states. Advanced machine learning techniques, including XGBoost and SHAP values, are employed to analyze nonlinear relationships between network disequilibrium states and seven influencing factors extracted from trajectory data. The results in these two study areas reveal consistent and significant gaps between actual traffic states and the theoretical UE states at various times of the day during both weekdays and weekends. The XGBoost analysis shows that differences in travel distances, travel speeds, and signalized intersection numbers among alternative routes are the primary causes of road network disequilibrium. The results of this study could present several important methodological and policy implications for using the UE models in transport applications.",0965-8564,Not found
Adopting electric bus for improving efficiency in the local public transport sector: Analysis of facilitating conditions and their nonlinear relationships,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103967,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) are technological innovations that have the potential to strengthen efficiency and sustainability improvement within the transportation sector. However, privately owned local bus transport firms lack the resources to make ZEVs especially Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) easily accessible for their logistics services. Therefore, this study proposes to pave the way for technological transformation in the public transport (PT) sector by exploring how these local bus businesses can facilitate the sustained use of BEVs in order to establish a better efficiency from their services. Specifically, the critical facilitating conditions for adopting batter-electric buses (BEBs) in privately owned local PT companies were obtained using Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Fuzzy DEMATEL) while their nonlinear relationships of importance levels were predicted using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). A system dynamics model was proposed that illustrates the dynamic nonlinear relationships of the multiple effects of these conditions on transport efficiency (TE). Based on empirical evidence in Nigeria, the proposed methods were verified and the study results predict that government support, affordable electricity tariffs, access to electric minibuses and presence of charging infrastructure are foremost in boosting the sustained use of BEBs in the local PT sector. Meanwhile, government support improves TE more quickly in a short period while presence of charging infrastructure, affordable electricity tariffs and access to electric minibuses are more effective for stimulating TE over a longer period. This study has implications for decision makers and policy makers that design strategies for BEB adoption to improve TE in the local public transport sector.",0965-8564,Not found
Does new airport investment promote urban economic development?: Global evidence from nighttime light data,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103948,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"This study aims to provide global evidence on the net impact of new airport investment on urban economic development by analyzing cities with/without new airport construction in a quasi-experimental design framework. A two-way fixed difference-in-differences (DID) method along with Mahalanobis distance matching (MDM) is applied to scrutinize the causal association of new airport investment with urban economic development. This empirical analysis assumes nighttime light intensity at a grid-cell scale of 15 arc-second as an economic indicator. We regress nighttime light intensity from 2015 to 2019 for 27 treatment cities with new airport construction from 2015 to 2017 and other control cities selected from 13,038 cities in the world. The estimation results indicate that new airport construction increases nighttime light intensity by (1) about 10.8 % in cities that had demonstrated relatively low nighttime light intensity and (2) about 9.5 % in cities that had introduced their first airports.

Behavioural modelling of metro car choice,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103970,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Overcrowding in metro systems can exert a negative impact on the travel experience of the passengers and on the system’s capacity. This can affect passengers in different ways, worsening their perception of safety, altering their behaviour, decreasing their satisfaction, and leading to higher travel-time sensitivities. One of the causes of overcrowding can be attributed to some metro cars being selected more often than others, and thus, the distribution of passengers inside the train not being homogeneous. This study adopts a disaggregated approach based on the observed behaviour to understand why some specific metro cars are preferred. The characteristics of passengers and metro cars that generate heterogeneity in the load profiles are identified and the motives behind passenger choices are understood by formulating a hybrid latent-class choice model. The behavioural models consider sociodemographic characteristics, level-of-service information, and attitudinal latent variables. Once a metro car choice model was obtained, an operational micro-simulator of the metro was programmed to evaluate how passengers' choices would be affected by altering variables related to the design of the stations, assessing it based on the current situation. Subsequently, interventions to station layouts are made based on the forecast of the behavioural models, to affect passenger choices and produce more homogeneous passenger distributions in the train. The intervention presented in this study reduced 46.49 h of total travel time during the morning peak hours; the impact was greater when considering individual perceptions. Incentives can be developed for optimising the distribution of passengers in metro cars by understanding passenger choice using a behavioural approach, and therefore, they can improve the passenger experience.",0965-8564,Not found
Urban rail transit network topology evolutionary stage has influence on rail ridership: Insights from linear mixed-effects models with heterogeneity in variances,10.1016/j.tra.2023.103951,180,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Determining the impact of the evolutionary stage (ES) of urban rail transit (URT) network topology on daily ridership (DR) can be beneficial for policymakers when analyzing recent stagnated ridership in some cities. This paper used city-level data from 26 Chinese cities from 2013 to 2019 to investigate this. Eleven variables comprising socioeconomic attributes (population density and the average wage of employees), the availability of other transit modes (the number of taxis, the number of private cars, the bus network length, and the street network length), service-related attributes (the number of trains in operation, the average headway during peak period, the opened days, and rail fare), and a network topological characteristic (the average path length) were introduced as covariates. In addition, city class was introduced as a grouping variable to capture the unobserved characteristics of the investigated cities. Two linear mixed-effects models (M1 and M2) were developed, with an interaction term between city class and ES being introduced in M2. The variances were allowed to vary to account for the heterogeneity of the predictor, which improved the overall fit of the models. The estimation results reveal a significant positive within-subject effect of ES on DR in both models, which varied according to city class. This implies that for each city, improving ES increased DR and the scale of the increase in DR is associated with the city’s class. However, there is no evidence of a relationship between ES and DR across different cities. In addition, the heterogeneity in the variance indicates that underestimating the variances of the effects could lead to inaccurate conclusions. The results of this study can help transit agencies in mastering ridership and assessing the designs of URT network topology.",0965-8564,Not found
A joint analysis of accessibility and household trip frequencies by travel mode,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104007,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This paper examines the endogenous relationship between residential level of accessibility and household trip frequencies to tease out the direct and indirect effects of observed behavioural differences. We estimate a multivariate ordered probit model system, which allows dependence in both observed and unobserved factors, using data from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS), a household travel survey in the Greater Golden Horseshoe Area (GGH) in Toronto. The modelling framework is used to analyse the influence of exogenous variables on eight outcome variables of accessibility levels and trip frequencies by four modes (auto, transit, bicycle and walk), and to explore the nature of the relationships between them. The results confirm our hypothesis that not only does a strong correlation exist between the residential level of accessibility and household trip frequency, but there are also direct effects to be observed. The complementarity effect between auto accessibility and transit trips, and the substitution effect observed between transit accessibility and auto trips highlight the residential neighbourhood dissonance of transit riders. It shows that locations with better transit service are not necessarily locations where people who make more transit trips reside. Essentially, both jointness (due to error correlations) as well as directional effects observed between accessibility and trip frequencies of multiple modes offer strong support for the notion that accessibility and trip frequency by mode constitute a bundled choice and need to be considered as such.",0965-8564,Not found
Stress-testing road networks and access to medical care,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104017,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This research studies how populations depend on road networks for access to health care during crises or natural disasters. So far, most researchers rather studied the accessibility of the whole network or the cost of network disruptions in general, rather than as a function of the accessibility of specific priority destinations like hospitals. Even short delays in accessing healthcare can have significant adverse consequences. We carry out a comprehensive stress test of the entire Austrian road network from this perspective. We simplify the whole network into one consisting of what we call accessibility corridors, deleting single corridors to evaluate the change in accessibility of populations to healthcare. The data created by our stress test was used to generate an importance ranking of the corridors. The findings suggest that certain road segments and corridors are orders of magnitude more important in terms of access to hospitals than the typical one. Our method also highlights vulnerable municipalities and hospitals who may experience demand surges as populations are cut off from their usual nearest hospitals. Even though the skewed importance of some corridors highlights vulnerabilities, they provide policymakers with a clear agenda.",0965-8564,Not found
Real-time dispatch management of shared autonomous vehicles with on-demand and pre-booked requests,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104021,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Autonomous vehicle technology is poised to revolutionize shared vehicle systems, offering the potential for increased efficiency and convenience. To better devise management strategies for shared autonomous vehicles, this paper addresses a real-time dispatch problem with hybrid requests, where on-demand (immediate) and pre-booked (reserved) trip requests coexist. The coexistence of these two types of request behaviors introduces considerable complexity to real-time dispatch due to the uncertainty in trip demand. We design an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach for making vehicle–trip assignments and vehicle relocation decisions. We first formulate the real-time vehicle dispatch problem as a dynamic program and decompose it into time-staged subproblems. To effectively handle the high-dimensional state space, we replace the value functions with tractable approximations and propose a piecewise-linear functional approximation method that captures the spatiotemporal value of vehicles. To calibrate the parameters in the approximations, we propose DualT and DualNext algorithms to provide precise dual information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of our approach. Furthermore, we propose a lookahead strategy that incorporates pre-booked request information into the ADP approach for improving real-time decision-making. We validate the effectiveness of the ADP approach through numerical experiments conducted using taxi data from Brooklyn, New York. The ADP approach outperforms benchmark policies in solution quality while maintaining computational efficiency, and the incorporation of the lookahead strategy significantly enhances the performance of the ADP approach, yielding substantial improvements. Numerical results demonstrate that integrating pre-booked requests into vehicle dispatch management can greatly enhance the system efficiency.",0965-8564,Not found
Do shipping alliances affect freight rates?

Although this helps reduce the oversupply of capacity and cutthroat competition during market downturns, the possible freight rate increase due to potential collusion among member shipping lines is another concern. This study aims to empirically investigate the impacts of SAs on container freight rates on nine major shipping corridors for the period from 2015 to 2020. To measure market concentration, data from a satellite-based Automatic Information System (AIS) is used to identify liner shipping companies' services in each market. We propose to use the alliance-level Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and Concentration Ratio Index (CR) to measure market concentration. Then we used the simulated market concentration measures as the instrumental variable to address the endogeneity issue between freight rates and alliances’ market share. The main finding is that both alliance-level HHI and CR are negatively associated with freight rates, implying that SAs may help reduce prices. This finding provides new insights for antitrust authorities when investigating alliance applications in the liner shipping sector.",0965-8564,Not found
Shifting towards luxury cars: The price and environmental effects of Beijing's vehicle lottery system and an alternative policy,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104012,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This paper investigates changes in the composition of vehicle fleets after Beijing implemented a vehicle lottery system (VLS) in 2011 that randomly allocates a quota of license plates to lottery participants. Using the car registration data, we examine the consumption response at the beginning of the restriction. Our analysis reveals that VLS effectively eliminated over one million additional car registrations in two years, however it also increased purchases of cars that are heavier, have larger engines, and are less fuel-efficient. We highlight that the change was associated with a greater reduction in the retail price of luxury cars compared with economy cars post-VLS implementation. Through a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis, we show that the average retail price in Beijing dropped by an additional 2 percent (about $0.4k) for economy cars and 5.8 percent (around $4.3k) for luxury cars, compared to cities without VLS. This price change increased the attractiveness of luxury cars relatively to economy cars. Furthermore, we build a structural model to estimate the consumer demand on vehicles as well as to simulate and compare other potential policies. Given the drawback of VLS that partially offsets the policy goal of emission elimination, we propose a market-based policy to save fuel consumption while achieving the same target of controlling vehicle growth as VLS.",0965-8564,Not found
Investigating night shift workers’ commuting patterns using passive mobility data,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104002,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Designing public transit services that meet the needs of night shift workers requires understanding their commuting patterns. However, traditional survey methods have faced challenges in contacting and interviewing night shift workers with changing work–sleep schedules. This study aims to investigate night shift workers’ commuting patterns by identifying night shift workers with heterogeneous working patterns in passive mobility data. First, we identify workers and their workplaces from the mobility data using a rule-based method. Subsequently, we cluster individual workers’ workplace-staying records using DBSCAN to find regular working patterns and segment workers with diverse working patterns. We applied the method to the smart card data of Seoul, South Korea, and identified 37,448 night shift workers with six different working patterns. The proportion of night shift workers among presumed workers was 8.9%, which was slightly higher than the 7.2% reported in a national survey. Workers who exclusively worked at nighttime worked near night markets, while three-shift workers’ workplaces mainly appeared near areas with large general hospitals with emergency care centers. The proportion, regular working patterns, and workplace location distribution of the identified night shift workers were generally consistent with the existing survey-based knowledge, suggesting that night shift workers were accurately discovered from the mobility data. The finding suggested that policies to extend transit service time were beneficial for three-shift and 24-hour duty workers. With the proposed method, night shift workers’ regular and essential mobility needs can be identified and provided to cities’ transit authorities to help assess and improve transit services for these workers.",0965-8564,Not found
Global food supply chain resilience assessment: A case in the United Kingdom,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104018,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"With the development of globalisation, countries such as the United Kingdom (UK) heavily rely on shipping for food imports and supplies. With the unpredictable impacts of black swan events, such as the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which are traditional food export countries, global freight supply chains could dramatically change, which significantly affects the global food supply chain (FSC) resilience, requiring new solutions to be found. Therefore, it is vital to assess a country’s food importing system by sea to ensure its FSC resilience. However, it is challenging to analyse different food supply resilience levels on a national scale given the high uncertainties in the key relevant elements (e.g. food supplies and transportation) influencing FSC resilience. This paper aims to develop a new method to assess FSC resilience at a country level by pioneering the combination of the two most relevant attributes, its production-to-supply ratio and shipping transport connectivity, used to present food supply security separately in the current literature. Within this context, food production and import distance affecting the connectivity of various food supplies are selected to estimate FSC resilience in this study. The findings, including a new index framework to assess national food resilience, significantly contribute to a country’s food security and the rational development of countermeasures and policies when necessary. To demonstrate the significance of the findings, the resilience of the UK FSC is first evaluated in a real case study, followed by a comparative study with Canada, Australia, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the FSCs of different countries. The findings of the studies can be used to monitor FSC resilience of the countries and provide rational policies for enhancing FSC resilience.",0965-8564,Not found

To reduce the financial pressure and tap into the profitable cargo business, airlines around the world are actively converting passenger aircraft into cargo planes (i.e., preighters). This paper develops an integrated economic model to examine airlines’ aircraft conversion strategies when facing dynamic market demand due to the pandemic. We consider the possibility of temporary conversion, i.e., passenger aircraft that have been converted into preighters during the pandemic can be converted back into passenger aircraft after the pandemic. We find that when the air cargo transport price is exogenous, the socially optimal conversion rates are lower than the profit-maximizing level for airlines in both the pandemic and the post-pandemic periods, and a government subsidy reduces social welfare. Competition in the passenger market or the cargo market increases conversion rates under both the airline optimum and social optimum, and widens the gap between them. However, if the airlines can influence the air cargo transport price, conversion rates may be higher under the social optimum than under the airline optimum. Competition in the passenger market and the cargo market has opposite effects on the two optimal conversion rates. When the expected cargo market size is small (large), the conversion rates in the social optimum are lower (higher) than the airline optimums, and a government subsidy worsens (enhances) social welfare. Finally, we extend our model by incorporating more real-world factors, such as the lower efficiency of preighters than that of freighters, the freighter leasing market and airlines’ lay-up of idle passenger aircraft. Most of our analytical results remain valid.",0965-8564,Not found

A better understanding of the potential for a transition to more sustainable transport behaviour requires more knowledge about the differences in car use between individuals and leisure trip purposes. As a basis for this, individuals were clustered into six car-oriented and five non-car-oriented leisure mobility segments based on data from a one-month app-based travel survey. The clusters differ substantially with respect to the cluster-forming variables including car trip characteristics, mode choice, and leisure trip purposes. The clusters also differ regarding spatial, sociodemographic, and socioeconomic characteristics, especially between car-oriented and non-car-oriented clusters. However, for self-reported data about priorities in life and basic human values there are no major differences between the clusters. One interesting finding is that car-oriented and non-car-oriented clusters make leisure trips to the same extent, indicating that both groups have a similar wish or need to travel for leisure purposes but that they choose different transport modes to get to their destinations. Also, there is great variety in car use even among the car-oriented clusters.

The proposed model further considers monetary penalties from truck late arrivals at the destinations. Multiple network instances are developed and used to evaluate the proposed model.

Among the traders, significant variation across individuals’ value of time (VOT) was observed. Results based on a negative lognormal distribution show the median in-vehicle VOTs for the air taxi mode was about 25 USD/hour, but 10 percent had VOTs higher than 64 USD/hour.

Re-envisioning the Park-and-Ride concept for the automated vehicle (AV) era with Private-to-Shared AV transfer stations,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104009,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Cities implemented park-and-ride (PNR) systems to decrease congestion in dense urban areas while providing transit options to travelers who live in a city's low- to medium-density regions. The success of PNR systems is mixed, as they suffer from several disadvantages, namely, the uncertainty of parking locations and infrequent and/or unreliable transit services, and the fact that travelers still need to walk to their destination. Motivated by the premise of PNR systems and the potential of automated vehicles (AVs), to address each of the shortcomings of PNR systems, this study proposes a future system with near-ubiquitous AVs where travelers transfer from privately owned AVs (PAVs) to shared-use, shared-ride AVs (SAVs), called a PAV-SAV transfer system. This study proposes a modeling framework to assess the potential market share of the PAV-SAV transfer system and the network impacts (e.g., congestion, vehicle miles traveled) of the proposed system. Finally, the study identifies good designs for the PAV-SAV transfer system using scenario analysis. The critical design variables are the location of transfer stations, the capacity of SAVs, and the transfer station connector links. For the Greater Los Angeles area, the computational results show a market share for PAV-SAV of almost 18% for person trips terminating in downtown Los Angeles. In all scenarios, the proposed PAV-SAV system decreases vehicle hours traveled (VHT) across the whole network with significant decreases in the urban core. For all designs, the PAV-SAV system decreases vehicle miles traveled (VMT) compared to a network without PAV-SAV transfer stations, albeit only slightly. Locating transfer stations closer to the urban core, increasing vehicle capacities, and connecting transfer stations to both arterial links and highway links improves network performance (i.e., VMT and VHT) and increases the market share of the PAV-SAV system.",0965-8564,Not found
Bikesharing and equity: A nationwide study of bikesharing accessibility in the U.S,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103983,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Bikesharing has gained global popularity as a sustainable and healthy mobility option in recent years. However, concerns have been raised about the unequal distribution of bikesharing benefits among different geographic areas and social groups. This study aims to assess bikesharing equity at the census block group (CBG) level in 73 U.S. cities as of July 2022, utilizing a non-parametric generalized additive mixed model (GAMM). Our findings indicate that bikesharing equity varies depending on the indicators used to identify disadvantaged communities. We find that bikesharing is equitable for zero-vehicle communities, as they experience higher levels of accessibility. However, for communities characterized by high levels of deprivation and a significant concentration of minorities, females, youth, and senior populations, bikesharing is inequitable, as these disadvantaged communities have limited access to bikesharing stations compared to their more privileged counterparts. These results emphasize the need for future bikesharing equity programs to prioritize expanding service into underserved disadvantaged communities through installing new stations or transitioning into hybrid systems. In addition, this study suggests using Area Deprivation Index scores over 80 and minority population shares exceeding 70% as thresholds to identify disadvantaged communities, which accounted for 13.5% of the CBGs included in our analysis. Furthermore, gender inequality should be considered in transportation planning efforts.",0965-8564,Not found
"How does high-speed rail affect off-site investments? Evidence from the Yangtze River Delta, China",10.1016/j.tra.2024.103978,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This study investigates the influence of high-speed rail (HSR) on off-site investments (OSI) in the context of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomeration. Using a comprehensive dataset of OSI activities between 2008 and 2018, we employ negative binomial regression models to examine the heterogeneous effects of HSR on OSI. Our findings reveal significant positive effects of HSR on OSI in the central region of the YRD, with shorter HSR travel times and higher train frequencies further enhancing these effects. We find that medium-sized enterprises, non-state-owned enterprises, and firms in the producer service industry exhibit greater responsiveness to HSR in terms of OSI. We also observe the coexistence of both siphon and diffusion effects of HSR on OSI in the YRD, with the diffusion effect dominating. This suggests that HSR primarily promotes OSI flows from developed areas to less developed areas, contributing to regional integration and reducing disparities. Lastly, we find that the factor flow (specifically labours and innovations), agglomeration externality, and market potential play significant mediating roles in HSR’s impacts on OSI. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between HSR and OSI, providing valuable insights for policymakers in the central region of the YRD and similar regions. We highlight the importance of context-sensitive approaches when coordinating HSR development with other regional policies. And we underscore the need for policymakers to make a balance between short-term and long-lagged-term considerations when maximizing the benefits of HSR.",0965-8564,Not found
"Transport stakeholders’ perceptions of Mobility-as-a-Service: A Q-study of cultural shift proponents, policy advocates and technology supporters",10.1016/j.tra.2024.103964,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Digitalisation along with the emerging realisation that car-centric design and ‘predict and provide’ policies failed in environmental and socio-economic terms, have encouraged the transport industry to revisit sustainable traffic management. Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is a transport intervention, still in its infancy, promising, in theory at least, significant benefits for societies by disengaging travel from automobility via a ‘one-stop digital shop’ offering integrated multimodal transport services. However, these benefits, ranging from improved and more affordable access to transport to less motorised traffic and pollution, largely depend on how stakeholders will choose to adopt, deliver and manage this intervention. Identifying and understanding the distinct perceptions of a diverse spectrum of stakeholders around MaaS may therefore help in efforts to create a formula that will allow building schemes that are attractive to users and effective operationally. This study uses for the first time for the context of MaaS the powerful semi-quantitative Q-method with a sample of 50 expert participants from 17 countries to collect, contextualise and prioritise their key insights. These stakeholders are governmental representants, transport consultants, leading academics and researchers working directly or indirectly on MaaS and sustainable/shared mobility programmes. Our analysis led to the identification of three factors (i.e., clusters of respondents with similar views), each with their specific priorities and preferences, namely: the Cultural Shift Proponents, the Policy Advocates, and the Technology Supporters. The Cultural Shift Proponents see the introduction of MaaS as part of a cultural shift away from automobility, Policy Advocates recognise the predominant role of rules and regulations in pushing forward this paradigm, and the Technology Supporters see technology integration as a facilitator to its success. This study highlights the limited governmental involvement in MaaS planning and delivery, the absence of a clear plan when it comes to mobility providers, the need to provide well-branded, sustainable and inclusive schemes for commuters, tourists and vulnerable users including awareness-raising activities, and the importance of keeping user costs modest and usage data safe.",0965-8564,Not found
An emission control policymaking model for sustainable river transportation,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104005,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Sustainable river transportation is an important component in the development of green transportation. Emission control policymaking in rivers is a key measure for realizing sustainable river transportation. Transportation demand for an origin–destination pair of cities along a river may involve transferring between land transportation and water transportation. This study takes this into account by using a mathematical programming methodology to propose a model for emission control policymaking for sustainable river transportation that minimizes the total emissions produced by both land transportation and river transportation. The model supports government regulators in making heterogeneous emission control area (ECA) policies for a river, which is shown to be superior to a traditional homogeneous ECA policy. A branch-and-bound algorithm is also developed to solve the model. Using two of China’s main rivers, a case study is conducted to derive computational results that may be potentially useful for government regulators in policymaking.",0965-8564,Not found

The data is obtained from a stated preference survey involving 250 residents in Canberra, Australia. Respondents’ mode choice behaviour and their propensity to switch from their current mode of transport to an integrated system are collected and modelled using a hierarchical latent class approach to account for taste heterogeneity and attribute non-attendance. The results show higher propensity of mode shift is associated with young age, high educational attainment, high scooter ownership and low car ownership.

Assessing effects of pandemic-related policies on individual public transit travel patterns: A Bayesian online changepoint detection based framework,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104003,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"During a pandemic or natural disaster, people may alter transit usage behavior due to perception of changes in the environment. To effectively respond to these crises, it is important for governments and public transit agencies to understand when these changes occurred and how they were affected by relevant policies and responsive strategies. In this study, we develop a methodological framework based on Bayesian online changepoint detection (BOCD) to identify the occurrence time, direction, and persistency of changes in individual-level transit usage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in informing government decision-making in the context of COVID-19. Using Jeju Island, South Korea as a case study, we apply the framework over a nearly two-year smart card dataset collected from the beginning of 2019 till nine months into the pandemic. By focusing on frequent transit users, we detect when these users significantly changed their transit usage frequency during the pandemic and identify several types of users who experienced different behavior change patterns. Besides demonstrating the great heterogeneity in individual-level behavior changes, we perform a regression analysis to further understand how these changes were affected by key government policies (e.g., Risk alert, Social distancing, Public transit policy, and Eased social distancing). Our results suggest that only certain sets of policies appear to have significant effects. In particular, introducing Risk alert would cause a 277% to 317% increase in the number of users who reduced transit usage frequency. Policies that eased social distancing, though, would cause a 134% to 155% increase in the number of users with travel frequency increase. The proposed BOCD framework enables a scalable solution to identifying and understanding changes of individual transit behavior. The methodology and findings are beneficial for developing targeted policies and interventions to facilitate daily travel and public transit operations during public health crises.",0965-8564,Not found
A barrier to the promotion of app-based ridesplitting: Travelers’ ambiguity aversion in mode choice,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103971,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Ridesplitting, despite having been around for years, accounts for a low proportion of overall transportation modes. With the development of technology, app-based ridesplitting is witnessing new opportunities but its usage rate still remains poor. Intuitively, travelers’ aversion to the unreliable travel time inherent of ridesplitting may stop them from choosing it. Many studies have explored the role of risk aversion, but fewer focus on ambiguity aversion. In this study, we aim to understand travelers’ preferences for information ambiguity in shaping their choice behavior of using app-based ridesplitting. Therefore, we built up choice models of this thought to describe travelers’ behaviors in ridesplitting. Based on the models, a two-stage framework was established including field data research and experimental research testing the existence of ambiguity aversion. In the first stage, a data set containing detailed information on nearly 2.2 million trips in Chengdu, China was utilized. By the maximum likelihood method, the fitting level of unreliability model is better and the coefficient of ambiguity attitude shows the existence of ambiguity aversion. In the second stage, a stated choice experiment was designed with a variety of choice tasks to reproduce real-life scenarios. Significantly fewer ridesplitting cases happen in the ambiguous information treatment than in the certain information treatment, but risky information does not reduce the number of choosing ridesplitting significantly. The results undergo cross-validation with field research data to ensure their reliability. This study leverages travelers’ aversion to ambiguity to explain their reluctance towards ridesplitting. The findings have strong implications for relevant service platforms to prompt more travelers towards participating in ridesplitting, for example enhancing the provision of travel information to address the concerns of potential users.",0965-8564,Not found
Predicting passenger satisfaction in public transportation using machine learning models,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103995,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Enhancing the understanding of passenger satisfaction in public transportation is crucial for operators to refine transit services and to establish and elevate quality standards. While many researchers have tackled this issue using diverse tools and methods, the prevalent approach involves surveys with discrete choice models or structural equations. However, a common limitation of these models lies in their inherent assumptions and predefined relationships between dependent and independent variables. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel perspective by harnessing machine learning (ML) models to gauge and predict passenger satisfaction. ML models are advantageous when dealing with complex, non-linear relationships and massive datasets, and do not rely on predefined assumptions. Thus, in this paper, we evaluate four ML models for the prediction of ratings of the quality of transit service. These models were calibrated using data from the Transantiago bus system in Chile. Among the ML models, the Random Forest model emerges as the most effective, showcasing its ability to analyze and predict passengers’ satisfaction levels. We delve deeper into its capabilities by examining the impact of three pivotal variables on passengers’ score ratings: waiting time, bus occupation, and bus speed. The Random Forest model is able to capture threshold values for these variables that significantly influence or have no effect on passenger preferences.",0965-8564,Not found

Given the multioutput nature of the study and the presence of negative externalities, the method used is based on hyperbolic distance functions. The results obtained reveal that i) the average efficiency in the sector suggests that it is possible to increase the total number of vehicle-kilometers traveled by 29% and simultaneously reduce recorded accidents with victims by 23%, ii) there was technical progress of 16.5% during the study period, iii) reducing by one unit the number of accidents with victims would be equivalent to a monetary value of over 491 thousand euros in terms of the loss of toll revenue paid by light or heavy vehicles, and iv) the shadow price of accidents with victims allows us to determine that the optimal toll rate for heavy vehicles should be 1.62 times that of light vehicles.",0965-8564,Not found

An empirical analysis focuses on the relation between proximity to new stations and firm survival following the announcement of the extension of the orange line of the metro in Montréal (Canada) between 1996 and 2016. To do so, a Cox Proportional Hazards model is estimated using the simultaneous announcement of two potential extensions to define the treatment (new stations) and control groups (speculative stations) based on the distance to the closest stations. The model explicitly controls for anticipation and speculation effect by introducing three distinct treatment effects by period. The impact of the new metro stations appears to be mostly positive on firms’ survival probability during the construction period and after the opening of the service. The results suggest that the metro extension does have a positive influence on the survival rates of individual firms within 250 to 1,250 m. of the closest station, especially for local activities.",0965-8564,Not found
Global path preference and local response: A reward decomposition approach for network path choice analysis in the presence of visually perceived attributes,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103998,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"This study performs an attribute-level analysis of the global and local path preferences of network travelers. To this end, a reward decomposition approach is proposed and integrated into a link-based recursive (Markovian) path choice model. The approach decomposes the instantaneous reward function associated with each state–action pair into the global utility, a function of attributes globally perceived from anywhere in the network, and the local utility, a function of attributes that are only locally perceived from the current state. Only the global utility then enters the value function of each state, representing the future expected utility toward the destination. This global–local path choice model with decomposed reward functions allows us to analyze to what extent and which attributes affect the global and local path choices of agents. The study applied the proposed model to the real pedestrian path choice observations in an urban street network where the green view index was extracted as a visual streetscape quality from Google Street View images. The result revealed that pedestrians locally perceive and react to the visual streetscape quality, rather than they have the pre-trip global perception on it. Furthermore, the simulation results using the estimated models suggested the importance of location selection of interventions when policy-related attributes are only locally perceived by travelers.",0965-8564,Not found
Train stations’ impact on housing prices: Direct and indirect effects,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103979,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Investments in rail are usually expected to improve accessibility for individuals. The value of the additional accessibility is often measured by the impact on housing prices nearby. This paper analyses the City Tunnel in Southern Sweden, a major railway investment that resulted in two new train stations in 2010: the Triangeln and Hyllie train stations. A station may affect housing prices both directly and indirectly. Direct effects are the transport-related benefits (e.g., improved accessibility), while indirect effects are additional non-transportation investments that the new station attracted to the area. The direct and indirect effects generate together the total effect on housing prices. To accurately estimate the value of the accessibility provided by the new stations it is necessary to disentangle the two effects. In this paper, a hedonic difference-in-differences model is used to estimate the total and the direct effects of the train stations on housing prices. The main results indicate that (i) the total effect on housing prices within 1,000 m from the Hyllie and Triangeln train stations shows a price increase of 17% and 8%, respectively. Yet, (ii) when removing part of the indirect effects the estimates fall to 7.2%-10.4% for Hyllie and to 5.6%-6.2% for Triangeln. The results show that: (i) the value of the accessibility may be misspecified if only the total effect on housing prices is estimated, and (ii) the value of train stations may increase if combined with other investments.",0965-8564,Not found
"Faster, greener, scooter? An assessment of shared e-scooter usage based on real-world driving data",10.1016/j.tra.2024.103997,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"In recent years, few transportation modes have gained so much attention so quickly as shared e-scooters. Debates focus on usage patterns over shift effects to environmental impacts. Previous research has mainly been conducted in Asia and North America and in metropolitan areas. Potential interdependencies have been analysed mostly towards public transport (PT). Surprisingly, investigations concerning the usage of shared e-scooters and other shared mobility services have been scarce. However, understanding possible (inter-)dependencies and potentials for inter- and multimodality is crucial for policymakers and transport planners to design efficient and sustainable transportation systems. This is why we draw on an original data set of 118,047 shared e-scooter trips in Karlsruhe, a non-metropolitan city in southwest Germany and add information about carsharing and PT. Apart from station information for both modes, we add departure information for tramways, and weather data. Shared e-scooter data is retrieved via the local providers from November 2020 to April 2021, information about the stations of carsharing and PT is added via OpenStreetMap, and tramway service data is retrieved via the local authority. We find an average trip distance of 1.40 km and substantially less usage on Sundays. The potential of combining shared e-scooters is higher for PT than for carsharing. Shared e-scooter trips show longer distances in times of lower or none PT service. Negative binomial regression models with fixed effects for the PT or carsharing stations show that the number of tram departures positively affects shared e-scooter usage, particularly at off-peak times. Applying mode shift scenarios and focusing on the usage phase, the energy consumption effect of shared e-scooters is found to be between − 5 to +0.5 TWh. However, it requires providers to revisit their operations and policy to rethink regulation to get even close to the multimodal or energy consumption potential.",0965-8564,Not found
Understanding the expectations of parents regarding their children's school commuting by public transport using latent Dirichlet Allocation,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103986,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Parents’ perceptions regarding public transport and active modes influence the youth's acceptance and support for sustainable school commuting.

This paper proposes a methodology utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract valuable information from open-ended survey responses, shedding light on parents' expectations regarding their children's school commute via PT. Analyzing responses from two surveys involving 448 households, with a focus on parents in the Lisbon Metro Area, spanning the school years of 2017–2018 and 2018–2019, and pre-and post-field interventions, our study employs LDA to assess households' criticisms and recommendations for improving public transport services. Our findings illustrate a shift from general criticisms in the initial survey to proactive suggestions in the subsequent one, aligning with marketing efforts to foster more sustainable school commuting with PT. Empirically, our study underscores LDA's efficacy in capturing users' feedback often neglected by closed-ended questions. Effective preprocessing of textual data facilitates streamlined field interventions.

Far less consideration is given to the potential pedestrian/bicyclist safety-related implications of macro-level walkability. Making it desirable to walk and bike without providing the proper physical environment to make it safe is clearly problematic. This study assessed the links between neighborhood walkability and pedestrian/bicyclist traffic fatalities across metropolitan areas in the U.S. We integrated and harnessed geocoded data on pedestrian/bicyclist and all mode traffic fatalities, travel behavior exposures (use of sedentary and active travel modes), sociodemographic, and control variables. Associations of pedestrian/bicyclist traffic fatality rates with walkability characteristics were estimated using multilevel Tobit models with treatment for hierarchical unobserved regional and state variations. Walkability index (mixed land use, street intersection density, and transit accessibility) was positively correlated with pedestrian/bicyclist fatality rates after adjusting for travel exposures, sociodemographic controls, and regional and state-level unobserved variations. A unit increase in the walkability index was associated with a 4.9% increase (95% CI: 4.2%, 5.7%) in pedestrian/bicyclist fatality rates. Conversely, the walkability index was negatively correlated with total or all-mode fatality rates. The positive association between walkability and pedestrian/bicyclist fatality rates appeared robust in different sensitivity analyses. Despite non-linearities, neighborhoods with greater population using active travel modes for commute had on-average higher pedestrian/bicyclist fatality rates. The reverse was true for neighborhoods with greater teleworking population. Neighborhoods with greater prevalence of black, low-income, and younger adults had on-average higher pedestrian/bicyclist fatality rates. Results emphasize the need to develop new conceptual definitions of walkability that consider safety within the built environments. Our results highlight the importance of understanding how pedestrian/bicyclist supportive design can be used to maximize the positive health benefits of walkability while reducing the risk of pedestrian/bicyclist deaths. Findings also suggest the need to enhance existing walkability assessment techniques (indices) to predict and simulate how different investments impact pedestrian/bicyclist safety.

Do we all need shared E-scooters? An accessibility-centered spatial equity evaluation approach,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103985,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Shared E-scooters were introduced as a sustainable mode of transport that could help reduce motorized traffic externalities; however, problems, such as inequitable use, emerged shortly after the start of their operations. While existing literature has focused primarily on user and vehicle characteristics as the main drivers of E-scooter inequitable use, it fails to understand or capture other factors that impact travel decisions, such as urban design and activity accessibility. This study proposes a framework to evaluate shared (E-)scooters’ equity based on accessibility or lack of accessibility to different activities compared to other existing modes of transportation. To test the proposed framework, a sensitivity analysis tested various scenarios using data from scooter trips in Louisville, Kentucky. In total, 1903 main scenarios and 7612 sub-scenarios were evaluated, focusing on accessibility gains for different social groups, modes of transport that could be replaced by scooters, and different locations within the study area. As a result, scooters have the potential to improve current levels of accessibility in 8% of the examined scenarios, mostly when replacing uni–modal walking, biking, and public transportation trips. Furthermore, disadvantaged groups did not gain significant accessibility advantages compared to the rest of the population. We argue that the observed inequitable use of scooters is inherited from the urban structure and activity density. In areas with fewer activities, where mostly disadvantaged social groups live, people use E-scooters less. In order to make E-scooters a competitive mode of transport in disadvantaged areas, urban structural solutions such as densification of land use and promotion of different activities should be considered first.",0965-8564,Not found
Ride-sourcing demand in Metro Vancouver: Looking through the lens of disability,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103984,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The availability of ride-sourcing services provided by Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) can improve access to opportunities for persons with disabilities. This segment of the population, which tends to have fewer transportation options, can benefit from the on-demand and flexible nature of ride-sourcing. Despite the potential for ride-sourcing to improve equitable access, little research exists on the use of ride-sourcing by persons with disabilities and its influence on their use of other modes. To address this gap, this study focuses on understanding the characteristics of ride-sourcing trips made by persons with disabilities and the factors influencing their substitution of public transit and taxis. Using survey data collected in the Metro Vancouver area, this study also compares the behaviour of persons with and without disabilities. Results indicate a larger share of ride-sourcing adopters among persons with disabilities and that ride-sourcing is used more frequently by this group compared to persons without disabilities. Empirical models reveal little overlap between the factors that influence these two population groups' replacements of public transit and taxis. Some of the significant factors influencing the use of TNCs in place of transit and taxis include age, income, transit pass ownership, going to the airport, wanting to avoid drinking and driving, faster travel times, and lower costs.

However, it faces deep issues related to pollution, congestion, and safety. Understanding the driving patterns of paratransit in SSA can provide valuable insights into the transportation needs in the region, which is particularly relevant nowadays given the increasing focus on sustainable transportation solutions in Africa. Representative driving cycles, which provide a realistic simulation of the driving conditions a vehicle is likely to encounter, are key to framing policies for effective transportation management, vehicle design, and urban and regional planning. However, cycle development has been limited in SSA due to a lack of data and standardized testing procedures. This study develops a representative driving cycle using GPS data gathered on paratransit vehicles traveling around Stellenbosch, South Africa, providing a benchmark for evaluation and a platform for further research and testing in SSA’s dominant transport industry. A novel time series shape-based clustering methodology is employed that combines dynamic time warping and mixed integer programming to cluster micro-trips of varying length based on their time series shapes. Representative micro-trips from each cluster are stitched together with a maximum likelihood approach to curate the final cycle. By including transients from the measured data in cycle development, this novel approach to cycle development is particularly suited for capturing the notoriously unconventional and aggressive driving style of paratransit. The constructed cycle and several international cycles are assessed against the measured database on the basis of eight characteristic kinematic parameters. The constructed cycle emerges as the most fitting choice to represent paratransit operating conditions, with an average deviance of 3.65% across the parameters, compared to deviations of 23%–34% for the international cycles.",0965-8564,Not found
Forecasting the development of Clean energy vehicles in large Cities: A system dynamics perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2024.103969,181,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Clean energy vehicles (CEVs), e.g., battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), are being adopted gradually to substitute for internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) around the world. The fueling infrastructure is one of the key drivers for the development of the CEV market. When the government develops funding policies to support the fueling infrastructure development for FCEVs and BEVs, it has to assess the effectiveness of different policy options and identify the optimal policy combination, which is very challenging in transportation research. In this paper, we develop a system dynamics model to study the feedback mechanism between the fueling infrastructure funding policies and the medium- to long-term diffusion of FCEVs and BEVs, and the competition between FCEVs and BEVs based on relevant policy and market data in Guangzhou, China. The results of the modeling analysis are as follows. (1) Funding hydrogen refueling stations and public charging piles has positive implications for achieving the substitution of CEVs for ICEVs. (2) Adjusting the funding ratio of hydrogen refueling stations and public charging piles or increasing the funding budget and extending the funding cycle does not have a significant impact on the overall substitution of CEVs for ICEVs but only impacts the relative competitive advantage between FCEVs and BEVs. (3) An equal share of funding for hydrogen refueling stations and public charging piles would have better strategic value for future net-zero-emissions urban transportation.

This study quantifies and measures the vulnerability of the street networks of every urban area in the world then models the relationships between vulnerability and street network design characteristics. To do so, we simulate over 2.4 billion trips across more than 8,000 urban areas in 178 countries, while also simulating network disruption events representing floods, earthquakes, and targeted attacks. We find that disrupting high-centrality nodes severely impacts network function. All else equal, networks with higher connectivity, fewer chokepoints, or less circuity are less vulnerable to disruption’s impacts. This study thus contributes a new global understanding of network design and vulnerability to the literature. We argue that these design characteristics offer high leverage points for street network resilience and robustness that planners should emphasize when designing or retrofitting urban networks.",0965-8564,Not found
A collective incentive strategy to manage ridership rebound and consumer surplus in mass transit systems,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104031,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"This paper models and analyzes a collective incentive strategy with passenger departure time equilibrium to maximize the total passenger surplus, which could further enhance the sustainability of transit systems in the post-pandemic era. In the proposed collective incentive strategy, passengers with transit passes have dynamic discounts where the discount value depends on the total number of passengers enrolled in the incentive program. A bi-level optimization model is established by considering passengers' demand elasticity and responses to the strategy, which eventually determines the starting time and duration of the collective incentive strategy during the time of the day. We further analyze the properties of the proposed collective incentive model to identify the analytical solutions and performance. Analytical results indicate that there exists a threshold demand elasticity below which the total surplus of commuters with and without transit passes can be improved simultaneously. Properties also show that there could exist multiple local optimal solutions of incentive strategy duration for a given starting time. A case study is conducted with the metro system in Toronto: the results show that the proposed collective incentive strategy could improve both the fare revenues and ridership by 33.31 % and 83.56 %, respectively.",0965-8564,Not found
Light electric vehicle sharing systems: Functional design of a comprehensive decision making solution,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104043,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"The functional design of a decision support system for a state-of-the-art vehicle sharing system (VSS) inevitably includes the selection or definition of methodologies for planning and managing the observed VSS. In this paper, our focus is on an innovative VSS that utilizes light electric vehicles. Our goal is to specify the functions of a comprehensive decision making solution for such a VSS through a qualitative and systematic literature and system analysis. To achieve this goal, we rely on the holistic VSS management framework developed in our previous research. As a result of our study, we identify possible solution methodologies or algorithms for implementing functions of the designed decision making solution, and propose the necessary adjustments for their application in the case of light electric vehicles, or note any research gap. With these findings, we provide justified guidance to practitioners in creating these solutions, with the aim of reducing development time.",0965-8564,Not found
Modeling and evaluating the travel behaviour in multimodal networks: A path-based unified equilibrium model and a tailored greedy solution algorithm,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104032,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"The modeling and efficient solution of the combined mode split and traffic assignment (CMSTA) problem serve as a powerful tool for capturing complex travel behavior in multimodal transportation networks under different planning scenarios and incentive programs. In this paper, we propose a path-based unified equilibrium condition that combines the cross-nested logit (CNL)-based mode split and the user equilibrium (UE)-based traffic assignment to address the CMSTA problem on a multimodal transportation network. The equilibrium condition is further formulated as a novel path-based variational inequality (VI) model. A general path-based algorithm framework that integrates a tailored greedy algorithm and a novel modified intelligent acceleration strategy (MIAS) is then developed for solving the proposed CMSTA model. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm in both small-size and large-scale networks. The proposed model and algorithm can help to provide some policy implications for multimodal transportation planning and management. The lessons learned from our analysis results include (1) the removal of some existing key park-and-ride (P&R) interchanges that carry more flows from the multimodal network can result in a significant increase in total travel costs, but the removal of others may instead reduce total travel costs; (2) increasing the number of P&R interchanges in a multimodal network may degrade the performance of the network, even though it may encourage the use of green travel modes.",0965-8564,Not found
Managing network congestion with link-based incentives: A surrogate-based optimization approach,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104033,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Incentive-based travel demand management (IBTDM) programs endow monetary incentives to encourage travel demand redistribution across space and time. They are more appealing than alternatives such as congestion charging because commuters do not need to pay out of pocket. However, such congestion-alleviation solutions are usually managed by small private companies with constrained incentive budgets. Thus, the incentive should be wisely determined so that a limited incentive budget can be effectively used to fulfill maximum social welfare while maintaining the financial health of the IBTDM program. It is essential to know whether IBTDM is financially sound—that is, whether financial investment in IBTDM will lead to more than the equivalent value in total system travel time reduction. However, optimizing the link-based endowment scheme in a large-scale network is challenging because 1) the objective function and the budget constraint are both characterized by expensive-to-evaluate functions without closed form, and 2) it is a large-scale optimization problem that contains massive amount of decision variables. In this study, a computationally efficient surrogate-based optimization framework that is suitable for high-dimensional problems is proposed. A simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model is used to evaluate the performance of transportation systems, and a Kriging model with partial least squares acts as the surrogate to approximate the simulation model. The results show that the optimal network-wide link-based incentive scheme improves the performance of the system. The higher the incentive budget, the more effective the incentive and the lower the marginal utility of the incentive. Furthermore, in a well-designed incentive scheme, a $1M investment in IBTDM would lead to much more than the equivalent of $1M in total system travel time reduction, which proves the economic viability of IBTDM and provides support for its promotion. IBTDM implemented within smaller regions and tighter incentive budgets produces higher utility ratios.",0965-8564,Not found
School bus transport service strategies’ policy-making mechanism – An evolutionary game approach,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104014,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"School transport services are essential to the society. As more families drive their children to school, stakeholders such as the school operators and policy-makers should work together to provide child-friendly and sustainable services like school bus transport. Given that this is a multi-stakeholder problem, it is complex to balance the objectives, for example when it comes to deciding the operators and the school bus service strategies. Currently, there is rather limited knowledge on the relevant policy-making mechanism, and the impact of public transport services used as school transport. To address this, this paper proposes a novel evolutionary game-based approach to reflect the “game” nature of this school transport operation problem and simulate the policy-making procedure, where positive external benefits, as well as intangible school benefits from green and child friendly transport are included. Essentially, the proposed approach should lead to an “equilibrium point” in term of cost-benefits and decision-makings for the involved operators. In this paper, two game players, i.e. schools and governments, are considered. It is found that (1) if both players offer services, i.e. competing, the schools tend to be conservative and stop offering services; (2) if some critical decision-making parameters such as the profit thresholds can be altered, the schools and the government can jointly operate services at “equilibrium” and maintain it sustainably. “Altering” such profit thresholds are possible via policy interventions or service designs, such as service advertisement and quality supervision.",0965-8564,Not found
An analysis of travel behavior and willingness to pay on Express Lanes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104037,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"In March 2020, governments worldwide implemented various social restriction measures, including lockdowns, to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. This led to a profound shift in travel behavior, accompanied by a notable reduction in congestion. This paper investigates travel demand on Express Lanes during two time periods: before the pandemic (from January 2020 to mid-March 2020) and during the pandemic (from mid-March 2020 to the end of May 2020). A large data set of trips observed on Express Lanes derived from transponders is combined with vehicle probe measures of travel times and used to estimate the willingness to pay to travel on Express Lanes. The analysis reveals that not all Express Lane assets are equal, with the longer Express Lane demonstrating better performance than the shorter one. Peak hours experienced a more significant impact than off-peak hours, reflecting the heightened flexibility in travelers' schedules during the pandemic. The proposed econometric model quantifies the increase in willingness to pay for Express Lanes, which went up to $36 and $34 per hour on the two assets from the values of $26 and $28 per hour estimated before the pandemic, which can be justified by the observed lower market shares during the pandemic.",0965-8564,Not found
The shipping industry under the EU Green Deal: An Input-Output impact analysis,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104035,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"In 2021, the European Commission introduced the ‘Fit for 55’ package, a set of policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% by the year 2030. This initiative, aligned with the European Green Deal, seeks to make Europe a climate-neutral continent by 2050. A pivotal aspect of ‘Fit for 55’ is the proposed extension of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) to the shipping industry. According to the European Commission, water transport accounts for 2.5% of global GHG emissions, while the shipping industry accounts for 13% of the EU’s GHG emissions from transportation. This stringent new shipping policy makes it imperative to determine how the world’s economy will respond, considering three distinct implementation proposals with different rates of policy introduction. Evaluating the short-term impacts of the policy is crucial to ensuring that the sustainability initiative is not only ambitious but also pragmatic and adaptable to the realities. To assess the implications, this paper uses the Leontief price model, the environmental input–output (EIO) model, and the OECD Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) Table for 2018, which contains information for 45 sectors. The focus is on EU countries and its Top 10 Trading Countries. Our findings show that a short-term trade-off exists between economic and environmental goals and that environmental gains incur economic losses for key stakeholders. They also show that the impact of this policy is felt more by producers in the EU and consumers in non-EU countries than by other agents in the respective countries. Lastly, a recommendation from our study is that the policy should be phased in progressively to provide economic agents with the necessary adjustment time and thus minimize economic losses.",0965-8564,Not found
Commuting vs teleworking: How does it impact the relationship between commuting satisfaction and subjective well-being,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104041,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"While the relationship between commuting satisfaction (CS) and subjective well-being (SWB) has been extensively studied, less attention is given to explaining how CS affects SWB via satisfaction with non-travel-related life domains. Failure to account for these spillover effects of life domains other than commuting has certainly led to an overestimation of the impact from CS to SWB. This study aims to address this gap and examine the recent changes in commuting practices/working conditions, particularly the increase in working from home (WFH) due to the pandemic. A structural equation model is employed to examine differences in WFH frequencies and their impact on the relationship between CS, satisfaction with other life domains and SWB. The results suggest that hybrid teleworkers exhibit highest SWB and occasional WFH individuals have the lowest levels of SWB. Moreover, the effect of CS on SWB is mediated first by time satisfaction (TUS) and then by other life domains, highlighting the dominance of TUS on the relationship between CS and SWB regardless of WFH frequency. These findings help to identify not only areas where employee SWB can be improved, but also how.",0965-8564,Not found
Unraveling the diversity in transit-oriented development,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104020,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Transit-oriented development (TOD) is widely recognized for its potential to create high-density, mixed-use, and pedestrian-friendly environments. It aims to reduce reliance on cars, promote non-motorized travel, and advocate the utilization of various transportation modes. Due to these expected benefits, TOD has gained popularity and widespread adoption across cities. However, not all transit areas are developed according to TOD principles. Therefore, this study aims to identify different types of TOD in the United States and examine travel behavior of residents within each type. By capturing the diverse conditions of 4,400 existing transit station areas across the United States, this study reveals four TOD types: business district, town center, neighborhood, and suburban station areas. Using data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, this study identifies variations in residents’ travel behavior, encompassing mode share and multimodality across these TOD types. The findings highlight the need for tailored strategies in specific contexts and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of TODs.

Public-Transportation Credits: The potential of three-part tariffs in public transportation,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104022,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"In December 2023, public-transportation providers in Switzerland introduced Public-Transportation Credits (PTCs). PTCs are credits (or “allowances”) that are greater in amount than their price and can be used to purchase any type of public-transportation tickets within a year. With the initial fixed payment, the subsequent use of the allowance and the eventual return to the standard fare, PTCs represent three-part tariff models. We explore the potential of PTCs to target particularly elastic segments of the demand curve, simultaneously allowing for increased consumption and higher revenue. To assess the revenue impact of the PTC empirically, we analyze a pilot study conducted by the Swiss public-transportation providers. In a randomized field experiment with 200,000 PTC invitees and 911 actual PTC buyers, we use the dispach of invitations as an instrumental variable. While observing substantial revenue increases, this result is insignificant due to the weak relationship between invitees and buyers. Therefore, we complement our analysis with a selection-on-observable approach, utilizing machine-learning techniques to match PTC buyers to customers in the control group. This way, we reveal a highly significant treatment effect, indicating a revenue enhancement of CHF179.7 per PTC (approximately USD200). Leveraging our comprehensive dataset and insights from a non-buyer survey, we predict a demand of around 200,000 units for the market-launch version of the PTC.",0965-8564,Not found
Policy analysis for sustainable EV charging facility adoption using SEM-ANN approach,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104036,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Researchers often reported that the non-availability of public charging infrastructure is the primary concern in adopting electric vehicles (EVs) in India. Adopting a home charging facility would help at the preliminary stage of EV introduction, where there is less scope for public charging infrastructure. In addition, integrating the solar rooftop photovoltaic (PV) facility to generate electricity for EV charging would help to develop a sustainable change in the transport sector. Thus, this study aims to identify various influencing factors that affect individual householder's decisions to adopt a home charging facility supported by a rooftop PV system for EV charging. Also, this study identifies and prioritises the most suitable policy options to encourage users to adopt EVs, including home EV charging supported by rooftop PV facilities. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was conducted with individual householders in Ahmedabad, India, and 850 samples were used for the analysis. An integrated partial least squares-structural equation modelling with the artificial neural network method was adopted in this study. The study's findings reveal that the comfort and convenience of charging a vehicle at home, reduced range anxiety, comparatively lesser charging cost, flexibility to charge the vehicle, and no waiting to charge the vehicle are significant motivating factors for adopting a home charging facility. The willingness to adopt a rooftop PV system positively influences EV charging at home. In addition, providing a combined incentive to install home EV charging and a rooftop PV facility is the most preferred policy option. The outcome of this study would significantly help transport planners, policymakers, and researchers develop effective strategies and policies to boost EV sales in the Indian context.",0965-8564,Not found
Daily schedule changes in the automated vehicle era: Uncovering the heterogeneity behind the veil of low survey commitment,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104006,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Automated vehicles (AVs) may transform not only our travel experience but our complete daily schedules. This study analyses the data from an interactive stated activity-travel survey using latent class cluster analysis to uncover the types and prevalence of schedule changes with AVs. The analysis reveals that the majority of respondents expected little to no changes in their schedules. Importantly however, these responses are correlated with low commitment to the survey, evident in unrealistically short response times to non-central survey parts and simpler representations of their current schedules. The remaining responses reveal significant and varied changes in activities on board and outside travel, and in commute departure times. We conclude that the prevalence of schedule changes may be underestimated in our and possibly other AV studies due to low survey commitment. Our findings also highlight diverse potential motivations behind schedule changes with AVs: while some travellers may desire to free up time for other activities during the day (time saving), others may satisfy an unmet activity need by engaging in on-board activities (time spending). Considering this heterogeneity is crucial in endeavours to quantify the total benefits and costs that automated vehicles will bring to their users.",0965-8564,Not found

Moreover, the pandemic has decreased in-person interaction, necessitating contactless technologies. The autonomous delivery robot (ADR) is one such contactless technology used in last-mile delivery (LMD). Hence, consumers’ acceptance of ADRs in last-mile service must be studied to promote the use of this innovative technology. This study investigates the factors influencing customers’ acceptance of ADRs in LMD and aid in resource allocation to encourage acceptance. A combination of resource-matching theory, perceived value theory, and perceived risk theory was applied to develop the theoretical model. The central premise is that customers’ intentions are motivated by the characteristics of ADRs, such as compatibility, reliability, privacy security, and convenience, through the channels of enhanced perceived value and lower perceived risk.. An online survey with 500 respondents was conducted in Singapore and structural model equation analysis was performed. The findings revealed that the effects of compatibility, convenience, privacy security, and reliability on consumer intention are fully mediated by perceived value and risk.

Designing corporate mobility as a service – Decision support and perspectives,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104011,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Corporate Mobility as a Service (CMaaS) integrates company-exclusive fleets and public mobility services, such as car sharing, bike sharing, or taxis, into one multimodal mobility system. As a result, companies may reduce their own vehicle fleet, their total mobility costs, as well as their emissions by shifting trips to alternative mobility modes. Against this background, we present a strategic-tactical decision support tool for corporate mobility managers to design a CMaaS system. We include strategic decisions on the fleet size and composition of company-exclusive fleets. The fleet composition addresses decisions on the inclusion of various mobility modes, e.g., cars and bikes, as well as on the choice of vehicle classes, e.g., regarding drive train technologies, and on how these vehicles are provided to the company, e.g., leased or owned vehicles. Further, we include tactical decisions on the choice of price tariffs offered by public mobility providers. Herein, our decision support tool accounts for structural requirements, such as the spatio-temporal corporate mobility demand, costs, upper bounds on the number of vehicles, technical vehicle restrictions, and the use of micromobility modes, like bikes and scooters. Finally, a comprehensive case study with ten mobility services and driving profiles of 144 companies enables us to draw general insights on the current and future potentials of CMaaS.

Few studies have explored the package delivery acceptance behavior of passengers engaged in PT-based CS initiatives while passengers’ behavioral intention to participate (i.e., engage) is not studied. It is requisite that newly introduced CS platforms explore their potential crowdshippers’ behavior on intention to participate and set efficient marketing strategies. Given survey data collected from 2208 PT passengers in Sydney metropolitan area, this study explores the intention of PT passengers as crowd-shippers to participate in PT-based CS initiatives, as well as prohibiting factors in way of participation. Accordingly, a binominal logit model is developed whereby the variables impacting the intention to participate are identified. Then, using an inductive thematic analysis, 917 reasons (text responses) for not participating are scrutinized, and the prohibiting factors are identified and categorized. Considering demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the respondents, the study reveals to what degree passengers with different characteristics are sensitive to prohibiting factors. This research provides several practical insights that can assist in successfully defining, launching, and advertising a new PT-based CS initiative. As a key finding, it is observed that women, full-time employees, elderly, retirees, and low-income PT passengers hardly participate, while the youth, individuals with a positive attitude towards sustainable freight initiatives, and those who experienced working with parcel lockers would participate with a higher probability. Moreover, it is observed that factors relating to time availability/flexibility and physical health condition/importance of passengers are much more important than the compensation level for passengers to accept to participate in PT-based CS initiatives.",0965-8564,Not found
Examining the roles of transport captivity and travel dissonance in travel satisfaction,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104023,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Despite the increasing studies examining the determinants of travel satisfaction, the role of individuals’ transport mobility (i.e., access to different mobility tools) in travel satisfaction has not received much research attention. Previous travel satisfaction studies mostly consider travel as a free choice. However, travel satisfaction may also depend on the availability of travel options, which is supposed to be limited especially for captive travelers. Such travel captivity may affect the perception of travel either directly by shaping the expectations and feelings in travel, or indirectly via the resulted travel mode consonance/dissonance. It may also influence people’s sensitivity to travel features by determining one’s travel experiences, which serve as reference points in travel evaluation. This paper aims to identify the role of mobility in travel satisfaction by investigating both the independent and joint effects of travel captivity and travel mode dissonance on travel satisfaction using data from a household travel survey conducted in 2018 in Shanghai, China. Descriptive analyses show that travel captivity and travel dissonance are positively associated for car commuters, but not transit commuters. We then develop linear regression models and find that travel captivity has a negative effect on transit commuters’ travel satisfaction, but no or positive impact on that of car commuters. Besides, captive transit commuters are more tolerant to travel mode dissonance when rating travel satisfaction, while the opposite holds true for car commuters. The research findings highlight the importance of mobility in travel satisfaction and provide support to the development of multimodal transport systems.",0965-8564,Not found
Trip misreporting mining and expansion method for household travel survey,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104015,182,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Trip misreporting involves respondents omitting or concealing actual travel activities during the household travel survey (HTS) process. This paper investigated the trip misreporting mining method within the context of HTS by integrating mobile phone signaling data. Additionally, a data-driven approach was proposed to expand the HTS sample by incorporating trip misreporting and travel characteristics, including travel purpose and mode. The first step involved identifying stationary points through mobile phone signaling data and matching them with HTS data to uncover instances of trip misreporting. Subsequently, Point of Interest (POI) data was utilized to identify travel purposes. By integrating travel characteristic indicators from mobile phone signaling data, a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Light-GBM) was employed for estimating travel modes. Lastly, a novel method for weighted combination expansion sampling was introduced. This method integrates traditional household and person samples with travel purposes and modes. The study revealed that in Suzhou, China, 23% of total trips went unrecorded in HTS due to trip misreporting. The accuracy of identifying travel purpose and estimating travel mode was 86.9% and 84%, respectively. Compared to the traditional method, this approach yielded a more accurate representation of actual travel distance and time. This reduced the distribution error by 7.4% and 6.2%, respectively. Additionally, six days of metro smart card data from weekdays, weekends, and holidays were utilized to validate daily passenger volume after sample expansion, resulting in a daily bias rate below 5%. The findings can effectively uncover the phenomenon of trip misreporting within HTS and provide innovative approaches to expanding the survey data, thereby enabling a more comprehensive analysis of the urban travel patterns.",0965-8564,Not found

We use five mobility indicators to portray the travel behavior of older adults: whether or not a trip is made at all on the survey day (i.e., mobile or not); number of trips per day for mobile individuals; km of travel per day for mobile individuals; modal distribution of trips; and trip purpose. In analyzing the travel behavior of older adults, we grouped them into 5-year age categories: from 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, 75–79, and then 80+ years. In addition to a descriptive, graphical analysis, we employ multi-level multiple regression analysis to examine factors that may affect the mobility of older adults. Mobility levels generally declined with increasing age in both countries in both years, but the declines were gradual, except for a steep drop for the 80+ age group. Mobility levels in 2001 were generally higher for all age groups in the USA than in Germany, especially for older adults. By 2017, however, the gap between the two countries diminished because mobility increased more for all age groups in Germany than in the USA from 2001/2002 to 2017. Indeed, Germans of all age groups in 2017 were more likely than Americans to make at least one trip during their travel day. The largest increases in mobility in both countries were for the oldest age categories (75–79 and 80+). From 2002 to 2017, the share of car trips among older adults in Germany rose considerably, while it fell slightly in the USA from 2001 to 2017. Nevertheless, car dependence among the oldest adults in 2017 was still twice as high in the USA as in Germany. One reason for Germany’s lower modal share of driving is that the transport system in Germany offers far more attractive alternatives to car use than in the USA, while policies at every government level make car ownership, parking and use more expensive and more difficult than in the USA.",0965-8564,Not found
Seismic resilience assessment of interdependent urban transportation-electric power system under uncertainty,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104078,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Transportation system (TS) and electric power system (EPS) play crucial roles in the functioning of modern societies.

In this paper, the urban waterlogging-induced road traffic safety risk (UWRTSR) in the central part of Beijing was assessed and its driving factors were investigated. We obtained the simulation data of road inundation for five rainstorm return periods (5-year, 10-year, 20-year, 50-year and 100-year) through the InfoWorks ICM hydrodynamic model. Then, the safety risk levels of pedestrians and vehicles are evaluated with safety criteria formulas and standards, and the driving factors are identified by the Geodetector model. The results show that the proportion of the total length of road sections at different risk levels for pedestrians, stationary vehicles and moving vehicles increased with increasing rainstorm return period, while for the same road section, the risk level for pedestrians or vehicles may increase due to a higher intensity rainstorm event. The results of subsequent driving factor analysis show that slope, terrain ruggedness index (TRI) and LS factor were the top three single-factor explanatory powers, with the joint effect of slope and rain pipe capacity (RPC) possessing the largest explanatory power.

It is essential to develop resilient multi-modal public transportation systems, and a reasonable resilience assessment framework serves as the foundation for developing such systems. In this paper, we propose a resilience assessment framework based on performance-based measurement metrics. We develop a dynamic simulation procedure that considers the impacts of disruptions on passenger choices of path and departure time. By incorporating these features into the simulation procedure, we can effectively model the variations of passenger flow under disruptions. Finally, to demonstrate the proposed resilience assessment framework and dynamic simulation procedure, the multi-modal public transportation system in Beijing is considered as a case study. The results reveal that the system exhibits good resistance and recovery capabilities, but it lacks robustness. Additionally, we discuss the effects of downtime, bus frequency, bus bridging services, and proportions of commuters on resilience, which lead to several valuable policy implications.",0965-8564,Not found
DeepAD: An integrated decision-making framework for intelligent autonomous driving,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104069,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize intelligent transportation by improving traffic safety, increasing energy efficiency, and reducing congestion. In this study, a novel framework termed DeepAD was proposed and validated for decision making in intelligent autonomous driving via deep reinforcement learning. This framework incorporates multiple driving objectives such as efficiency, safety, and comfort to make informed decisions regarding autonomous vehicles (AVs). The decision-making process utilizes the origin–destination information for macrolevel routing and determines microlevel car-following and lane-changing behaviors. The lane-changing behavior is discretized and learned through a deep Q-network, and the continuous car-following behavior is learned through a deep deterministic policy gradient. Comprehensive simulation experiments on a real-world network demonstrated that DeepAD outperformed human driving while maintaining a desirable level of efficiency, safety, and comfort. In the real-world road networks experiment, multiple indexes of vehicles in the high AVs penetration rate group significantly outperformed that of the group with lower AVs penetration rate. Overall, the proposed framework provides insights into intelligent autonomous driving to improve urban mobility.",0965-8564,Not found
Designing taxi ridesharing systems with shared pick-up and drop-off locations: Insights from a computational study,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104063,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Taxi ridesharing (TRS) systems are considered one means towards more sustainable transportation by increasing car occupancy rates and thereby significantly improving the efficiency of urban transportation systems. In this study, we consider TRS with shared pick-up and drop-off locations, where customers of a shared trip might be required to walk a short distance from their origin/to their destination. Related research has discussed the advantages of this approach over other TRS variants, including shorter travel times, lower fuel consumption and fewer emissions. However, these studies do not investigate how a TRS ought to be designed under different environmental conditions to maximize its effectiveness in terms of rejection and sharing rate. We contribute to closing this gap with three achievements. First, we propose a new mathematical model that provides a conceptualization of the TRS problem with shared pick-up and drop-off locations. Second, we implement a rolling horizon approach and conduct extensive computational experiments based on empirical data from New York City and Porto. In our experiments, we vary and combine several exogeneous (environmental) and design-oriented factors and show that both exert considerable influence on the rejection rate, sharing rate and service quality. Third, for practitioners considering a TRS with shared pick-up and drop-off locations, our guidelines highlight the importance of system design, particularly in leveraging extended waiting times to attain low rejection rates and foster high sharing rates.",0965-8564,Not found
Urban network geofencing with dynamic speed limit policy via deep reinforcement learning,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104067,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Urban environment and mobility are threatened by traffic congestion due to the growth in the number of vehicles and urbanization. To address this problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL) urban network geofencing (UNG) strategy for traffic management to improve traffic operations and sustainability. The proposed solution creates a real-time geofence that consists of several sub-networks where dynamic speed limit policies are implemented. The road links in each sub-network share the same speed limit policy in a control cycle. An actor-critic framework is developed to learn the discrete speed limits of sub-networks in a continuous action space, and a reward function is developed based on the average speeds of vehicles on the network. A twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) method is introduced for calibrating the actor-critic networks and solving the overestimation bias problem arising with the function approximation. Based on the traffic simulation of a real-world local network in Shanghai, the performance of the geofencing methods is investigated in various scenarios characterized by different levels of traffic demand and control settings. The findings suggest that the proposed TD3-UNG controller is capable of generating beneficial dynamic speed limit policies to reduce total time spent, emissions, and fuel consumption in various scenarios.",0965-8564,Not found
Consortium blockchain in Shipping: Impacts on industry and social welfare,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104071,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"This paper investigates the effects of consortium blockchain on the shipping industry. We model a market with two competing shipping lines and a port. We compare three scenarios: no blockchain (NB), partial blockchain consisting of only the two shipping lines (PB), and full blockchain consisting of both the shipping lines and the port (FB). Using game theory, we analyze how the consortium blockchain affects the shipping market and social welfare. We find that adding more players (especially the port) to the consortium blockchain does not always benefit everyone. The port gains from joining the consortium blockchain if its adoption cost is low. But compared with PB, FB generally decreases the profit of the shipping line with information advantage. PB enhances social welfare regardless of the blockchain adoption cost, while FB does so only under fierce competition between the shipping lines. Moreover, both PB and FB increase the volatility of the shipping freight rates, although they do not affect the volatility of shipping outputs or the port charges. Our analysis reveals that policy interventions are essential to ensure that the benefits of consortium blockchain adoption are equitably distributed among all shipping industry participants. Additionally, regulatory measures may be necessary to mitigate the heightened volatility in freight rates introduced by blockchain, ensuring a stable and predictable shipping industry landscape.",0965-8564,Not found
Relax on the way to work or work on the way to relax? Influences of vehicle interior on travel time perceptions in autonomous vehicles,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104073,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The impending arrival of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has the potential to transform how individuals perceive time spent travelling. By removing the need to drive and pay attention to the road, AV users could perform other activities, including those for work or leisure. As a result, AVs are expected to lower the burden of travel and, therefore, the value of travel time (VOTT). Despite the significant impacts that AVs may have on individuals’ choices and the transportation system, few have studied their impacts on travel time perceptions, and even fewer have examined the extent to which these impacts will vary depending on the types of tasks that can be performed within an AV. This study uses stated preference data collected in Fall 2022 to develop mode choice models and subsequently quantify how the availability of three types of AV: privately-owned, exclusive, and pooled AV may shift perceived travel times in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. The error-component mixed logit models highlight the cross-nesting between privately-owned AVs and driving. In addition, this study is the first in Canada to distinguish the VOTT reductions by AV type, trip purpose, and interior description (which caters to different tasks). VOTT reductions as large as 42% less than driving a conventional vehicle were estimated. The results of this study provide additional empirical evidence for AV VOTT reductions (particularly in the Canadian context) and can be used to help craft policies in preparation for the arrival of AVs.",0965-8564,Not found
Estimating multinomial logit models with endogenous variables: Control function versus two adapted approaches,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104068,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"It is shown that the control function (CF) method’s estimates of the modal constants in a multinomial logit model (MNL) with endogenous explanatory variables are biased. This has not previously been reported in the literature, and has consequences in demand analysis, transportation policy design and project evaluation. Two adaptations of existing approaches are proposed as alternatives to CF for deriving estimators of parameters in MNL models with endogenous explanatory variables that evidence good consistency properties. The first approach is based on moment conditions while the second one combines parameters obtained in two consecutive estimation stages. Both approaches employ instrumental variables. These two adapted approaches are implemented using simulated data from a transport mode choice problem. The results are compared with those obtained using the classic control-function method, typically used by practitioners for estimating transport demand models with endogenous variables and making quantitative evaluations of transport policies and projects. All three approaches generate similar estimates for the parameters of the explanatory variables, but the two proposed adaptations produce considerably more accurate estimates of the modal constants. This greater accuracy has potentially significant consequences for multinomial logit models’ predictive ability and estimates of marginal effects, elasticities and the social benefits of projects based on consumer surplus calculations.",0965-8564,Not found
Accounting for traffic disturbance in road infrastructure management: Optimal maintenance and rehabilitation planning for the society,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104040,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Maintaining a high level of network performance at minimal cost is a central objective for road infrastructure management. Going beyond agency costs, decisions must consider the economic and environmental impacts of maintenance and repairs strategies due to traffic delays on commuters and providers of goods and services. A dynamic programming model is presented to determine optimal management policies for current and proposed paradigms by selecting the best maintenance and rehabilitation activities at each time step over the time horizon given the concomitant and predicted states of the bridges within the network as well as predicted future origin-destination flows. The empirical analysis is demonstrated for a small network of three viaducts in an urban environment in Montréal, Canada. The incremental user costs due to interventions on the structures of the network are obtained through traffic simulations based on trip-survey data to evaluate travel delays for all possible combinations of concomitant partial or complete road closures. The results show that optimal infrastructure management strategies in space and time differ substantially depending on whether only agency costs are used, or if policies also reflect socio-economic goals (including sustainability). The main findings indicate that by including user costs in decision processes, significant reductions in user costs are achieved with minimal impact on operator costs, thus easily satisfying a cost/benefit criterion. The findings provide new evidence for policymakers that the optimal sequencing of interventions in time and space on a network can significantly reduce societal costs, sustainability objectives and environmental impacts.",0965-8564,Not found
Cruising for parking again: Measuring the ground truth and using survival analysis to reveal the determinants of the duration,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104045,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"To effectively address the challenges posed by parking searches, accurate quantification is essential. This paper introduces a novel methodology to collect unbiased ground truth GPS data on parking search behaviors. Using a mobile application, we tracked the exact starting point, chosen parking spot, and final walking destination of over 3,000 trips in Germany from 2021 to 2023. Our findings indicate a mean parking search duration of 1.5 min (in large city centers 1 min and 53 s), a figure notably lower than previous survey-based estimates. This discrepancy suggests potential biases in traditional parking search surveys, possibly stemming from negativity bias. Our research employs a competing-risks survival analysis model to investigate factors affecting parking search duration simultaneously across different categories: Free, Paid, and Illegal parking. This enables the model to examine how the driver's choice between Free, Paid, and Illegal parking interacts with and influences the parking search duration. Furthermore, our duration dependency analysis, facilitated by a time-varying baseline hazard, reveals that prolonged search duration tends to make drivers more flexible toward less optimal parking options. This inclination is particularly evident for Paid parking, indicating that as the search duration extends, drivers increasingly consider Paid parking alternatives. Typically, drivers prioritize Free parking and opt for Paid options only after unsuccessful initial searches. This behavior underscores the notion that the coexistence of Free and Paid parking in urban areas might grow parking search traffic. Additionally, our data shows that approximately 5% of journeys end in Illegal parking. In these journeys, drivers often predetermine their choice of Illegal parking, as evidenced by the significantly shorter average search duration for these cases and the result that the likelihood of Illegal parking is not affected by the previous search duration.",0965-8564,Not found
Simulation-based policy evaluation of monetary car driving disincentives in Jerusalem,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104061,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The effectiveness of congestion charges and parking prices as monetary disincentives to reduce car traffic and alleviate congestion in highly demanded urban areas is investigated, focusing on Jerusalem's diverse and congested city center. A tailored MATSim agent-based simulation model was used to examine various payment scenarios and assess the congestion level impacts of entry charges to the city center. Entry charges directly influence the number of vehicles entering the area; parking prices mostly the dwell time. Implementing a moderate daily payment of €10, either as a combined charge or separately, resulted in a substantial 25% reduction in congestion and potentially a reduction of 7.5% to 30% of emissions in the city center. Parking pricing advantages are augmented as the charged area expands. Strategic implementation of these monetary tools can effectively allow cities to manage traffic congestion, reduce pollution, and encourage a shift to sustainable transportation modes.",0965-8564,Not found
Lognormal distribution of daily travel time and a utility model for its emergence,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104058,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Understanding the nature of human movement is important in many fields, such as transportation management, urban planning, and epidemiology. In this study, we focus on travelers who are grouped by their travel modes in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Notably, for each group of travelers, the distribution of daily travel time follows a lognormal distribution. For any travel mode, the distributions of normalized travel time for different years (1968–2008) and distances to the city center converge to a curve, although the average travel time and share of travel modes vary. By employing the concept of utility, we developed a disaggregate model wherein an individual maximizes utility from traveling (=benefit - cost) by modifying daily travel time. This model theoretically explained the observed distributions of travel time. The model was further used to demonstrate travel mode choices. The model parameters were estimated using the distribution of travel time, travel mode share, and manageable assumptions. These results provided interesting interpretations of the perceptual utility of the daily travel time of a population. Moreover, the obtained curves of utility versus time are similar to the shapes of the overall benefits assumed in previous studies. Overall benefit is a concept that has been developed and examined since the 1980s, and our study provides a mathematical foundation for this idea.",0965-8564,Not found
Applying a Bayesian network for modelling the shift from motorcycle to public transport use in Vietnam,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104062,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Transport mode choice models commonly incorporate factors such as utility maximisation, socio-ecological considerations, socio-demographic characteristics, and psychological factors. However, there is still a lack of integrated models linking objective factors, such as travel mode attributes, demographic & socio-economic characteristics and built environmental characteristics, with subjective factors, such as attitudes, personal norms, and perceived behavioural control, to better understand the commuters’ modal choices. Furthermore, a clear research gap exists on mode choice behaviour in Southeast Asian countries, where motorcycling is widespread. This study aims to address these research gaps by analysing data gathered from 618 Vietnamese motorcyclists between December 2020 and February 2021. Reliability analysis and a Bayesian network are used to identify the objective and subjective factors influencing the intention to use public transport among Vietnamese motorcyclists. The findings highlight that among five subjective factors, personal norm is the most sensitive parameter in calculating the posterior probability distribution of intention and decision to use public transport along with other objective factors, namely travel time and travel cost. The results also reveal that motorcyclists aged 23 + have a higher perceived value of travel time than those aged 23–. In contrast, motorcyclists aged 23– and female motorcyclists have a higher perceived value toward environment-friendly travel modes, such as public transport. At the same time, they do not try to differentiate themselves from the societal standards in terms of motorcycle usage. The findings of this study provide valuable insights to local urban/transport planners and policymakers in Southeast Asian countries.",0965-8564,Not found
Travel behavior and system dynamics in a simple gamified automated multimodal network,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104060,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Automated Vehicles (AVs) are poised to disrupt travel patterns and the sustainability of transportation networks. Conventional methods for studying these changes, such as stated preference surveys and agent-based simulations, have limitations. Serious games offer a promising alternative, providing a controlled and engaging environment for investigating travel behavior. In our study, 200 participants, grouped into sessions of 10, engaged in a competitive serious game simulating 50 daily choices of travel mode and departure time across three automated options. Two scenarios were examined: one with recurring congestion and another with nonrecurring congestion. Automated transit had fixed schedules, while private and shared rides could adapt to a congested bottleneck. Results revealed that ridesharing dominated, reaching 60% mode share under recurring congestion, displacing transit, and a comparative equilibrium emerged between shared and private rides. In the nonrecurring congestion scenario, ridesharing dropped to 37%, and a comparable multimodal equilibrium developed. Participants rarely achieved the optimal score, attaining a maximum of 88% of its potential. This study highlights a policy paradox: unregulated AV traffic can reduce transit use, exacerbate recurring congestion, yet necessitate increased transit investment to address nonrecurring congestion, confirming the Downs-Thomson paradox. Creating appealing mass transit alternatives is imperative to ensure efficiency and sustainability in the era of automated mobility.",0965-8564,Not found
Spatio-temporal analysis on online designated driving based on empirical data,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104047,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"In recent years, mobility-on-demand services have experienced rapid growth and become an integral part of the urban transport system. As one of the prevalent mobility-on-demand services, online designated driving allows car-owners booking professional drivers via mobile apps to deliver private cars (frequently with the car-owners inside) to a designated location for a fee. Online designated driving can play a crucial role in promoting road safety by providing a responsible alternative for those who cannot drive themselves due to drinking or fatigue, but there is still a lack of empirical study on its basic travel patterns. Using massive trip records of online designated driving, this study investigates the collective and individual spatio-temporal travel patterns, and reveals the spatio-temporal impact mechanism of various land-use types on online designated driving demand. Take Beijing as a case study, the results show that unlike ride-hailing trips that primarily occur during the daytime, 93.07 % of online designated driving trips occurs between 18:00 and 7:00 the next day, with the longest peak observed on Friday nights. Meanwhile, the average distance of online designated driving trips is approximately twice as long as that of ride-hailing trips (16.58 km vs. 8.48 km). The collective travel patterns of online designated driving exhibit a shrinking trend in the form of “surface-line-point” over time. Regarding individual patterns, we rigorously demonstrate that 81.55 % of high-frequency users exhibit a “fixed-destination” phenomenon, indicating a clear centripetal tendency. Furthermore, online designated driving is primarily associated with limited land-use types, revealing that it may serve specific target audiences, like travelers returning from entertainment and catering activities after consuming alcohol, or those in need of transportation for business and automotive services. These findings can contribute to refining operational practices and enhancing regulatory measures for online designated driving.",0965-8564,Not found

Heterogeneous impacts of the high-speed railway network on urban–rural income disparity: Spatiotemporal evidence from Yangtze River Delta of China,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104050,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The socioeconomic effects of China’s fast-growing high-speed railways (HSRs) have become a popular issue in recent decades. However, few studies have examined how HSRs alleviate the urban–rural income disparity temporally and spatially; the current research addresses this gap in the literature from novel network accessibility and connectivity perspectives. Using different spatiotemporal models to analyze the Yangtze River Delta in China, the main findings are as follows: (1) there is evidence that the HSR network alleviates the urban–rural income disparity and exhibits a stronger positive impact on rural residents’ income; (2) compared with HSR accessibility, HSR connectivity affects the income disparity in a more significant manner; (3) due to its advantage in capturing the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of HSR’s impact, the geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model demonstrates a higher accuracy than other models; (4) the GTWR model results show that the HSR network affects the income disparity both negatively and insignificantly in Northern Jiangsu or Southwestern Zhejiang, while this effect is significant in other regions; and (5) further empirical evidence indicates that this varying effect is in light of differences in tertiary industry development and economic growth.

Integrated optimisation of strategic planning and service operations for urban air mobility systems,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104059,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"With the rapid development of novel vehicle technologies, electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles are becoming a new transport servicing model to achieve better urban air mobility (UAM) systems. The UAM systems can efficiently utilise low-altitude airspace resources, providing a solution to alleviate congestion in urban ground traffic. This paper delves into an integrated optimisation problem aimed at addressing decision-making processes related to the strategic planning and service operation of UAM systems, considering both demand uncertainty and spatial equity. The problem encompasses various decision components, including parking stand numbers at vertiports and vertistops, eVTOL fleet sizing as well as eVTOL fleet allocation and operations. Additionally, we introduce a spatial equity metric and establish a bi-objective optimisation model to balance the trade-off between service profitability and spatial equity considerations. We transform the bi-objective optimisation model to a tractable single-objective formulation using ε-constraint approach and linearisation technique. In this paper, we employ a scenario-based robust optimisation framework that incorporates the interval robust method to capture the demand uncertainty, enhancing resilience against uncertain factors. We evaluate the model performance using a small-scale example and further validate the proposed model through a real-world case study. Numerical analysis results demonstrate that the scenario-based robust optimisation framework can ensure the robustness of decision-making against the effect of uncertain conditions. Furthermore, numerical experiments reveal a trade-off between profitability and spatial equity, potentially requiring a partial sacrifice of profit to attain a desired equity level.

The impacts of COVID-19 on route choice with guidance information in urban rail transit of megacities,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104046,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused unprecedented decline of ridership in urban rail transit and changed passenger travel habits, which greatly challenges subway operations. Therefore, it is necessary to better understand and quantify the impact of COVID-19 on passenger travel behavior, specifically route choice. Thus, we collected automatic fare collection data and 2060 random samples through a web-based survey in Beijing on passengers’ route choice behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilizes an initial dataset to conduct an analysis and introduces an improved Generalized Random Regret Minimization model (GRRM) aimed at understanding passengers' route choice adjustments in response to COVID-19 guidance information. This improved GRRM accounts for two decision-making criteria, namely, maximum utility and minimum regret, and considers passenger heterogeneity. This marks the first instance of capturing the heterogeneity shift effect in route choice perception during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the improved model has the best fitting result with adjusted Rho square of 0.536, demonstrating that the attributes related to guidance information (i.e., information push/time to receive traffic information/perceived route COVID-19 risk) indeed enhance the model’s fit. Furthermore, the research employs Value of Information Time to quantify the preference of passengers for information in various groups. Compared with the usual scenario, women, young and non-commuter passengers are more likely to receive an early information update to plan their trips in advance. Finally, the perceived risk of COVID-19 on routes is examined in relation to passengers’ personal attributes. It is observed that the elderly and students exhibit heightened sensitivity to the epidemic at all stages, while young passengers and commuters are particularly sensitive only during the small-scale epidemic.

This study investigates the price elasticity of parking demand in the Japanese coin-parking market, which is characterized by near-free-market conditions.

The prices per 10 min were collected from 949 parking lots, and occupancy rates were observed for 133 parking lots from afternoon to evening. The estimation results, using a Heckman-type sample selection model with instrumental variables, reveal that price elasticity ranged from –1.683 to –0.9971, which is higher than the estimates of previous studies in terms of absolute value. This difference can be attributed to the characteristics of the target area where alternative parking spaces and transportation options are readily available. Our results also indicate that parking operation companies have difficulty raising price in areas with high parking density due to competition, resulting in the increase in the attractiveness of automobiles relative to public transportation.

Effects of crowding on route preferences and perceived safety of urban cyclists in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104030,183,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Bicycle use increases in many cities around the world. In the Netherlands, cycling is one of the main transport modes in cities and bicycle use is still growing. This leads to crowded cycling infrastructure in cities with high cycling shares, including in the four largest Dutch cities. Since few studies have been done to the effects of high crowding levels on cyclists’ route preferences and perceived safety, the present study aims to examine this for Dutch urban cyclists. Moreover, the relationship between perceived safety and route preferences is established. To investigate this, a questionnaire, including a route choice experiment, is completed by 1,329 cyclists from the four largest Dutch cities. The effects of varying crowding levels on route preferences and perceived safety are analysed with Mixed Logit models. Logistic regression is used to investigate the consistency between route preferences and perceived safety. The results show that crowding negatively affects route preferences as well as perceived safety, and that the impact is stronger for older cyclists and women. Furthermore, high crowding levels have a negative impact on the preference for and perception of safety of cycling infrastructure. Moreover, it is shown that all investigated route attributes have a significant effect on perceived safety, implying a more direct relationship between perceived safety and route preferences. In addition, the results show that most cyclists prefer routes they also perceive as safe. Concludingly, crowding seems an important issue for cyclists in large Dutch cities. Moreover, the perception of safety is likely to increase with the implementation of cycling infrastructure suitable for large flows of cyclists, leading to a safer cycling network for all types of cyclists.",0965-8564,Not found
Modeling impacts of freight automated vehicles in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104090,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Automated vehicle (AV) technology will bring about disruptive changes to transportation of people and goods. To better understand such changes through macroscopic modeling, studies so far predominantly focused on passenger AVs. This paper examines the impacts of freight AVs at the network level in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), Canada. This is achieved by implementing several automation scenarios in a recently developed commercial vehicle model for the GTHA. The scenarios are designed based on some of the anticipated changes in vehicle technology and the freight logistics market. They represent a range of possibilities that may occur at partial and full market adoption of freight AVs. Model results suggest that network-level congestion will increase in the near term when automated trucks operate alongside human-driven trucks and are allowed on the freeways only. However, with full market adoption, the network will be less congested compared to no automation, even if “induced” truck demand is accounted for. The overall truck vehicle kilometers travelled (VKT) will increase during partial and full truck automation.",0965-8564,Not found
Car dependency in the urban margins: The influence of perceived accessibility on mode choice,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104098,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Car dependence is a dimension of transport poverty whose subjective components have been limitedly explored. Research on car dependence highlights the incidence of transport costs, assesses the multidimensional vulnerability of car-dependency and the possibility to access valued opportunities. However, people’s perceptions and their perceived ability to access destinations may better reflect the way they move in car dependent settings. In this paper, we aim to examine what are the determinants of perceived accessibility and to which extent perceived accessibility influences mode choices in such areas. Based on a survey carried out in four peripheral and periurban municipalities in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile, we examine how subjective perceptions of accessibility contribute to explain modal choice in the outskirts. Results show that perceived accessibility has a negative net impact on the utilities for both car and public transport, which means that a low perceived accessibility increases the likelihood of choosing motorized modes. Moreover, residents from peripheral municipalities tend to perceive a higher accessibility than households from periurban areas, who are excluded from the public transport system. These findings show the importance of providing nearby opportunities and convenient alternatives to limit car dependency, especially in periurban areas.",0965-8564,Not found
Potential of demand responsive transport for young people in Sweden,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104093,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Demand responsive transport (DRT) is an intermediate form of public transport which is provided based on users’ demand. The study explores the potential of DRT for meeting young people’s travel needs, focusing on school and leisure journeys. Our results, building on a survey study in Sweden, suggest that DRT services offering a door-to-door journey and the flexibility of pick-up times could be competitive not only with intermodal transport alternative and conventional public transport modes but also with feeder modes to public transport such as cycling. DRT exhibits more potential in rural areas than urban areas, especially in areas with poor public transport service provision. To attract young people and maintain them as regular users: DRT needs to provide a high-quality service that can compete successfully with cars; system design features and measures aiming to improve safety and security for young people, particularly when traveling to leisure activities, are among the most essential attributes.",0965-8564,Not found
Uncertainties in the economic analysis of Korea's preliminary feasibility study,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104097,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Preliminary feasibility studies (PFSs) have become Korea’s unique budgetary and fiscal management system. With a critical role in decisions regarding the viability of a proposed project, a PFS prevents inefficient projects, contributing to securing a budget and thus improving fiscal efficiency. Since the introduction of PFS in 1999, until 2021, 767 corresponding studies have been conducted, and it has become an indispensable component of budgetary decision making in Korea. This study analyzes the uncertainty in forecasts of traffic, costs, and benefits in Korea’s PFS through a case study of a road PFS project. The probability distributions of the forecasts were investigated based on the historical accuracy of the PFS; as a result, the probability of the benefit being higher than the forecast in the PFS case project was only 0.195, and the probability of the cost being less than 90% of the forecast cost was only 0.256. Accordingly, the probability of the benefit–cost ratio (BCR) higher than 1.0, which was the forecasted BCR result in the PFS case project, was only 0.048. Therefore, the economic feasibility evaluation of PFS exhibits a high level of uncertainty and vulnerability. This study reveals how forecasters can use empirical measures of the accuracy of past forecasts to consider the uncertainty of traffic forecasts, costs, and benefits of their PFS projects. The uncertainty window can aid in determining whether forecast uncertainty will change a project decision or propose alternative project options that can ensure economic feasibility. This study reiterates the necessity for decision makers to be aware of the uncertainty in their transport investment decisions, and highlights the necessity of introducing a new method for evaluating economic feasibility that does not rely on a single forecast value.",0965-8564,Not found
Modelling time-of-travel preferences capturing correlations between departure times and activity durations,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104081,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Departure time choice models quantify the relative impacts of the factors affecting travellers' departure time selection and help design targeted peak-spreading policies. The departure time preference of travellers is traditionally captured using parameters associated with different alternatives along three aspects – outbound, return, and duration. In reality, departure time decisions for outbound and return legs, and the corresponding activity durations, are interrelated in most cases. However, none of the previous departure time choice models has explicitly investigated the impact of this potential correlation on model outputs. To address this gap in the existing literature, we proposed a model structure with a novel polynomial functional form of alternative specific constants (ASCs) that captures this correlation in a joint (outbound and return) departure time choice model. A revealed preference (RP) dataset from Dhaka, Bangladesh, was used to model the joint departure time preferences of the car commuters. The proposed model was then compared with a state-of-the-art model that uses a trigonometric formulation of the ASCs. Results indicate that the proposed formulation yields more behaviourally realistic outputs compared to the trigonometric model by explicitly capturing the correlation between departure time and duration. While the specific outputs are applicable to car commuters residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the framework can be applied to better predict departure times and improve the formulations of the peak spreading policies in other contexts as well.",0965-8564,Not found
Bicycle facilities and women's cycling frequency – An intersectional analysis of gendered travel behaviour,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104094,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Bicycle facilities are a widely used sustainable transportation policy tool, but their role in mitigating gendered barriers to cycling is less studied. This paper presents the findings from an online household survey conducted in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada, focusing on 10 neighbourhoods- five with a newly constructed facility and five without. In this work, we explore how socially influenced and intersectional gendered experiences (expressed through age, employment, having children and trip-chaining) may influence commute-related cycling, in the presence or absence of bicycle facilities. Results from binomial logistic regression models indicate a higher likelihood of cycling at least once a week, for commuting purpose, amongst women who are 30–44 years old, who work part-time or are students, who have children, and who engage in trip chaining during commute, in neighbourhoods with a bicycle facility. We also found that in the absence of bicycle facilities, women’s likelihood of cycling frequently was no different than men’s. Using a feminist geography lens, we argue that the presence of new bicycle facilities potentially allowed some women to minimize the barriers they experience when cycling, including social expectations around feminine performance on streets. We show the importance of intersectional analyses in cycling research. By addressing women’s traditional gender roles, opportunities and patriarchal division of labor, transportation policy can positively influence women's participation in cycling.",0965-8564,Not found
Social and spatial disparities in individuals’ mobility response time to COVID-19: A big data analysis incorporating changepoint detection and accelerated failure time models,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104089,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Although an increasing number of studies have investigated the lag time between the outbreak of COVID-19 and behavior change, few have accurately measured response times to the epidemic at the individual scale as well as their social and spatial heterogeneities. Using a large-scale, long time series dataset of individual-level mobile phone trajectories from Shenzhen, China, we compared six changepoint detection (CPD) algorithms in terms of their performance in detecting true changepoints (CPs) in time series data of individuals’ daily travel distances. We found that the kernel-based CPD method outperformed other algorithms. We thus adopted this method to calculate Shenzhen residents’ mobility response times to the outbreak of COVID-19 and further used an accelerated failure time (AFT) model to explore factors affecting response times. The results suggest that the average and median mobility response times to the outbreak in Shenzhen were 4.64 days and 4 days, respectively. Males and the elderly responded more slowly to the outbreak, while responses were faster among residents in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of highly educated, married, or employed individuals; with better regional accessibility to the city center, railway stations, or the airport; and with higher residential density. These findings can assist policymakers in determining the policy timeline and re-assessing the effectiveness and equity impact of mobility restriction policies and designing more responsive policies varying by social groups and built environment features, helping build socially-resilient neighborhoods in the post-COVID era.",0965-8564,Not found
Enforcement of the global sulphur cap: Can self-reporting provide a better solution?,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104091,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"The latest maritime sulphur regulation poses a great challenge to effective enforcement issues. This study aims to achieve greater enforceability by proposing a novel self-reporting scheme, in which truthful reporting of non-compliance from the ship operator is certainly penalized with a smaller and ex-ante fine while falsified reporting of compliance is probabilistically penalized with a larger and ex-post fine as it has to be verified by the agency through random inspection. A simultaneous compliance game model is developed for the current enforcement scheme without self-reporting while a sequential game model is dedicated to self-reporting. Mixed strategy Nash equilibriums are derived separately to characterize the interactions between the agency’s inspection strategy and ship operators’ reporting strategy as well as complying strategy. Compared with the current scheme, it is demonstrated that self-reporting can always save some inspection costs as long as the current fine is between the smaller fine and the larger fine as specified in self-reporting. The savings come from the fact that the agency does not need to inspect some non-complying ship operators who report non-compliance. Moreover, the larger fine of falsified reporting acts as a stronger deterrent so that the inspection frequency can be decreased. In terms of total environmental cost (TEC) and total compliance cost (TCC), they cannot be decreased simultaneously. However, the total compliance rate can be improved together with TEC or TCC under certain conditions. Finally, self-reporting might decrease the total system cost without increasing the (total) penalty burdens perceived by (all) individual ship operators. The associated conditions are derived separately, allowing the policymakers to fine-tune the fine levels so that self-reporting can replace the current enforcement scheme and satisfy certain policy targets with higher acceptability from the stakeholders.",0965-8564,Not found

Navigating public transport during a pandemic: Key lessons on travel behavior and social equity from two surveys in Tehran,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104075,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"This study examines the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mobility system in Tehran, Iran, and provides lessons and insights to enhance readiness for similar circumstances in the future. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in Tehran, before and towards the end of the pandemic. The study utilizes descriptive analyses and econometric modeling to investigate the frequency of use of different modes of transportation during the two periods and the changes in the willingness to use these modes due to the pandemic, in relation to sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors and pandemic-related measures. The findings indicate that public transport, and by extension collective line taxis, experienced a decline in their modal share while private car share increased particularly as passengers. Contrary to the globally observed trend, the ridership of active modes remained stable, while motorbike usage doubled during the same period. Gender and income were found to strongly influence behavior during the pandemic. Women and the elderly were less likely to use public transport, while users who continued to use public transport were primarily low-income men with little to none telecommuting options. The study recommends context-specific policy interventions including investing in ICT and active transport infrastructure, as well as promoting electric mobility, primarily for two-wheelers.",0965-8564,Not found

To examine the collaborative effects of a rail freight subsidy and carbon trading mechanism in a low-carbon transportation network, a multiobjective 0–1 mathematical model that considers transportation cost, carbon trading cost and transportation time is established in this paper, and the NSGA-II algorithm is used to solve it. The Pareto optimal frontier solution set is found for the model, and the optimal solution is determined using the evaluation function of the ideal point method. The performance and effectiveness of the NSGA-II algorithm is analyzed by means of a sample example. A case study of the Yangtze River Economic Belt region in China is conducted to demonstrate the application and practicality of the model. Sensitivity analysis is carried out on rail freight subsidy, carbon quota and carbon trading price. The numerical results highlight that the rail freight subsidy significantly contributes to the design of the low-carbon transportation network, while the low carbon trading price shows a limited effect, which also leads to a weak effect of carbon quota on low-carbon transportation network design.

Comparison of probabilistic cruising-for-parking time estimation models,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104064,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Models of parking search time predominantly rely on the binomial approximation, the calculation of which is dependent solely on the occupancy of the parking network. This paper sheds light on the importance of accounting for competition between parking searchers and the effects of dynamically changing occupancy. To this end, we investigate the accuracy of two probabilistic models, namely the binomial approximation and a model proposed by Cao and Menéndez (CaM). We utilize an agent-based microscopic parking simulation model as a benchmark for comparison purposes. Our findings highlight the significance of considering the competitive dynamics among drivers in the quest for parking spaces and the fluctuations in parking occupancy rates over short time intervals. We highlight the ranges of occupancies for which the binomial approximation and the CaM model provide more reliable estimations of parking search times. The CaM model provides, in general, more accurate estimations of search times since it accounts for various parking network characteristics such as competition and varying occupancy. The binomial approximation underestimates parking search times more substantially at high occupancies with a large number of searching vehicles, whereas the CaM model performs worse for lower spacing between parking spots and lower parking occupancies. Insights from this research are then used to discuss policy implications of accounting for competition and short-term occupancy variations when designing either parking models or parking-related control strategies.",0965-8564,Not found
Mitigating urban heat and air pollution considering green and transportation infrastructure,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104079,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Global urbanization is causing an increase in population and transportation along with a reduction of green spaces. This phenomenon is leading to the development of Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Urban Pollution Island (UPI) effects, negatively impacting the urban environment. Numerous mitigation strategies have been proposed to reduce heat and air pollution. However, the combined impact of green and transportation infrastructure and their potential to mitigate heat and air pollution remains partially understood. This review aims to contribute by systematically investigating studies on mitigation strategies for urban green and transportation infrastructure from 2003 to 2023. These strategies are classified into two types: green infrastructure-related (greenery, green roofs, and green walls) and transportation-related (transportation fuel, transportation networks, and transportation organization systems). The findings are presented under five aspects: (1) Most research on transportation infrastructure adopts qualitative research methods, whereas research on green infrastructure tends to adopt quantitative methods; (2) Developed countries prioritize upgrading their transportation fuel, while developing countries remain inclined towards developing urban green spaces; (3) In subtropical and temperate zones, green roofs and green walls may cool the local ambient (within 1 m above the surface) by up to 10℃, whereas the cooling effect in other climate zones is within 5℃; (4) More focus was put on reducing the surface temperature rather than the air temperature. Green roofs and green walls are found to cool the former 2–3 times more than the latter; (5) Green infrastructure in the subtropical zone is 1.2 to 2 times more effective at adsorbing gaseous pollutants than in the temperate zone.

Applying masked language model for transport mode choice behavior prediction,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104074,184,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Transport mode choice behavior prediction is an important link in intelligent transportation and travel services, allowing people to choose the transport mode that suits them based on different recommendations. Many existing studies often posit that individuals primarily select their modes of transportation based on criteria such as the shortest travel distance, the least amount of time required, or the lowest cost. Contrary to these common assumptions, research shows a notable discrepancy between the anticipated travel behavior based on those criteria and the actual decision-making patterns observed, emphasizing the intricacy and variety in traveler preferences. To further explore the patterns of people’s transport mode choices, this study includes an in-depth examination of how trip distance impacts mode share in five major cities. This analysis brings to light the variability in mode share changes across different spatial environments, challenging the established utility theory for the mode choice model by accentuating the personalized nature of travel preferences in diverse contexts. To make more accurate and personalized predictions, this study further delves into the application of Masked Language Models (MLMs) for analyzing individual transport mode choice behaviors. It utilizes approximately two million trip records from major Chinese cities to train the model. In contrast to traditional methodologies that transform travel data into numerical values for utility calculation, this research employs a textual data approach. Travel information is reformatted into sentences that are processed by the MLM, which then converts these sentences into word vectors for input into a supervised learning model. The results indicate that this text-based approach maintains accuracy and broadens the scope of application by harnessing rich textual data, offering a distinct advantage over traditional numerical models.",0965-8564,Not found
Improving truck stop environments to support long-haul truck driver safety and health: A scoping review,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104123,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Background Long-haul truck drivers (LHTD) are required to drive long distances to transport essential goods and products in a timely manner, which can leadto roadway safety risks, an unbalanced lifestyle, and poor health and wellbeing. While truck stops are designed for LHTD to park, refuel, eat, shower, and sleep, the lack of amenities (e.g., unavailable parking, poor food choices) contributes to poor safety and health outcomes. Objective This scoping review synthesized the evidence on the current amenities offered at truck stops and how they can be improved to support LHTD safety and health. Methods Research databases (e.g., EMBASE, Global Health, Medline) and online sources (e.g., transportation research websites) were searched for publications in English from 2006 to 2023. A total of 5,377 unique sources were identified. Two reviewers independently screened the 5,377 titles and abstracts and then the full texts of 59 sources. Three sources were included through searching reference lists of 13 full-texts included, totaling 16 sources included in the scoping review. Results Parking and basic truck stop amenities (e.g., fuel, food, restrooms, and showers) are most important to LHTD. However, there is currently a lack of available, accessible, affordable, or safe parking at truck stops which preclude LHTD from parking overnight. There is also a lack of food options to meet LHTD preferences for different cuisines, healthier choices, and options that accommodate food allergies. Moreover, LHTD expect parking, restrooms, and showers to be free when purchasing fuel. Conclusion/Implications The current state of parking and basic truck-stop amenities should be improved to prevent safety-adverse LHTD behaviors (e.g., driving beyond their hours of service and increasing their risk of driving fatigued, falling asleep, or getting into an accident). Thereis a high demand among LHTD to improve and expand the availability, accessibility, security, and cost of these truck stop amenities. Improvements to truck stop amenities may improve the resilience of supply chains and constitute public health interventions to reduce longstanding safety and health disparities.",0965-8564,Not found
User acceptance of smart e-bikes: What are the influential factors?

However, there are also concerns about crash risks and crash severity for e-bike users. Leveraging new technologies could help improve e-bike safety, amongst other safety enhancing measures, but there is little knowledge of the users’ acceptance of such technologies. This study aims to explore the user acceptance of e-bikes (pedelec with power assistance up to 25 km/h or speed-pedelec with assistance up to 45 km/h) with active road safety assistance (in short: Smart e-bikes) to improve cycling safety by adopting the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2).

A sample of 1,589 respondents, including e-bike owners and people interested in buying an e-bike, was analysed using a structural equation model (SEM). Conclusions indicate that performance expectancy, hedonic motivation and perceived safety were the strongest constructs of behavioural intention to use Smart e-bikes in the aggregated sample. All constructs vary significantly across the five countries, which can partly be explained by socio-demographic factors.

While previous studies have relied primarily on data collected from surveys to understand people’s use of transit information services, this paper uses backend data from Transit, a multimodal trip planner smartphone application (app), to analyze usage patterns in Calgary over the span of six months. A clustering analysis was initially performed to gain an understanding of trip search characteristics. The results show that most searches were made for short distanced trips. Additionally, panel data models were estimated to investigate the relationship between search frequency and transit service characteristics, temporal factors, built environment, weather and sociodemographic attributes. The model results reveal that people seek out transit information the most during times of uncertainty, as poor reliability and service disruptions were shown to increase itinerary searches markedly. Furthermore, there was found to be a significant increase in searches after the network was restructured and three bus rapid transit (BRT) lines were introduced.

Designing pedestrian zones within city center networks considering policy objective trade-offs,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104119,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"An idea key to human-centric city planning is the reclamation of urban spaces from vehicles and their redesign for human activities. Aligned with this concept, this study presents a framework for human-centric network design. The framework is developed based on a multi-objective optimization model that designs pedestrian zones within a city center network considering conflicting policy objectives. Design performance is evaluated through the interaction between the design and the behavior of network travelers. A vehicle–pedestrian multimodal network equilibrium assignment model is constructed to this end. To efficiently search for better designs, we also develop a hyper-heuristic based on the adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm that dynamically adjusts the probability of selecting operators for neighborhood search. The framework was applied to a city center network in Kawagoe City, Japan, where the conflict between vehicular and tourist pedestrian traffic has long been considered a major problem. Our algorithm successfully found a set of Pareto frontier solutions that clearly show the trade-off between conflicting objectives. A balanced network design among the frontier solutions improved pedestrian comfort by 64.7% while increasing vehicular travel time by only 3.8%. It would be ideal for municipalities to improve the pedestrian experience while maintaining current levels of convenience to drivers, but both issues must be weighed against severe road space constraints. Our approach can aid the discussion on this trade-off by providing a set of Pareto frontier solutions, as each frontier solution shows a different trade-off pattern and can be considered as a meaningful design alternative for policymakers.",0965-8564,Not found

In addition, the ordered logit model is used to verify the results of SEM and analyze the influencing factors of FSA satisfaction. Results indicate that increasing attraction levels of transport and tourism are considered to be the key determinants in improving the satisfaction with FSA, and policies and suggestions should meet tourists’ different demands.

In this study we use a longitudinal modelling technique on panel data to 1) separate within-person effects from between-person associations and 2) test whether the within-person effects changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the within-person effects were weaker during the pandemic than they were before the pandemic. In addition, the within-person effects were much smaller than would be expected based on methods that do not separate within-person effects from between-person associations.

A binary logit model to predict daily cycling was estimated, using data from the Swiss Health Survey. It is found that the frequency of physical exercise explains most of the variability of the choice to cycle or not. Since previous work in the literature has shown a clear link between exercise frequency and physical strength, one valid, although so far not directly observable hypothesis is that more physical power leads to faster speeds and higher competitiveness of cycling against other modes. The higher power output of E-Bikes and S-Pedelecs further increase cycling potentials in this context. We therefore use data from the Swiss Health Survey to impute cycling potentials for individuals who participated in the Swiss Mobility Microcensus and evaluate mode-shifts potentials to bikes based on travel times of public transport and car trips. Because our router makes use of an elevation-aware physical model, which takes into account bike and cyclist characteristics, such as input power and weight, we also model pedelecs and speed-pedelecs and show how such bike types increase the mode-shift potentials towards bicycles.",0965-8564,Not found

Building on dual-process theory, we examine the influence of affective and cognitive considerations in the formation of adoption intentions of autonomous passenger drones. Using Virtual Reality (VR), we manipulate the presence of a pilot onboard the vehicle to assess the influence of human supervision on subsequent adoption intentions using structural equation modeling. In two experimental studies, we show that affective responses exert a stronger influence on adoption intentions than cognitive considerations.

Evaluating equitable Transit-Oriented development (TOD) via the Node-Place-People model,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104116,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Transit-oriented development (TOD) has been widely practiced as a strategy to reduce automobile dependence and promote urban sustainability. However, TOD may also inadvertently induce gentrification and displacement and consequently exacerbate social inequity. This study proposes a Node-Place-People (NPP) model, extending from the classical Node-Place framework, to explicitly incorporate equity metrics into TOD analysis. The proposed NPP model is applied to assess 133 future TOD sites under the new regional transit plan, Project Connect, in the Austin, Texas area. 18 variables covering land use, socioeconomics, demographics, and multi-modal transportation connectivity are analyzed, with application of an entropy-weighted method, to generate three composite indices corresponding to NPP’s three dimensions. In the Austin application case, the People dimension measures residents’ vulnerability to the risk of potentially TOD-induced gentrification and displacement. The study then categorizes using the K-means clustering technique the 133 TOD sites into five distinct clusters—downtown, vulnerable, rural, suburban, and urban stations. Results of the analysis reveal significant imbalances along the People-Node and People-Place dimensions even in the TOD sites of relatively balanced Node-Place attributes. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating metrics representing the vulnerable people in future TOD planning to mitigate potential TOD negative impacts on disadvantaged groups, to ultimately foster equitable and sustainable TOD communities.",0965-8564,Not found
Using topic modeling to unravel the nuanced effects of built environment on bicycle-metro integrated usage,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104120,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Bicycle-metro integration, in which bicycling is used as a flexible feeder mode to connect with public transport nodes presents new opportunities for sustainable transportation. It is known that the built environment can influence travel attitudes and choice, yet the empirical evidence for the role of built environment features in shaping the bicycle-metro integration remains rare. Inspired by the idea of text mining, this article is an attempt to demonstrate a data-driven semantic framework to capture key topic-based features of land use and bicycle-metro integrated usage in the vicinity of metro stations as well as their interactions. Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling is analogously implemented here to generate a range of probability-based land use patterns and mobility patterns, and the associations between them are investigated by multivariate linear regression. A case study from Shanghai shows that the mixed land use and diversification of urban functions in the catchment areas of the metro stations can be detected effectively by 11 identified land use patterns. Based on 7 derived mobility patterns, this paper gives a probabilistic explanation to the time-varying properties of the bicycle-metro usage. All of the above thematic topics exhibit notably heterogeneous patterns in spatial distribution. The topic compositions in terms of land use pattern and mobility pattern at the station level reveal the current performance of station areas. Plus, results from the regression analysis confirm that most of the land use patterns that are related to various mixed use have close relationships with mobility patterns of bicycle-metro integration. Yet it is noteworthy that the effects of land use patterns often differ and change over time, namely affecting different mobility patterns. This study gives rise to alternative insights into the synergy between bike sharing and metro, which may help policymakers to develop more targeted TOD strategies.",0965-8564,Not found

"Introducing electric buses in urban areas: Effects on welfare, pricing, frequency, and public subsidies",10.1016/j.tra.2024.104103,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"We study optimal degree of bus system electrification for Stockholm’s longest high-frequency bus line. We evaluate the welfare effects of opportunity and depot charging fleet configurations with batteries charged during dwell times at terminal stations or during the operating pause in the bus depot, respectively. Electric buses (e-buses) significantly reduce carbon and health damaging emissions of transit services. However, e-buses are presently not welfare improving, because their lower external costs do not offset the higher supply costs (e.g., capital cost of charging infrastructures and batteries). Instead, we find that optimising bus fares and frequencies and road pricing is more effective in improving social welfare and carbon emissions. E-buses significantly reduce surplus of bus operators, which thus are reluctant to adopt these technologies without direct public support. Sensitivity analysis shows that: (i) technological developments to substantially reduce capital costs can make e-buses perform well from a social welfare perspective; (ii) efficiency gains obtained in the operation of the service, e.g., by optimizing on-board conditioning systems, but also bus routing and driving style, can have a greater impact on the cost performance of e-bus fleet configurations than simply reducing capital costs. An argument for e-buses is the efforts in coordinating a transition to electrified vehicles, aiming at reducing the risk of futile investments in charging infrastructure.",0965-8564,Not found
"Drone logistics’ resilient development: impacts of consumer choice, competition, and regulation",10.1016/j.tra.2024.104126,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Recently, drone logistics provided by many logistics service providers (LSPs) has significantly influenced consumers’ choice for last-mile delivery. Undoubtedly, drone logistics leads to more efficient deliveries and the avoidance of traffic congestion, but may incur higher operational costs and be easily impacted by government policies on drones. To figure out when should an LSP launch drone logistics and examine the impact of drone logistics on traditional logistics under airspace regulations, we develop a consumer utility model to formulate consumers’ choices, the LSPs’ profitability, and the competition dynamics between traditional and drone logistics services. We find that the introduction of drone logistics leads to intensified competition and potentially lower prices for traditional logistics. Our findings also suggest that stricter airspace regulations on drones may not deter the booming demand for drone logistics but could lead to increased service prices of traditional logistics, making the LSP’s profit increase. This study uncovers the impact and value of drone logistics, thereby helping regulators better tailor policies to manage market competition and regulate drone logistics.",0965-8564,Not found
Aggregate urban truck tour synthesis from public data,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104107,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Increasing complexity of urban freight policies demand agent-based simulation models that can address time-of-day dynamics. However, existing state of the art tools like SimMobility and MASS-GT require access to detailed establishment/shipper data. For agencies that lack such data, urban freight agent simulation requires a truck tour synthesis that can adequately fit to aggregate public data. We propose such a truck tour synthesis methodology that takes generated freight trips and distributes them onto a set of generated tours with an original balancing algorithm for entropy maximizing tour distribution that is scalable to citywide applications. The method is tested in a case study of New York City encompassing 47 industry groups, over 500 zones including gateways into the city, two truck classes, and a road network calibrated to road restrictions from New York City Department of Transportation and Uber Movement speed data across four different time periods of the day. A total of 470,000 tours were generated (10,000 tours per industry group) and flows distributed using the proposed algorithm. Compared to cross-borough screenlines, an average error in counts of 10.2% was achieved. The resulting synthetic truck population provides a baseline dataset for truck vehicle-miles-traveled, greenhouse gas emissions, and volumes across key corridors, that can be further disaggregated into truck type, industry served, and time of day. A counterfactual scenario examining a policy to require 20% smaller truck capacities highlights the applicability to quantify trade-offs with a 49% reduction in Equivalent Single Axel Loads while increasing emissions by 25%.",0965-8564,Not found
Closing the loophole of vehicle ownership restriction: The impact of non-local vehicle restriction on new vehicle registrations and air pollution,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104102,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Vehicle ownership restriction (VOR) is considered effective in reducing traffic congestion and air pollution. However, citizens manage to circumvent VOR by registering vehicles from other cities, undermining the effectiveness of VOR. To close the loophole, some cities introduced a non-local vehicle restriction (NLVR) policy with an announcement period prior to the official enforcement of NLVR. By taking Beijing, China as a case study, this paper quantifies the effectiveness of NLVR in patching VOR and explores citizens’ adaptive behavioral response during the announcement period. A propensity score matching with difference-in-differences (DID) method is first adopted to quantify the new vehicle registrations in neighboring cities of Beijing. Then, a regression control method based on Lasso and a DID approach are used to isolate the causal effect of NLVR on air pollution. Finally, we investigate the announcement effect of NLVR on new vehicle registrations and air pollution, respectively. Our results suggest that NLVR has its intended effect of closing the loophole in Beijing’s previously-enacted VOR. Average monthly new vehicle registrations in neighboring cities of Beijing drops by 3.4% and NO 2 concentration in Beijing decreases by 5.59 μ g / m 3 . During the announcement period, we observe a significant decrease in new vehicle registrations in neighboring cities, suggesting that potential buyers have refrained from purchasing new vehicles in anticipation of the forthcoming stringent NLVR. However, there is no notable decline observed in NO 2 concentration in Beijing. We recommend that policymakers should fully analyze the relationship between participants, foster regional cooperation on transport policies, and design a reasonable announcement period according to the policy’s purposes.",0965-8564,Not found
Disconnecting a city centre to prevent through traffic: An a priori evaluation with a focus on freight transport,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104125,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"There has been a growing interest from public authorities around the world in implementing measures aimed at preventing through traffic in city centres and establishing car-free zones. One of these initiatives has recently been proposed by the City of Bergen, aiming to zone the city centre in such a way that, in the long run, only public transport and emergency vehicles can pass through. While the zoning is primarily focused on mobility to make the city centre more attractive to residents by reducing traffic and parking, its effects on freight delivery in relation to city liveability is not thoroughly discussed. This paper investigates the implications of this zoning decision on freight transport, offering authorities a broader understanding of its impact through the utilization of clustering and routing models of freight carriers at a holistic level. Our analysis reveals that alongside the anticipated increase in total driving for freight deliveries throughout the city, there would also be a rise in traffic within the city centre itself, which may not have been intended or expected. As a remedy, we analyse the effect of introducing a micro-hub for consolidation, and bicycles for the last mile delivery, another policy that is presently being considered by the city. Our study highlights the importance of integrating freight transport into decision-making processes from the initial stages, rather than treating it as a secondary concern relative to mobility.",0965-8564,Not found
The effect of changing registration taxes on electric vehicle adoption in Denmark,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104117,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Large-scale deployment of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is strategically important for the transition toward a low-carbon economy. Denmark has traditionally stimulated BEV diffusion through a registration tax exemption that was lifted in 2016 and partially reintroduced in 2018. Exploiting car registration and detailed population data covering the period 2013–2019 and using Bayesian additive regression trees, this paper provides new evidence on (i) the effects of the changes in the registration tax on the adoption of BEVs in Denmark, (ii) the socioeconomic factors that influence BEV adoption, and (iii) the presence of freerider effects. The results suggest that the number of BEVs would have been higher had the tax exemption remained. Moreover, we detect heterogenous treatment effects that are larger the more likely a socioeconomic group is to purchase a BEV. Consequently, we expect that there are substantial freerider effects in the promotion of BEVs via the tax system.",0965-8564,Not found
Airline and high-speed rail collaboration and competition under travel time variability,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104104,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"With the expansion of high-speed rail (HSR) service in many countries, competition between HSR and regional air transport has become increasingly fierce. However, HSR can also serve as a collaborator to connect passengers from hubs to smaller cities, potentially benefiting both modes of transportation. This paper presents a stochastic equilibrium model of transportation mode choices for intercity travelers, considering both flight and HSR options under travel time variability and the possibility of missing flights. HSR is assumed to provide fixed travel time and high-frequency service, while airlines’ flight times and security delays are subject to variability expressed as probability distributions. In addition, the study proposes an optimization model for operators to determine the optimal route frequency and itinerary fare, and investigates the fare equilibrium condition under competition, with or without modal collaboration. In the numerical exercises, the impact of introducing HSR and its service frequency on airline ridership, as well as the effect of customs control time variance and flight time variance on pricing, are investigated. The findings reveal the potential impacts of HSR on airline ridership, and suggest the importance of considering differences in travel time and security delay variabilities between HSR and airlines. Furthermore, the frequency optimization result shows the benefit of collaboration between airline and HSR, where hub-to-hub routes are emphasized and some passengers are split to transfer to HSR.",0965-8564,Not found
Low emission zones and traffic congestion: Evidence from Madrid Central,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104099,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"The aim of this paper is to shed light on the effect of Low Emission Zones (LEZs) on traffic. LEZs are areas in which access is restricted for the most polluting vehicles. They have been found to be effective in reducing pollution, while the expected effect on traffic is not clear. Using high-frequency granular data on traffic for the city of Madrid, I analyze whether LEZ schemes are effective in reducing flow and density within the area of implementation and whether they generate a displacement effect. Taking advantage of the exogeneity of the implementation timing, I develop a pre/post analysis based on time. Results suggest a reduction in traffic inside the restricted area and a displacement to all the other areas of the city. I find a switch to public transport for commutes directed towards the restricted area and rerouting of trips for destinations outside Madrid Central to be two of the possible mechanisms explaining these results. The reduction in traffic inside the restricted area gradually decreases over time and disappears after 7 months. This is consistent with the renewal of the vehicles’ fleet with unrestricted and cleaner vehicles generated by the policy.",0965-8564,Not found

Public transport services are crucial for meeting this demand, especially for students, who form the most abundant group and are typically captive users of this mode. However, various factors including infrastructure, operation, safety, and environment influence the perception of public transport users regarding their daily trips. Therefore, this case study of a Brazilian university examines the relationships among these factors, using a structural equation modeling approach with multiple indicators and multiple causes (SEM-MIMIC), based on perception data from public transport users within the academic community. The results indicate the importance of incorporating safety perception into travel satisfaction models and considering the interaction between infrastructure and public transport operation attributes. It is also crucial to account for the attributes of the environment in which university students travel. Furthermore, the findings show that user perceptions are influenced by factors such as gender, vehicle availability, total travel time, and the adequacy of the service to cope with specific needs. Based on these findings, urban mobility and university managers can plan measures to effectively enhance the attractiveness of public transport and encourage its usage among members of the academic community.",0965-8564,Not found
Low emission zone and mobility behavior: Ex-ante evaluation of vehicle pollutant emissions,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104101,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Exposure of the population living in urban areas to an increasing level of air pollution has led local authorities to implement vehicle access restrictions to limit the circulation of pollutant vehicles and foster sustainable travel habits. With these aims, Low Emission Zones (LEZs) have been introduced in several European cities. Many previous works have evaluated the impacts of such regulation; however, they adopted pre-defined assumptions about new travels to access the regulated area and neglected potential behavioral changes induced by the measure. The aim of this paper is to quantify the effects of a LEZ on vehicle pollutant emissions, considering potential short-term variations of travel habits after its introduction (i.e., vehicle replacement, modal shift and destination change), and the associated uncertainty. The study area was the Municipality of Padova (Italy), where a LEZ is likely to be enforced. A holistic evaluation framework was applied combining a behavioral model and a traffic simulation model, calibrated using responses from a mobility survey administered to local stakeholders and traffic counts. The results highlighted the measure could contribute to induce fleet renewal and modal shift toward sustainable transportation means, that could be furtherly fostered by increasing the awareness of the benefits of the LEZ. Furthermore, the outcomes confirmed that the intervention could significantly reduce vehicle pollutant emissions within the area. Nevertheless, a spillover effect could occur outside the LEZ, due to the long detours that travelers deciding to avoid entering the zone have to perform.",0965-8564,Not found
Energy and environmental costs in transitioning to zero and low emission trucks for the Australian truck Fleet: An industry perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104108,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Modernising Australia’s old truck fleet and adopting a more stringent standard to reduce emissions and air pollutants is a primary objective for the Australian truck sector. Various strategies worldwide have been introduced to cut emissions and pollutants in the truck sector, such as a low-emission strategy supported by strict diesel standards and a zero-emission strategy to shift to battery-electric or hydrogen trucks. The paper focuses on emissions and local air pollutants of trucks under various transition scenarios at both the tailpipe and the wider supply chain including domestic power generation and hydrogen production. In contrast, for diesel, we focus on tailpipe outputs following fuel standards in Australia, given diesel is imported other than in some limited refineries. We compare and recommend actions that government and truck operators may take in the near to longer term in transitioning to cleaner energy. We tested a number of scenarios using a decision support system incorporating all the latest information on costs and emissions for all truck classes using diesel, electric or hydrogen. A key finding from our scenario tests is that the current electricity mix has high carbon emissions and air pollutants due to fossil fuel-fired sources for power generation. Without improvement in using renewable energy sources in the future, transitioning to electric trucks implies more carbon emissions and air pollutants in the atmosphere from power plants, even though electric trucks generate zero tailpipe emissions. The main motivation for switching to zero-emission trucks is energy cost savings. We urge the government to decide on a clear roadmap for the truck sector before the sector is in a position to take action to shift to low or zero-emission trucks without totally relying on the likely reduction of emission intensity in electricity and renewable energy production.",0965-8564,Not found
Car-fuel poverty: Determinants and policy implications for France,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104095,185,2024-07-01,2024,7,"In the face of inflation following the Ukrainian crisis, several European governments implemented a generalized gasoline subsidy. In contrast, the reduction of fossil-fuel consumption is crucial to mitigate the current energy and climate crises. Fuel consumption for transport increases with income, making rich households the main beneficiaries of generalized subsidies. In this context, a thorough investigation of the nature of vulnerability to rising gasoline prices is needed to formulate targeted policies. Herein, we contribute in this line for the case of France. Firstly, we develop three metrics of car-fuel poverty. Secondly, we use multivariate statistic analysis to identify car-fuel-poor household profiles. Then, we estimate the socioeconomic determinants of such vulnerability. We find that, aside from income, household composition, region, access to public transport, and house ownership significantly impact the probability of being car-fuel-poor. Then, using our results, we evaluate the impact of recent subsidies implemented in France and suggest alternative targeted policies. We find that the policies that have been implemented are regressive and incur in inclusion and exclusion errors. Instead, a targeted subsidy fully compensating the car-fuel-poor would have been efficient implying, at the same time, important government savings.",0965-8564,Not found

PC operates on the border of a protected region of a traffic network. Most studies thus far considered fixed-time plans for the inner part of these regions. A few studies have shown that combining PC with locally actuated or decentralized traffic control systems may have positive effects on traffic performance, including better-defined Network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (NMFDs), increased network throughput, and reduced delays. The Traffic-responsive Urban Control (TUC) is a real-time network-wide traffic control system with particular design characteristics, such as the balancing of link’s occupancies and an inherent gating feature. These characteristics suggest that TUC may enhance the traffic network performance when combined with PC whilst improving the resulting NMFDs and network throughput and delays. In this work, we investigate the effect of feedback perimeter control (FPC), TUC, and their combination on the NMFD and on the traffic conditions of general traffic and public transport in the microsimulation of a realistic model of the Christchurch Central Business District in New Zealand. We perform a thorough investigation of practical aspects of both control strategies and their combination, including parameter tuning and infrastructure requirements, and how they may affect the control system choice. Results show higher throughput and less hysteresis on the NMFDs, particularly when TUC is involved. PC provides benefits concentrated in the protected region which can greatly benefit public transportation if there is an overlap with the transit network.

Are public transit investments based on accurate forecasts? An analysis of the improving trend of transit ridership forecasts in the United States,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104142,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Historically, forecasts of travel demand on public transit infrastructures have been found to be optimistically biased. However, there has been a lack of data available for statistically significant analysis of factors affecting the accuracy. This paper analyzes the overall trend of transit ridership forecast accuracy in the US and contextualizes it with ridership trends based on the largest yet database of 164 large-scale transit infrastructure projects in the US. We find that transit ridership is about 24.6 % lower than forecast on average with about 70 % of the projects over-predicting ridership. Forecast accuracy varies by mode, service area characteristics, familiarity with transit, ramp up period, and time span. The accuracy has been getting better over the years, particularly after 2000 with the introduction of new analytical and evaluation tools as part of the Capital Investment Grants program. Projects that have been forecasted since 2000 have average ridership about 22 % lower than forecast, compared to about 52 % lower from pre-2000. The steadily improving accuracy, however, is offset by the unexpected decline in transit ridership since 2012. Advent of ride-hailing services and improved socio-economic trends that support auto-oriented cities have prompted this decline in ridership and have affected their forecasts as well. Despite the improving trend, we find that there remains substantial deviation in the outcomes from their forecasts. This points to the need of better scrutiny of model inputs and specifications and how they interact with the built environment to unearth the underlying reasons for inaccuracy. Planners and policymakers may make use of our results to advocate for considering the uncertainty around forecasts for any project and funding decision.",0965-8564,Not found
Acceptance and demand of autonomous vehicles for long-distance recreational travel: An investigation based on a survey of visitors to US national parks,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104157,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The study of anticipated changes in travel behavior that could be brought by autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been widespread for commuting and short-distance daily travel, yet little attention has been given to long-distance travel. To address this research gap, this paper presents an analytical model for estimating public preference towards the adoption and use (in terms of frequency and length of trips) of AVs, focusing on long-distance recreational travel (LDRT). The model considers socio-demographics, trip-specific characteristics, in-vehicle time use-related factors, and attitudinal latent variables (AV usefulness, AV concern, driving enjoyment) as potential influencers of AV acceptance and demand. To analyze the proposed model, data were collected from a survey of visitors to US national parks conducted in Summer 2022, and the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was employed. The results indicate that the frequency and length of long-distance recreational trips will likely be higher in the AV era. This draws attention to tourism destination managers not only to manage the tourists’ demand at destinations but also to manage traffic on the roads leading to the destinations. Additionally, the results show that the LDRT demand will continue to rise with the increase in AV acceptance due to the usefulness and potential for several in-vehicle activities offered by vehicle automation, despite concerns about system safety, data privacy, and legal liability. The study also reveals that some travelers will likely miss manual driving enjoyment in AV driving, particularly in unique travel settings like tourism travel, and thus might opt for manual driving options. Based on these findings, we advocate for the timely consideration of induced LDRT, and tourism travel demand generated by AVs—such as provisioning sustainable public transport options to recreational and tourism destinations.",0965-8564,Not found

We find that URT development is strongly and negatively correlated with auto ownership in both countries, after controlling for standard social-economic and natural/built environment variables. Importantly, the impact transpires only after a URT system reaches a tipping point that sets in motion a network effect. We also uncover strong evidence of cannibalization by URT of bus market share in both countries. However, rather than undermining the supply of bus services, developing URT is strongly and positively correlated with its growth and adaptation. Finally, no de-congestion benefit of URT is detected in the data.

Disentangling the resiliency of international transportation systems under uncertainty by a novel multi-layer spherical fuzzy decision-making framework: Evidence from an emerging economy,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104151,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Although transportation systems play a critical role in the global socio-economic facets, they are acknowledged as vulnerable systems directly impacted by unexpected events, e.g., natural calamities, war, traffic accidents, terrorist attacks, and public health. In this respect, improving the resiliency of transportation systems under uncertainty is a controversial global challenge that this study could underpin. To do so, a systematic literature review (SLR) extracted a list of resiliency factors for resilient transportation systems. Next, a novel version of spherical fuzzy Delphi (SFD) screened factors, considering the case of Iran’s international maritime transportation system. Moreover, the causal network relationship of the finalised factors was analysed by a novel hybrid spherical fuzzy approach, including a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and the analytic network process (ANP). Later, the unexpected events that occurred after 2000 were investigated. The SLR deeply investigated 51 of the top relevant articles. As a result, 12 factors and 22 subfactors that affect transportation systems resiliency were extracted. Notably, the rest of the findings primarily apply to the Iranian context. By implementing the SFD, ten factors were screened for Iran’s international maritime transportation system and then analysed by SF-DEMATEL. After, the analysed factors were weighted by SFANP, where “recoverability” was selected as the most critical factor, and the “technological and communicational” factor was chosen as the least critical factor.

How to optimize train lines for diverse passenger demands: A line planning approach providing matched train services for each O-D market,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104154,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Line planning decides critical service contents of a passenger railway schedule. In real-world scenarios, passengers’ travel expectations or preferences on service qualities tend to be heterogeneous among different origin–destination (O-D) pairs or even in the same O-D pair, which requires railway operators to schedule train services catering to those diverse passenger demands. However, previous line planning approaches either treated passengers homogeneously or roughly divided simple passenger groups by travel purposes or service types. In this paper, we view each passenger O-D pair as an individual O-D market and propose a line planning approach where concluded train lines can deliver matched service levels of trains for each O-D market. Based on the Set Covering Problem (SCP), we establish a novel bi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that considers the benefits of both railway operators and passengers. Multiple service qualities for each passenger O-D pair, such as travel speed, direct or transfer connection, frequency, price, etc. are seen as the objects to be “covered” by train lines, to achieve a more accurate supply–demand match. Facing the potential conflicts between diverse passenger demands and limited railway supply, we formulate a series of non-rigid constraints (NRC) to achieve a non-rigid supply–demand match i.e., each O-D pair’s demands can be either guaranteed to be satisfied or satisfied as much as possible. In this manner, railway operators can testify different marketing policies and make marketing decisions regarding which O-D markets should improve, maintain, or degrade services. A heuristic rule-based adaptive iterative searching approach (ISA) is designed to solve large-scale model structures. We take the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway (HSR) line as the case study background. We comparatively evaluate the operation and service performances of multiple cyclic line plan scenarios, discuss the performance difference, and state our policy implication. We also recalibrate the service levels of the real-world non-cyclic line plan. The experiment results show that our proposed approach can efficiently help design the line plans based on customized marketing policies and improve the service levels of the real-world line plan.",0965-8564,Not found
Tradable mobility credits for long-distance travel in Europe,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104156,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"There is an urgent need to devise policy instruments that will reduce GHG emissions to a sufficient extent in order to achieve the climate targets. Approximately 16% of all greenhouse gas emissions are generated by long-distance travel. Our objective is to estimate the impact of a Tradeable Mobility Credit (TMC) scheme − where the total emissions are fixed by design whereas the price is the outcome of travelers’ choices − will have on modal split and trip cancellation for long-distance leisure travel in Europe. To this end, we develop a market equilibrium model which accounts for travel and trading decisions. For our case study consisting of a travel demand of more than 300 million trips performed annually between 3,000 city-pair connections, the credit price that emerges in the market equilibrium state is 272€ per ton of CO2 under an emission reduction target of 30%. Due to the TMC, overall long-distance leisure travel demand is reduced by 20% and the share of air among the remaining trips decreases from 50 to 42% whereas the market share of rail increases from 23 to 26%. Modal shifts and trip cancellation rates vary greatly amongst OD-pair connections, depending on the local value-of-time and the extent of modal competition for the respective connection. Our findings contribute to the on-going debate surrounding instruments for stimulating sustainable (im)mobility, in particular in the context of the long-distance travel market.",0965-8564,Not found
"Characterizing last-mile freight transportation using mobile phone data: The case of Santiago, Chile",10.1016/j.tra.2024.104149,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Understanding the mobility of surface freight transportation is relevant in urban planning and for developing public policies. Literature shows that most previous efforts on this topic rely on surveys and limited data. In contrast to other works, in this paper, we present an innovative methodology for characterizing last-mile freight transportation that uses a novel and copious data source: mobile phone data, which provides a broader scope. Our methodology involves calibrating supervised machine-learning models that allow us to link cell phones with truck drivers. In this endeavor, we construct several input variables that track mobile phone’s daily movement patterns, including traveled distances, interactions with highway networks, and land use variables. We test our approach by conducting a case study in Santiago, Chile, for which we analyze mobility patterns and logistics indicators disaggregated by day, hour, and zoning. For this case, we show that all supervised models performed well regarding AUC, which can be attributed to the high granularity and handling of the data. However, we chose to use NGBoost in all subsequent experiments, as it provided slightly better results on our validation data. Our work has several implications for practice. For instance, our results can support decision-makers and policymakers in identifying critical areas where urban logistics centers and transportation interventions are needed. Finally, several research lines stem from our work, which include assessing the impact of incorporating geospatial information and the measurement of logistics sprawl over time.",0965-8564,Not found
Identifying teleworking-related motives and comparing telework frequency expectations in the post-pandemic world: A latent class choice modeling approach,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104070,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, teleworking is still widely adopted even though it is no longer a mandatory work arrangement. It is important to understand the motives of those who continue to telework, as diverse motives may be associated with heterogeneous travel patterns. In this study, we apply a latent class choice model to a 2021 sample of current and expected future teleworkers, and identify five latent segments based on their dominant telework-related motives, namely travel-dominant (comprising 25% of the weighted sample), flexibility-dominant (24%), career-dominant (22%), workplace-discouraged (20%), and family-dominant (9%). Specifically, travel-dominant, workplace-discouraged, and family-dominant teleworkers may use teleworking to solve particular issues, while flexibility-dominant teleworkers may simply be drawn to some of the assorted merits of teleworking (perhaps even to its “option value”). Career-dominant teleworkers tend to treat teleworking as an occasional work arrangement. We also generate detailed segment-specific profiles to better understand each type of teleworker. The segment-specific outcome models explore factors that influence the expected post-COVID teleworking frequency. We find that factors such as gender, education, and job characteristics have heterogeneous impacts on teleworkers with different dominant motives. Interestingly, results suggest gendered family-support roles even among teleworkers with apparently similarly family-oriented motivations. Overall, this study provides useful insights based on classifying teleworkers by different telework-related motives and exploring the heterogeneous impacts of other variables on teleworking frequency. The results will lay a foundation for future studies to explore teleworking impacts on post-COVID travel behavior changes.",0965-8564,Not found
Examining the treatment effect of teleworking on vehicle-miles driven: Applying an ordered probit selection model and incorporating the role of travel stress,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104072,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Teleworking gained considerable popularity during the pandemic, and understanding its impact on travel behavior is of critical interest for post-pandemic transportation planning given its high relevance to travel demand and related issues. We utilize ordered probit endogenous switching regression models to analyze 2021 data from two metropolitan regions, Dallas-Ft. Worth, TX and Washington, DC, consisting of a total of 1,584 observations. We identify factors that impact the adoption and frequency of teleworking (TWing), as well as the weekly vehicle-miles driven (VMD), while accounting for self-selection biases. We define three TW categories: non-TWing (NTW), non-usual TWing (NUTW, fewer than 3 days a week), and usual TWing (UTW, 3+ days a week). We further separate workers based on teleworking-related motives (specifically, travel-stressed or not) to compare results when the outcome variable (VMD) is likely congruent with the teleworking motivation versus when it is not. Based on the model results, we quantify and compare the impacts (i.e. the “treatment effects”) of teleworking on VMD. We find that the treatment effects on the treated – i.e. the effects on NUTWers of adopting NUTWing, and the effects on UTWers of adopting UTWing – constitute significant reductions in VMD, on average, for both travel-stressed and non-travel-stressed TWers. For travel-stressed NTWers, we find that adopting NUTW teleworking at a low frequency level (i.e., less than 3 times a week) would not significantly reduce VMD, while for non-travel-stressed UTWers, adopting NUTW would significantly increase VMD, on average. However, adopting UTWing or increasing teleworking frequency from non-usual to usual always leads to a reduction in VMD on average, whether travel-stressed or non-travel-stressed. The ordered probit endogenous switching regression methodology used here, including visualizations of factual and counterfactual effects and back-transformation of the log-transformed outcome variable, can also be applied to numerous other research topics.",0965-8564,Not found
Evaluating congestion pricing schemes using agent-based passenger and freight microsimulation,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104118,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"The distributional impacts of congestion pricing have been widely discussed in the literature and the evidence on this is mixed. Some studies find that pricing is regressive whereas others suggest that it can be progressive or neutral depending on the specific spatial characteristics of the urban region, existing activity and travel patterns, and the design of the pricing scheme. Moreover, the welfare and distributional impacts of pricing have largely been studied in the context of passenger travel whereas freight has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we examine the impacts of several congestion pricing schemes on both passenger transport and freight in an integrated manner using a large-scale microsimulator (SimMobility) that explicitly simulates the behavioral decisions of the entire population of individuals and business establishments, dynamic multimodal network performance, and their interactions. Through simulations of a prototypical North American city, we find that a distance-based pricing scheme yields larger welfare gains than an area-based scheme, although the gains are a modest fraction of toll revenues (around 30%). In the absence of revenue recycling or redistribution, distance-based and cordon-based schemes are found to be particularly regressive. On average, lower income individuals lose as a result of the scheme, whereas higher income individuals gain. A similar trend is observed in the context of shippers — small establishments having lower shipment values lose on average whereas larger establishments with higher shipment values gain. We perform a detailed spatial analysis of distributional outcomes, and examine the impacts on network performance, activity generation, mode and departure time choices, and logistics operations.",0965-8564,Not found
Correlates of perceived accessibility across transport modes and trip purposes: Insights from a Swedish survey,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104147,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Accessibility frequently serves as a central objective in policy and planning due to its significance for travel behavior, health, and economic development. However, until recently, there has been limited attention given to how individuals perceive their accessibility, and even less focus on how these perceptions differ across various transportation modes and trip purposes. This study explores how sociodemographic traits, accessibility indicators, as well as transport resources, attitudes, and habits correlate with perceived accessibility. We assess whether these correlations differ based on transport mode (bicycle, car, public transport, walking) and trip purpose (commuting, grocery shopping, dining out, reaching the city center). Based in the Gothenburg Region, Sweden, this study uses web-panel survey data to capture perceived accessibility. Sixteen ordinal regression models were applied, each tailored to a specific transport mode-activity combination. The results highlight the importance of all categories of correlates in shaping perceived accessibility. Specifically, transport resources, habits, and attitudes exhibit the strongest correlations. Notably, car access, positive car-related attitudes, and frequent car usage are linked to lower perceived accessibility for walking, cycling, and public transport but higher perceived car accessibility. Future studies should consider disaggregating their analyses based on travel mode, as significant disparities exist, particularly between perceived accessibility by car and alternative modes.",0965-8564,Not found
TOD typology and station area vibrancy: An interpretable machine learning approach,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104150,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Transit-oriented development (TOD) has great potential to foster vibrant communities through improved access to activities around station areas. Several studies have investigated station area vibrancy and associations with TOD built environment (BE). However, few have considered the nonlinear impacts and varying relationships across station types. Taking Nanjing, China as a case study, we aim to 1) identify types of metro station areas (MSAs) with a “node-place-functionality” model and 2) unravel the nonlinear BE-vibrancy relationships and variations across MSA types. We find that five types best characterize the TOD built environment and present different levels of vibrancy indicated by the Baidu Heat Index. The GBDT (gradient boosting decision tree) models reveal transit accessibility, intersection density and commercial service density as the top three predictors of daytime and nighttime vibrancy, all presenting nonlinear and threshold effects. We also find the predicting power of BE features differs significantly across MSA types. The nuanced analyses provide context-specific planning guidance.",0965-8564,Not found

The estimated cross-elasticity is positive and significant for utilitarian traffic, and increased in 2022 when prices became more salient. To derive our results, we exploit fuel-price variations caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, among other factors. Cross-elasticities are then estimated by running both OLS and IV regression models on hourly bicycle counts from 72 automated counting stations. While cross-elasticities have been estimated for low-cycling countries such as the U.S. or Australia, our results provide valuable insights for transport planning and sustainable policy making in higher-cycling countries.",0965-8564,Not found
Resilience analysis of the integrated China-Europe freight transportation network under heterogeneous demands,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104130,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"In recent years, there have been recurrent disruptions in global freight transportation shipping, prompting a focus on the need for increased resilience in the freight transportation network. Against this backdrop, the China-Europe Railway Express, an emerging alternative to shipping, has gained improvement. In light of these developments, an assessment of the resilience of the integrated China-Europe Freight Transportation Network (CEFTN) under disruptive influences has become crucial. In response to this necessity, this paper puts forward a generalized cost-based assessment system considering heterogeneous freight demands for evaluating the resilience of the CEFTN. In the case study, we not only conduct a series of sensitivity analyses to discover the impact of proportion of heterogeneous demands, freight charges, and duration time of disruptions on the system resilience, but also give a variety of detailed resilience analyses under different disrupted scenarios including system failures, natural disasters, geopolitical impact, and deliberate attacks. Through our analysis, we find that an increase in freight charges during disruptions could potentially improve the CEFTN resilience due to the effect of high time-value freight demands replacing low time-value freight demands. Moreover, strategies such as adjusting the freight flow, safeguarding critical links, and implementing different measures in different nodes are identified as additional measures to improve the resilience of the CEFTN.",0965-8564,Not found
Understanding factors influencing user engagement in incentive-based travel demand management program,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104145,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Incentive-based travel demand management (IBTDM) has proven effective in mitigating traffic congestion. However, a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing user engagement in IBTDM is lacking due to limited empirical evidence from real-world applications. This study bridges this research gap by examining data from over 4,000 users in an actual IBTDM program, incenTrip, in the Washington, D.C.-Baltimore region. Employing Poisson-Tweedie generalized additive models to account for excess zeros and nonlinear relations, the study examines how home and work-related factors influence users’ enrollment and engagement, measured by the number of registrations, generated trips, and earned incentives at a census block group level. Results reveal that: 1) Urban areas with high population densities and low incomes attract more users and encourage more green travel. 2) Initial enrollment is higher among young, female, Asian, and highly-educated residents, although their subsequent engagement may not be sustained. 3) Workers in educational institutions and retail trades exhibit higher enrollment and maintain stronger engagement than other workers. 4) Well-developed transportation facilities and a higher density of points of interest near the users’ homes or workplaces substantially enhance program attractiveness. 5) Nonlinearities, particularly threshold effects, are observed across various relations analyzed. These findings have valuable policy implications for optimizing ongoing IBTDM programs and informing future initiatives. Policy recommendations include implementing targeted and progressive incentives, adopting combined TDM strategies, prioritizing user-friendly designs, fostering collaboration with employers, and employing nuanced policymaking.",0965-8564,Not found
Microeconomic analysis of ridesourcing market regulation policies,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104128,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"We develop a microeconomic model of competition between ridesourcing, public transport, and cruising taxis to analyse how alternative ridesourcing regulation policies affect not only the ridesourcing service but also other modes of transport. To maximise social welfare in a framework with congestion externalities, we analyse three alternative regulation policies (i) a charge as a percentage of the ridesourcing trip fare (ii) a fixed charge per ridesourcing trip, and (iii) a fixed charge per ridesourcing vehicle. A randomised search algorithm is programmed and simulations are performed considering the base case of the Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile. We find that for the case of speeds below 9 km/h, the market power of the platform is dominated by the congestion externality effect, which leads to an optimum where the regulator charges a tax to the platform. In turn, waiting time for ridesourcing increases, but congestion decreases. Lower congestion scenarios lead to a ridesourcing subsidy, in which the regulation policy increases the number of ridesourcing drivers and reduces waiting time, at the cost of increasing congestion. For a given scenario (either low-congestion or high-congestion), we find that the profits of the agents involved (ridesourcing platform and drivers, taxi drivers, and bus operator) are sensitive to the type of regulation applied, however the total social benefit and consumer surplus are largely insensitive to the regulation adopted, therefore policymakers could take into account, for instance, the effects on the financial situation of the public transport sector when deciding which type of regulation instrument to apply to the ridesourcing sector.",0965-8564,Not found

A participatory mapping approach to capturing perceived walkability,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104133,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"We present a novel method for capturing citizens’ views on perceived walkability. Peoples’ decisions to use any transport mode are determined by perceived accessibility, thus perceived walkability is vital to the decision to walk for transport. To date, approaches to understanding perceived walkability, such as detailed ‘walkability audit’ instruments, have been difficult to scale and linked only to respondents’ residential locations. In contrast our research uses an online mapping tool designed to rapidly capture vague knowledge about places. Respondents use a map interface to spray-paint the most and least walkable areas across the city of Sydney, Australia, along with defining the area they regularly walk from home and where they would be willing to walk. They also provide free-text input to explain their responses. This approach enables data collection of respondents’ holistic understanding of the walkability of different areas based on the local knowledge and experience of the city. Pilot results together with qualitative analysis of text submitted in response to open ended questions are presented to demonstrate the feasibility, face validity and potential of the method. A comparison with an accessibility-based walkability index, WalkTHERE, for Sydney is shown. Results are broadly aligned, but the perceived walkability results presented highlight the negative environmental quality of walking near high-traffic roads and the positive aspects of natural and water views, which are not captured in this walkability index. Perceived walkable areas around the home were on average similar in overall area to the common standard of 15-minute buffers, but longer in their longest dimension, and have irregular shapes. Detailed methodology for analysis of the online mapping inputs is provided. This method has potential for rapid yet rich data collection, particularly when used together with a walkability model to understand differences which can point to localised problems with walking environment quality.",0965-8564,Not found
Who are the early adopters of alternative fuel technology? A study of Swedish road freight companies,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104132,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"This study investigates the effect of three key firm characteristics (diversification, size, and age) on road freight companies’ early adoption of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). While previous studies have identified the determinants of the adoption intention of AFVs, a gap in the literature is research into firm characteristics and the early adopters of AFVs. Because early adopters play an important role in the diffusion of innovation, it is imperative to fill this gap. Based on a survey of 156 Swedish road freight companies and logistic regression analyses, we report that firm size and diversification affect the early adoption of AFVs. In addition, the partial impact of the importance of driver comfort and payload capacity on early adoption of AFVs has been reported. Other factors, including purchase price, fuel cost, and truck refueling efficiency, were not found to discriminate early adopters of AFVs from those who had not yet adopted AFVs. These findings imply to policymakers that the current instruments in use in Sweden, including the greenhouse gas mandate and the relatively high taxation on diesel fuel, have led to the adoption of AFVs by larger road freight companies. For vehicle producers aiming to scale up the production and sales of AFV, the findings suggest the benefit of targeting diversified and larger road freight companies in the first place.",0965-8564,Not found
Identifying non-universal heterogeneity of preferences of leisure cyclists for rural highway environments: A latent-class model,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104129,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Leisure cycling on rural highways is becoming popular for promoting health and addressing socialization needs. Unlike urban contexts, perception studies of rural leisure cyclists are scarce. This research aims to understand how leisure cyclists perceive rural highway environments accounting for heterogeneous preferences of different cyclist types. An online survey collected 519 complete responses from individuals who cycle for leisure/fitness on rural highways in the US. The results of a mixed-logit model, a mixed-logit model with systematic variation, and a latent-class model with psychometric indicators suggest that self-stated interest and confidence levels (e.g., “enthused and confident”, “strong and fearless”) were not significant enough for segmenting rural cyclists. Instead, distinct groups were segmented based on gender and the relative importance of activity volume, pavement conditions, and environmental conditions. Two classes were identified: Utility-driven enjoyment-seeker and Traffic-indifferent performance-focused. The two classes presented different choice heuristics (random utility maximization vs. attribute non-attendance) and different preferences of design attributes (context class, scenery, shoulder width, or pavement conditions).

Enhancing the perceived resilience of the road transportation system: Utilizing cues from ridesharing,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104131,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Ridesharing plays a potential role in supporting transportation systems. However, the impact of service cues on individuals’ perceptions of transportation system resilience has yet to be fully examined. Building on cue utilization theory, this study adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate the influence of congestion relief services provided by ridesharing platforms on individuals’ perceived resilience and trust in the road transportation system and the impact of passengers’ time urgency in this context. In Phase 1, semi-structured interviews were conducted to identify the cues derived from ridesharing platforms and those utilized by ridesharing users during the processes of calling and waiting for a ride. Subsequently, a research model and hypotheses were proposed. In Phase 2, path analysis was performed to validate the model. Results revealed that the intrinsic and extrinsic cues during the calling and waiting processes enhance individuals’ perceived diagnosticity, further promoting their trust and perceived resilience in the road transportation system. Moreover, as individuals’ trust in the road transportation system increases, their perceived resilience increases. Additionally, passengers’ time urgency negatively moderates the positive relationship between usage flexibility and perceived diagnosticity. Overall, this study enriches existing literature and provides practical implications for traffic management departments in mitigating uncertainty in the road transportation system.",0965-8564,Not found
Pathways toward sustainable aviation: Analyzing emissions from air operations in Europe to support policy initiatives,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104121,186,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Reducing aviation emissions has become a global priority, leading policymakers and industry stakeholders to commit to the achievement of net-zero carbon emissions. Reaching this ambitious goal requires quickly devising and promoting effective policies and measures. Emission levels are heavily influenced by the technological and operational efficiency of airlines and airports. Accordingly, understanding the main patterns underlying aviation emissions is fundamental for evaluating aviation efficiency, ultimately informing the adoption of appropriate policy interventions. In this context, the present study assessed the fuel efficiency and emission patterns of intra-European and intercontinental flights to and from Europe. We estimated the fuel efficiency and carbon intensity of different mission lengths and flight stages using a tool developed by the European Environment Agency and leveraging an extensive flight-level dataset. Our results highlight several critical areas that require policy intervention. First, we found that a relatively high proportion of overall emissions is due to landing and take-off procedures as well as on-ground activities. These emissions tend to be concentrated at major airports due to layout complexities and congestion, necessitating improvements in surface operations at the individual airport and system-wide levels. Second, regional routes represent the most carbon-intense travel segment, emphasizing the need for efficiency improvements. Promoting innovative aircraft technologies can greatly contribute to increase transportation efficiency and potentially improve the economic sustainability of these routes. Third, the majority of emissions from intra-European aviation occur on cross-border routes, underlying the need for coordinated European-level initiatives, such as strengthening cross-border high-speed rail services and implementing infrastructure investments to mitigate emissions.",0965-8564,Not found

This paper presents one of the first studies that aims to investigate the effective technology-enabled solutions that can cater to the diverse needs of rural older adults throughout the entire service process. The study first uses latent class analysis (LCA) structure model to identify three distinct groups of older adults with varying attitudes toward information and transportation technologies: (1) Class 1 – tech-challenged, moderate transportation tech adopters, (2) Class 2 – tech-savvy, modest transportation tech adopters, and (3) Class 3 – tech-savvy, enthusiastic transportation tech adopters. The estimated results from the LCA membership model demonstrated that Class 1 appear to constitute a more vulnerable population compared to their counterparts in Class 2 and Class 3, as they tend to be characterized by older age, lower household income, living alone, and more dependence on mobility aids. The study then delves into qualitative insights through focus group discussions with individuals balanced from these identified groups, revealing ten critical elements that encompass the entirety of service reservation, recommendation, scheduling, and reception. The findings suggest several tech-based solutions, including: (1) the establishment of a regional “one call does it all” center, (2) the implementation of a centralized ride matching and recommendation system, (3) the introduction of an automated scheduling system aligned with healthcare services, and (4) the development of a user-friendly portable device for service reception.

However, comprehensive data on daily virtual and physical activities as well as app usage behaviour remains limited. This paper describes the implementation of a survey to capture cross-dimensional weekly virtual-physical activities diary, including the details of travel, in-home, and out-of-home behaviour, extended smartphone app usage behaviour, and the psychological and perceived built environment factors affecting them. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to expand the panel time-use survey to comprehensively capture daily smartphone app usage, the impact of such usage on travel, and their underlying behaviour (motivations and planned behaviour) in developing countries. Furthermore, it aims to demonstrate the possible usefulness of this dataset in assessing the impact of ICT on travel. The survey was deployed in Jakarta, Bandung, Denpasar, and Cianjur in Indonesia from May 2022 to January 2023. The protocol, mechanism, location, instrument, survey process, and preliminary data are described in the paper. Out of all respondents approached in all cities, 1,193 respondents over 18 years of age, or only 39 %, participated in the study. Respondents reported engaging in 23–32 activities daily and multitasking with average of 2–3 activities. The data collection process for this survey highlighted the importance of utilising both paper-and-pencil surveys and digital questionnaires, providing assistance and incentives, and maintaining open communication with respondents. This approach ensured successful data collection from individuals residing in different Indonesian cities, taking into account their diverse ICT qualities, education levels, and standards of living. Preliminary analysis shows that different combinations of travel and time use characteristics correlate with individuals’ sociodemographic profile and residential location but not all perceived built environment conditions and personality traits. Integrating information on virtual and physical activities into conventional time-use data provides a better understanding of daily activity participation. The result also shows that the impact of app usage on travel varies across sociodemographic groups and cities. Apps usage by senior workers tends to create varied effects, either creation or avoidance of travel. Residents of Jakarta, a megapolitan area that provides more opportunities and economic intensity, tend to use multiple apps to avoid taking trips and generating new activities. The result also demonstrates that leisure app usage has multiple effects on travel and that the generation of new activities is associated with spontaneous app usage decisions.

Hence, there is a need to update any travel behaviour response models that have been developed during the passage of the pandemic. This paper sets out a commuter model for each day of the week for the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area as of September 2022; where the alternative responses are to not work, WFH, or commute by one of ten modes available. Given the probability of WFH obtained from a mixed logit model, we construct a mapping equation to establish the sources of statistical variance by origin and destination locations that influence the incidence of WFH. The evidence is used as the basis of commenting on what this means for longer-term structural changes in network performance, the likely move to a greater focus on living locally, and the need (or otherwise) for employers to retain office space. A significant return to the office has recently been promoted by some employers, and we comment on this as to what it might mean for the future of a hybrid working location model.",0965-8564,Not found

This information was used to quantify the causal effect of the Shinkansen’s opening and to determine whether it resulted in an increase or decrease in the population size of the areas around the Shinkansen stations, all while taking into account the heterogeneity of individual Shinkansen stations. Finally, we reached the following conclusions: (1) The opening of the Shinkansen stations has had a significant impact on population change, and has produced a siphoning effect; (2) the analysis of dynamic effects revealed that different stations have different levels of impact in terms of population change and growth effects; and (3) the Shinkansen stations do not strictly adhere to administrative boundaries in terms of the scope of their impact on population change; rather, they have an effect on a wider geographic space. Finally, we analyzed the benefits and problems associated with the population siphoning effect produced by the Shinkansen in terms of population concentration and population loss in different areas, respectively. It is hoped that this analysis can provide a reference point for planners interested in understanding the broader impacts of large-scale HSR developments, as well as for policymakers who are considering HSR development as a policy tool.",0965-8564,Not found
Investigating the effects of ICT evolution and the COVID-19 pandemic on the spatio-temporal fragmentation of work activities,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104192,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The evolution of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has transformed how, where, and when work activities are performed. Additionally, the work-from-home (WFH) culture has gained traction as a public health strategy to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the past years. Hence, ICTs and the COVID-19 pandemic might have influenced spatial and temporal fragmentation of activities (dismantlement into multiple subtasks and episodes) and changed activity-travel behaviour. In this context, this study investigates the effects of the ICT evolution along with the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the spatio-temporal fragmentation of work activities. Data from the American Time Use Survey from 2003 to 2020 is used to jointly estimate a multiple discrete–continuous probit and multivariate hurdle count model (MDCP-MC). Spatio-temporal fragmentation effects are evaluated considering work activities in three location categories: (1) workplace, (2) home, and (3) other places. Among the study’s main results, first, we observe that ICT evolution led to an increase in the spatial fragmentation of work, as time allocated to work activities in the workplace was transferred into WFH and work from other places. Second, during the COVID-19 pandemic, decreased spatial fragmentation was observed due to stay-at-home social distancing measures. However, temporal fragmentation of work was intensified during the pandemic, especially when individuals worked from home. Finally, workers are found to fragment work differently depending on their socio-demographic characteristics. Specifically, income levels are associated with spatial work fragmentation driven by ICTs, while COVID-19-induced temporal work fragmentation is influenced by occupations and employment characteristics.",0965-8564,Not found
Opening the moral machine's cover: How algorithmic aversion shapes autonomous vehicle adoption,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104193,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Autonomous driving technology has made its way into the market at various levels, yet fully autonomous vehicles remain unavailable. The psychological barriers that must be overcome before fully automated vehicles (AVs) become mainstream are numerous. In addition to technological advancements, persuading consumers to transition from the traditional human-driven model to AVs poses a significant challenge. According to the Moral Machine Experiment, Latin American countries form distinct sub-clusters and exhibit the highest preference for action in moral decision-making. To foster user acceptance of AVs in these countries, it is imperative to comprehend cognitive, affective, and ethical factors. To this end, we conducted experiments with respondents from Colombia to examine how varying levels of automation influence algorithm aversion and user acceptance. Algorithm aversion is explored from two perspectives: ethical judgment and behavior, and emergency evaluation and performance. Our findings reveal two key insights. Firstly, higher levels of automation negatively impact people’s assessment of the emergency evaluation capabilities of AVs, partially contributing to algorithm aversion. Secondly, the intention to use AVs is adversely affected by algorithm aversion, encompassing both ethical considerations and emergency performance-related aspects. Furthermore, mediation analysis demonstrates that perceived hedonism elucidates the inverse relationship between algorithm aversion and the intention to use AVs.",0965-8564,Not found
Human-Machine collaborative decision-making approach to scheduling customized buses with flexible departure times,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104184,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Public transport agencies need to leverage on emerging technologies to remain competitive in a mobility landscape that is increasingly subject to disruptive mobility services ranging from ride-hailing to shared micro-mobility. Customized bus (CB) is an innovative transit system that provides advanced, personalized, and flexible demand-responsive transit service by using digital travel platforms. One of the challenging tasks in planning and operating a CB system is to efficiently and practically schedule a set of CB vehicles while meeting passengers’ personalized travel demand. Previous studies assume that CB passengers’ preferred pickup or delivery time is within a pre-defined hard time window, which is fixed and cannot change. However, some recent studies show that introducing soft flexible time windows can further reduce operational costs. Considering soft flexible time windows, this study first proposes a nearest neighbour-based passenger-to-vehicle assignment algorithm to assign CB passengers to vehicle trips and generate the required vehicle service trips. Then, a novel bi-objective integer programming model is proposed to optimize CB operation cost (measured by fleet size) and level of service (measured by passenger departure time deviation penalty cost). Model reformulations are conducted to make the bi-objective model solvable by using commercial optimization solvers, together with a deficit function-based graphical vehicle scheduling technique. A novel two-stage human–machine collaborative optimization methodology, which makes use of both machine intelligence and human intelligence to collaboratively solve the problem, is developed to generate more practical Pareto-optimal CB scheduling results. Computation results of a real-world CB system demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed optimization model and solution methodology.",0965-8564,Not found
How does social network mediate/moderate the effects of the built environment on travel behavior?,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104175,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Extensive literature has well-documented the impacts of built and social environments on travel behavior. Recently, research attention has focused on the spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic heterogeneities of these impacts. This paper aims to contribute to this growing body of literature by studying the heterogeneity of travel behavior impacts of the built environment among individuals with different social networks. We argue that the built environment may influence travel behavior in different ways for individuals with varying social networks. Using data from a two-day activity-travel diary survey conducted in Shanghai in 2018, we examine how personal social networks mediate and moderate the relationships between the built environment and travel behavior. The modeling results show that personal social networks partially mediate and significantly moderate the effects of the built environment on travel behavior.

Compared to station-based analysis, this study attempted to investigate the key factors affecting the contribution of the first- and last-mile service of bikesharing to public transportation systems from an origin–destination pair perspective. To this end, first-mile transfer trips at the destination stations and the last-mile trips at the origin stations of bikesharing were modeled using bivariate Poisson and bivariate generalized Poisson models based on the bikesharing system in Taipei metropolitan. The estimation results revealed that the BGP model performed better than the BP model, and that the contribution of both the first- and last-mile bikesharing service to public transportation strengthened as a function of a decrease in the bikesharing riding distance, the direction of the bikesharing origin–destination pair heading to central business district, and a high student and employment population.",0965-8564,Not found
Decoding the patterns of critical factor associations driving electric vehicle recommendations,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104171,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This study aims to identify the patterns of key factor combinations that collectively influence consumers to recommend distinct Electric Vehicle (EV) types, namely hydrogen-powered Fuel Cell EVs (FCEVs) and Plug-in EVs (PEVs). To achieve this goal, we apply a non-parametric Association Rules Mining (ARM) approach which unearths latent relationships between different factors in large datasets for analysis. The study utilized the comprehensive 2019 EV user survey data from California, covering socio-economic and demographic characteristics, EV driving and charging habits, housing and parking options, the impact of incentives on EV purchase decisions, and willingness to recommend EVs, among other factors. The results revealed that individuals who find incentives important and experienced a reduced need for refuelling and waiting to refuel their EVs, as well as those who did not have to make special trips to refuel, were more likely to recommend FCEVs. Besides, the availability of home charging facilities and variable electricity rates highly influenced consumers to recommend PEVs. Also, individuals who frequently drove and had positive experiences with both EV types were highly likely to recommend them. Although FCEV users are concerned about station availability when travelling, and PEV users worry about the high cost of EVs, they are still willing to recommend them. The findings highlight critical factors that can enhance EV recommendations and increase adoption rates. Understanding these patterns enables policymakers and industry players to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy and mitigate climate change impacts.",0965-8564,Not found
Free public transport to the destination: A causal analysis of tourists’ travel mode choice,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104166,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"In this paper, we assess the impact of a fare-free public transport policy for overnight guests on travel mode choice to a Swiss tourism destination. The policy directly targets domestic transport to and from a destination, the substantial contributor to the CO 2 emissions of overnight trips. Based on a survey sample, we identify the effect with the help of the random element that the information on the offer from a hotelier to the guest varies in day-to-day business. We estimate a shift from private cars to public transport due to the policy of, on average, 14.8 and 11.6 percentage points, depending on the application of propensity score matching and causal forest. This knowledge is relevant for policy-makers to design future public transport policies for tourists.

Are consumers ready to pay extra for crowd-shipping e-groceries and why? A hybrid choice analysis for developing economies,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104177,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This paper presents the results of a behavioral study on consumers’ willingness-to-pay the extra for e-grocery deliveries based on crowd-shipping. The proposed methodology was tested for Ukraine, i.e., a developing country where the crowd-shipping services are under development conditions. The choice model was enhanced with two latent variables to account for the behavior complexity of the consumers who have not faced crowd-shipping services in the past. These variables were extracted through factor analysis to encompass pro-crowd-shipping and pro-commercial carrier attributes. The willingness-to-pay for e-grocery deliveries based on crowd-shipping and commercial carriers was estimated using hybrid choice modeling results. The findings indicate more than two times higher willingness-to-pay for saving delivery time for crowd-shipping compared to commercial carrier services. Discrete choice analysis of consumer-related attributes identified males with cons-crowd-shipping attitudes. Age-wise, consumers younger than 30 years exhibited pro-crowd-shipping behavior. The direct and cross elasticities have been estimated to evaluate the impacts of variation in service-specific attributes on the consumer’s behavior within e-groceries scope.",0965-8564,Not found
Assessing travelers’ preferences for online bus-hailing service across various travel distances: Insights from Chinese metropolitan areas,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104159,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This study conducts a stated preference survey to assess travelers’ preferences for online bus-hailing service across various travel distances in Chinese metropolitan areas. By collecting personal attributes, travel characteristics, and scenario variables (including fares, walking distance, waiting time, and travel time for various ground transportation services), we develop a travel mode choice model based on XGBoost and examine the positive and negative effects and elasticity of different influencing factors. Empirical results demonstrate that the XGBoost-based travel mode choice model performs best in predictive accuracy, proving its superior fitting capability. Meanwhile, travel distance is pivotal in determining travelers’ preferences. Short-distance travelers prioritize time efficiency, whereas as travel distance increases, travelers become less sensitive to time, and fares become the primary consideration. This shift provides service operators with opportunities to implement differentiated strategies. The remaining travel modes also significantly influence choice preferences, with travelers critically concerned about the time cost of regular bus service and highly sensitive to taxi/car-hailing service fares. Personal attributes and travel characteristics, such as gender, age, and the number of companions, also impact choice preferences, providing opportunities for service operators to offer personalized services. Elasticity analysis further confirms the role of each influencing factor in increasing the attractiveness of choosing online bus-hailing service. Ultimately, we derive significant insights at the planning level, including single-factor optimization and prioritizing optimization for different dual-factor combinations. These insights serve as a basis for urban managers to formulate and enhance online bus-hailing service, covering aspects such as fare incentive policies and route service frequencies.",0965-8564,Not found
Navigating acceptance and controversy of transport policies,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104176,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The current study contributes to the literature by exploring the acceptance and controversy surrounding different transport policies, examining how public preferences/attitudes explain these dispositions in the context of transitions towards more sustainable transport systems. A random and representative Norwegian-population-based sample (n = 1002) was used for the analysis purpose. A two-fold approach is employed. A principal component analysis is performed first to determine which transport policies (20 policies) are homogeneously evaluated. Secondly, a latent class analysis is used to classify unobserved subgroups of people and distinguish classes of acceptance/controversy patterns. We identify three distinct components of public evaluations of transport policies: “traditional pull policies” focusing on non-restrictive strategies such as incentives for public transport; “car-based push policies” focusing on actively limiting car use; and “emerging policies” focusing on innovative technologies such as electrification and automation. The latent class analysis uncovers six distinct classes, illustrating a spectrum of preferences and attitudes. These classes encompass individuals ranging from strong opposition and neutrality to strong support for various policy types. A highly environmentally conscious class, characterized by higher education levels, strongly supports diverse transport policies, including push and emerging measures, showcasing a commitment to sustainability and readiness for personal sacrifices. However, challenges arise from a class that strongly opposes all types of policies, including traditional pull measures. This class exhibits robust expectations and concerns about policy (features) impacts such as clarity, effectiveness, and fairness, and it is skewed towards a higher proportion of men, with relatively older members. Moreover, they have concerns that such policies might cause adverse consequences for them, such as additional travel time and reduced social interactions. In conclusion, the diverse patterns identified within the population highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to developing transport policies. For the transition towards more sustainable transport systems, the findings show potential for more radical transport policies compared to today’s policy landscape.",0965-8564,Not found
The effects of participating in digital ride-hailing on taxi drivers’ business operations,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104167,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The advent of the digital ride-hailing business model has disrupted the for-hire ride service industry. After the progressive protests from traditional taxi drivers, many countries have imposed strict regulations on the operation of digital ride-hailing. This paper provides the first evidence that, by allowing for dynamic pricing, regulating digital ride-hailing services to comply with the safety and licensing requirements akin to those applied to traditional taxi services can further improve the welfare of taxi drivers. Using nationally representative survey data of taxi drivers in Taiwan and analytical strategies that address the nonrandom selection issue, we quantify the impact of a government-mandated digital ride-sharing system known as the “Multipurpose Taxi Program” on for-hire drivers’ business operation and performance. We find that participation in this program increases drivers’ profits by at least 11 %, which can be attributed to both better driver-rider matching efficiency and the dynamic pricing scheme offered by digital ride-hailing. In addition, the program leads to better protection for customers. Participating in the program makes drivers are more likely to purchase passenger insurance by at least 44 %. We further point out that the effect of the program is heterogeneous in that this program decreases the profits of taxi drivers who primarily rely on radio or phone dispatches, but not street searching.",0965-8564,Not found
The dynamic role of subsidies in promoting global electric vehicle sales,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104173,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"We offer the most comprehensive analysis to date of global plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) subsidies, a key part of countries’ strategies to reduce transport carbon emissions and meet Paris Agreement goals. We accomplish this by estimating vehicle choice models for 23 countries using 2010–2019 sales data and using counterfactual simulations to assess the cost-effectiveness of PEV incentives. We also provide the first-ever analysis of medium-run effects, finding that subsidies increase sales not only in the year they are offered, but also in subsequent years. Incentive policies are expensive, costing between $14,857 and $62,443 per additional PEV sold ($11-$36 per additional gallon of gasoline avoided, or upwards of $1,212 per avoided metric ton of carbon dioxide). However, when factoring in medium-run effects, most countries’ cost-effectiveness improves substantially. Cost-effectiveness of PEV subsidies has generally been flat to improving over the last decade, suggesting subsidies, though expensive, remain an important driver of PEV adoption.",0965-8564,Not found
Evaluation system for urban traffic intelligence based on travel experiences: A sentiment analysis approach,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104170,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Precise and comprehensive evaluation of urban traffic intelligence plays a vital role in the development of intelligent transportation systems. However, the majority of existing evaluation methods primarily rely on physical measurements, thereby overlooking the travel experiences of traffic participants. This results in a significant discrepancy between the expected outcomes of transportation design and the actual perceived travel experiences. Therefore, this study proposes a data-driven evaluation system for urban traffic intelligence based on travel experiences. In particular, the travel experiences of the public are extracted from social media data and evaluated by a sentiment analysis approach. Firstly, an indicator library is established through literature research, and it is further enhanced by a survey to ensure its comprehensiveness. After that, the text data scraped from social media posts is classified into the corresponding indicators via a pre-trained language model. We then employ a lexicon-based model to conduct sentiment analysis on the classified text data. Specifically, the lexicon-based model can not only identify the polarity of the text data but also determine the intensity of the sentiment expressed. To address the imbalanced distribution of social media data, we employ the oversampling technique to correct the data skewness. The proposed method is tested in Shanghai, China, and the results demonstrate consistency with those obtained from the analytic hierarchy process with survey data. Furthermore, the sentiment analysis approach exhibits stable performance even when provided with a limited amount of input data. The evaluation results indicate that the information accessibility and flexibility of urban transportation in Shanghai are satisfactory. However, there is a need for further improvement in the areas of safety, comfort, and affordability based on the analysis of travel experiences.",0965-8564,Not found
What to do with commuting time when driving autonomous vehicles? Results of a stated intention experiment,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104165,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Rapid improvements in autonomous driving technology and the availability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to change people’s habitual travel patterns. Fully autonomous vehicles (FAVs) do not need to be maneuvered by their users, implying users are allowed to participate in a number of non-driving in-vehicle activities (IVAs) when their FAV is bringing them to their destination. People can therefore use their travel time for working, relaxation, entertainment, communication and possibly other activities. Since FAVs provide a different environment than traditional travel modes, such as trains and busses, people’s preferences for conducting IVAs in FAV travel has become an emerging issue in transportation research. Understanding people’s preferences for conducting IVAs during FAV travel will generate important information for future vehicle interior design and the development of transportation policies. Hence, this paper presents the outcomes of a research study that aims at increasing our understanding of the intentions of individuals to conduct IVAs when travelling by FAV’s and the endogenous and exogenous factors and variables influencing these intentions. We designed an experiment and analyzed the response data using simultaneous equation modeling to examine the intentions to conduct IVAs during FAV travel and potential correlations that may exist across IVAs. The results show significant heterogeneity in IVA intentions and correlations between IVAs. Youngsters, high-education-level groups, and employed show a higher intention to engage in most IVAs. In addition, gender, household income, motion sickness, and license ownership affect people’s intentions. The estimated results suggest that the intentions to conduct IVAs depend on trip length. Moreover, the potential correlation between IVAs is confirmed. For example, respondents who have intentions to conduct to sleep show interest in eating or drinking and play games, but are not inclined to work with a computer. In contrast, respondents who intend to use social media during FAV travel are less likely to sleep when travelling by FAV.",0965-8564,Not found

In car-dominated environments, the challenge is in retrofitting existing infrastructure to enable and encourage walking. It is unclear what diverse people might find difficult and to what extent existing design recommendations identify those needs. This study aims to provide a real-world perspective on local design guidelines and the Healthy Streets metrics, by triangulating them with objective measures of the built environment and users’ perceptions of unfeasibility or difficulty. The study builds on previous research having identified non-signalised crossing points experienced by interview participants (half of whom were disabled) as barriers to access. These non-walkable crossings are characterised objectively, using a range of potentially relevant metrics and specific thresholds. The study then sought the simplest way to describe those crossings, identifying the importance of three metrics: (a) peak-hour traffic; (b) complexity; and (c) turning radii for traffic. The results also identified important gaps in local design guidelines and Healthy Streets metrics, which are currently not set up to enable cities to easily identify these difficult crossings. These findings are important because they can be used to identify crossings that are likely to cause difficulties walking and should be retrofitted to support walking. They also provide indications of complementary information needed to improve local guidelines and Healthy Streets metrics to enable them to support proactive retrofit.",0965-8564,Not found

We focus specifically on the proportion of unauthorized Latin American immigrants in California who commute by car, drive alone to work, and commute by public transit, testing a number of model specifications and proxies for identifying undocumented immigrant residents. We find that the implementation of AB 60 was associated with a 2.0 percentage-point increase in car commuting and a 4.2 percentage-point increase in driving to work alone by unauthorized immigrants. Results also show a 1.4 percentage-point decline in the rate of commuting by public transit after AB 60′s implementation.

Profiling future passenger transport initiatives to identify the growing role of active and micro-mobility modes,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104172,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"There is growing interest in recognising the role that active and micro-mobility modes play in the full suite of modal-based activities. While the idea of the ’next normal’ since the heady days of COVID-19 remains unclear, there are signs that living locally and the impact of increased working from home, has generated greater interest in active travel and micro-mobility for local trips, but also as ways to access and/or egress modes for longer trips. A new travel and mobility survey has been designed in which revealed and stated preference data are collected to identify current and future interest in using motorised and non-motorised modes in a typical week. It considers mode use for all stages of a door-to-door journey in an extensive number of trip profiles. Trip frequency over a 7-day week is much more informative than the more traditional choice of a mode survey approach for a typical day. We estimate a series of negative binomial models on the stated preference (SP) scenario data to gain an understanding of the role that active and micro-mobility modes play as access, egress, and linehaul modes in an origin–destination trip. The descriptive profiles and estimated models provide a way to identify and hence focus the treatment of active and micro-mobility modes in government policy settings designed to support the move to more sustainable modes for all local passenger trips. The modes showing the most potential from the SP inquiry include EV car driver, car passenger, walk and E-bike/E-Scooter, if external conditions allow (i.e., similar to SP scenarios when external restrictions are removed).

The construction process of a land-air collaboration composite transportation network is first presented. Then, we further delve into the characterization of impedance function for various link types, using the classical queuing model that accounts for system capacity constraints. Subsequently, we develop a novel land-air collaboration network equilibrium (LAC-NE) model integrating the UAM concept, and it is translated into an equivalent mathematical programming problem, which admits solution existence and uniqueness. To efficiently address the model, based on the path-based gradient projection (GP) algorithm, an improved version with the path generation scheme is proposed. We conduct numerical experiments under diverse scenario settings to demonstrate the applicability of the LAC-NE model. These experiments examine the effects of UAM mode on network performance, revealing that the inclusion of land-air collaboration mode travelers would lead to distinct equilibrium states and network performance indicators. Furthermore, in comparison to the traditional network equilibrium model, the proposed model takes into account advanced low-altitude transportation (ALT), effectively alleviating urban traffic congestion.

Evaluating parcel delivery strategies in different terrain conditions,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104158,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The impacts of the e-commerce growth have increased the urgency in designing and adopting new alternative delivery strategies. In this context, it is important to consider the particularities of each city like its terrain conditions. This article aims at exploring the impact of road slopes on parcel delivery operations, and how they condition the adoption and implementation of alternative, more sustainable delivery strategies. To this end, a microscopic traffic simulator was used to evaluate different delivery strategies including ICE vans, electric vans, and cargo bikes in three different slope scenarios. This evaluation was based on a medium-sized European city and conducted by comparing the same parcel delivery route at three levels: operational (route length, duration, and waiting time), energy consumption, and emissions. The results revealed that as the road slopes increased, more time was needed to deliver all packages, waiting times grew longer, and vehicles’ energy consumption and emissions levels intensified. From the flat terrain to the most sloped terrain, there was an increase in duration of around 5% for traditional and electric vans, 35% for large cargo bikes, and 14% for small cargo bikes. The ICE van suffers a 105% increase in waiting time; the electric van 71%; the large cargo bike 68% and the small cargo bike 52%. Energy consumption also varied, with ICE vans and small cargo bikes consuming nearly 30% more energy, while electric vans and large cargo bikes consumed 4% and 60% more energy, respectively. The ICE van’s emissions of CO, HC, PM x , NO x , and CO 2 are 13%, 10%, 1%, 20%, and 29% higher, respectively. Moreover, in flatter terrains, the better strategies are the electric van or a large cargo bike, while in more sloped terrains, the most adequate one is the electric van. These findings suggest that the electric van is the best overall strategy for different terrains and different decision-making profiles, ranking first in more than 70% of the profiles across all three terrains.",0965-8564,Not found
Stressors for bus commuters and ways of improving bus journeys,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104164,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Based on the people-environment conceptual framework, this paper measures the level of transport stress experienced by bus commuters and examines its relationship with a wide range of environmental and personal stressors, as well as different stress responses. A total of 28 environmental stressors, 9 personal stressors, 4 time-related stressors and 6 stated stress responses are examined. The data were collected through a large-scale online questionnaire survey among bus commuters of a major franchised bus company in Hong Kong (n = 5,908). A factor analysis and a structural equation model (SEM) are conducted to unveil the interlinkages among bus-related environmental stressors, personal stressors, travel characteristics, perceived transport stress and stated stress responses. Results indicate that bus commuters reported an average stress level of 47.10 out of 100 (SD = 29.50). The average transport stress level is lower than money, work and family stress but higher than relationship stress. Spatially, there are great variations within the city, with notably higher stress levels for some new towns in Northwest New Territories and the central business district during evening commutes. Based on the SEM results, the number of bus transfers (β = 0.05) and travel time (β = 0.06) are strongly associated with transport stress. Poor bus stop environment (β = 0.14), crowding at bus stops and compartments (β = 0.13), hostile attitudes of passengers and drivers (β = 0.08), and unreliable waiting and travel time (β = 0.08) are important environmental stressors. Many of these factors have not been closely examined in previous studies. In relation to health, transport stress is positively associated with negative physical (β = 0.43) and emotional (β = 0.48) responses. Feeling exhausted, irritated and anxiety were the most commonly reported responses to transport stress. To enhance bus commutes, priorities should be given to improving the bus stop environment, reducing crowding throughout the bus journeys, and alleviating road congestion.

Several operational strategies have been investigated and are expected to reduce the environmental impact of contrails. For instance, flight routes can be modified spatially to avoid ice-supersaturated regions, thus the formation of contrails. Alternatively, flights can be rescheduled to other time slots when the time-dependent effect of contrails is reduced. Adjusting flights has a complex and cascading effect on airlines and the setup of the airline network. This paper aims at understanding and measuring these propagated consequences. However, on a more global basis, this study aims at introducing an approach of understanding and measuring the general changes of network effects induced by external network adaptations that are not limited to rescheduling flights. To do so, this study investigates the impact of short-term operational adjustments on the scheduling of an airline network. Therefore, means to measure the impact of minor network adaptations on the airline networks including the operation of the fleet, the robustness and the demand are introduced. Additionally, the ability of the network to offset any losses by supplemental network enhancement is investigated. The losses can be partially compensated for by modifying the fleet assignment and rescheduling additional short-haul flights within the network. In order to demonstrate the approach, this study examines the impact of rescheduling flights to minimize contrail-induced climate effects on airline networks and the resulting costs for airline operations. The findings of the study suggest that even airline networks with restricted dynamics are capable of adapting to required rescheduling to reduce the impact and formation of contrails.",0965-8564,Not found
A decision framework for improving the service quality of charging stations based on online reviews and evolutionary game theory,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104168,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"With “charging anxiety” gradually replacing “range anxiety” as the major obstacle for consumers to purchase electric vehicles (EVs), the quantity-driven rather than quality-driven charging station development model barely meets the development of the EV market. It is of great practical significance that a comprehensive and in-depth insight into charging stations’ customer requirements (CRs) to uncover their pain points and improvement measures. Therefore, this study develops a decision framework for improving EV charging service quality based on quality function deployment (QFD). First, CRs are extracted based on charging station online reviews and classified by the revised importance performance analysis (IPA) method to identify the charging service’s main highlights and pain points. Then, the process of achieving consensus among experts on evaluating the correlation between CRs and service design requirements (DRs) is considered as an evolutionary game of coalition, with a meritocratic Fermi rule considering affinities (MFA) being introduced. Finally, the importance of DRs is determined by combining the Shapley value and risk aversion theory. The results indicate that regulation and convenience are the main highlights of charging stations to satisfy EV users, while reliability and assurance are primary pain points. The charging station operators should prioritize their limited resources on providing efficient customer and maintenance services, installing charging stations with international standards, and regularly inspecting and updating charging infrastructures. This study is beneficial for charging station operators to understand what customers want and how to satisfy them.",0965-8564,Not found
The ease of travel: A person-based measure of people's ability to travel,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104174,187,2024-09-01,2024,9,"In this paper I present the concept of “ease of travel”. Ease of travel (EoT) refers to how easily people can travel given their travel motivation, travel skills, travel options, and travel quality. EoT may differ by mode and influence people’s travel behaviour, participation in out-of-home activities and experience of travel. EoT differs from the commonly used (perceived) accessibility concept, which mainly focuses on activity destinations and (perceptions towards) built environment characteristics. EoT, on the other hand, focuses on travel and highlights personal abilities and motivations for travel. It may provide valuable insights in people’s travel behaviour intentions and can help in creating more sustainable travel patterns, but also in stimulating better access to out-of-home activities and generating satisfying travel, thereby improving people’s subjective well-being. EoT may serve as a user-friendly and policy-relevant tool to assess people’s ability to travel. In this paper, a conceptual framework is presented and measures of EoT are tested using a sample of 2,593 University students and staff. Results suggest that a subdivision of EoT in four elements is reliable. Finally, I also present avenues for further research.",0965-8564,Not found
Preference heterogeneity analysis on train choice behaviour of high-speed railway passengers: A case study in China,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104198,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"This study aims at revealing and quantifying preference heterogeneity on train choice behaviour of high-speed railway (HSR) passengers to better-improving the quality of passenger service. The analysis is performed using characteristic data and 3,355 unlabeled stated preference (SP) experiments data from 671 respondents on Nanning-Guangzhou passenger corridor in China. Utilizing Expectation-Maximization (EM) iterations, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) identified four heterogeneous travel groups among HSR passengers based on SED and travel characteristics variables, named as Price-Sensitive (PS), General Business (GB), Peak-hours Enthusiastic (PE), and Leisure Experience Focuser (LEF). The Random Parameter Logit (RPL) estimation revealed the preference heterogeneity of the four groups regarding basic attributes (ticket price, travel time, departure date), additional service attributes (catering reservations-to-seats, silent carriages, large luggage check-in), and departure time (peak hours, flat hours, valley hours) of high-speed trains. The willingness to pay of different groups for these attributes also showed distinct differences. In addition, the two-step approach GMM-RPL with the integration of machine learning, demonstrating the enhanced interpretability and capability for latent heterogeneity identification compared to Latent Class Choice Model (LCCM).

An influence path analytic study for the operational performance of large passenger railway stations: The China case,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104213,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"The knowledge development of the influence mechanism for the operational performance of large passenger railway stations (OPLPRS) is of great significance for station managers in making comprehensive management decisions, particularly in determining the decision direction under limited allocatable resources. Hence, this paper is dedicated to conducting an empirical study on the influence path analysis of OPLPRS to enrich the relevant theoretical development and better assist in the choice of decision direction at the macro level. First, a hierarchical performance component system (HPCS) with multiple groupings is developed for OPLPRS, and several hypotheses are formulated for its internal structural relationships. Then, a multi-path analytic method based on structural equation modeling (SEM-MPAM) is proposed to (1) establish and validate the conceptual structure of HPCS and measure each path coefficient inside, and (2) quantitatively analyze the direct, indirect, and compound influence paths of each performance component or group on the OPLPRS with and without considering the decision timeliness. Survey data from two representative large passenger railway stations in China is applied to the proposed SEM-MPAM to conduct the influence path analysis. The results well support the developed hypotheses and path structure, yield the influence intensity of multiple paths, and therefore identify the critical influence paths of the OPLPRS under different conditions. Finally, the practical implications gained, the applications of multi-path analytic findings in meeting different decision-making needs, and the applicability of the proposed method are discussed, which helps station managers better seek the optimal improvement of OPLPRS in practice.",0965-8564,Not found
The willingness to pay for the automated vehicle subscription: Insights from a car-oriented population in China,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104188,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"In the rapidly advancing field of automated driving systems, the automated vehicle subscription (AVS) can provide the easiness of trialing the latest automated vehicle (AV) technologies at a monthly cost and gather significant customer interest. However, a gap in the literature remains regarding attitudes and willingness to pay (WTP) towards this innovative business model AVS, which is an alternative to the widely studied Self-owned AV and shared AV (SAV). Thus, we conducted a stated preference (SP) survey among the car-oriented population in China to assess the willingness to pay for the automated vehicle subscription, investigating its potential among the non-automated vehicle, Self-owned AV, and SAV. In the context of level 4 AVs, mixed logit model results reveal that automated vehicle subscription stands out among all AV alternatives, with all respondents demonstrating a positive willingness to pay for the automated vehicle subscription. In comparison, respectively 96 % and 71 % of the respondents have a positive willingness to pay for the Self-owned AV and SAV. Meanwhile, compared to a non-automated vehicle with a fixed ownership cost of 300 K CNY (1CNY = 0.14US$) and assuming a 10-CNY trip cost for the most frequent trip, the median willingness to pay of an AV is (1) 3 K CNY/month for the automated vehicle subscription; (2) an extra 130 K CNY for a Self-owned AV; (3) 418 CNY/month for an SAV. Furthermore, the purpose of travel, income, and individual attitudes toward automated driving significantly influence the willingness to pay for the automated vehicle subscription. Notably, individuals traveling for business purpose and belonging to the high-income group show a stronger inclination towards the automated vehicle subscription. Overall, automated vehicle subscription has a high willingness to pay and is shown to be a promising path forward in AV adoption.",0965-8564,Not found
Government policies on port resilience amid strike events—A two-stage Van Damme based tripartite evolutionary game,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104196,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"In contrast to natural phenomena, such as extreme weather, accidents, disasters, and public health emergencies, labor strikes are human-induced emergent circumstances arising from low real wages in most cases. During disputes with ports, the labor typically exerts control over the duration and scale of strikes to negotiate improved benefits, while port authorities may seek collaboration with neighboring ports to enhance resilience and mitigate transportation disruption risks. Should the government participate as a third party in the game as an indirect stakeholder? The government must assess the necessity of engagement in the first stage and select an appropriate strategy in the second. Within the framework of tripartite equilibrium, this study examines the evolutionary paths of stability points, dual-stable states, and unstable states under different government engagement policies, as well as the influence of each factor on the tripartite strategy choice. The results reveal that (1) the right timing and policies for government engagement can mitigate more than half of the damage from the strike to the overall system; (2) port alliances can speed up 50 % of the evolution time of the labor to terminate the strike; (3) the government will play the dominant role when the risk of the strike to labor is increased; and (4) the expected duration of strikes can have an inverted “U”-shaped effect on port strategies but a “U”-shaped effect on government policies. The application of the two-stage evolutionary game model in this study develops an analytical framework that provides better reference for the government’s actual decision-making.",0965-8564,Not found
Urban Aerial Mobility for airport shuttle service,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104202,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Airport shuttle service is regarded as one of the most promising use cases for the early deployment of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). This study introduces an integrated modeling framework for UAM-based airport shuttles. The framework covers strategic decisions, including site selection, route planning, fleet size design, and station capacity design, as well as operational considerations such as demand estimation, service level determination, and scheduling. This framework aims to provide UAM stakeholders with an optimization and management solution that incorporates the above integrated decisions. Through a case study at Beijing Capital International Airport, several notable findings emerge: (1) UAM demonstrates feasibility in airport shuttles, offering a minimum 28.4% reduction in travel time while maintaining costs comparable to alternative modes. (2) The system exhibits robustness and high service quality, effectively accommodating 94.8% of reserved orders and 90.7% of ad-hoc orders. (3) Larger-capacity eVTOLs (e.g., 5–6 passengers) are well-suited to expedite UAM deployment for airport shuttle services. (4) Emphasizing the importance of vehicle performance, a high cruise speed correlates with revenue growth approximating linear progression, highlighting its significance for the advancement of UAM.

An investigation into the potential use of information and communication technologies by trip-deprived older adults in New Jersey,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104199,188,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Past studies show that trip deprivation or unmet mobility adversely affects older adults’ objective and subjective well-being. Researchers are optimistic that new trip-enhancing technologies (e.g., ridehailing and autonomous vehicles) and trip-substituting information and communication technologies (ICTs) could potentially reduce those impacts. Against that backdrop, this paper compares ICT access and use among trip-deprived (TD) and non-trip-deprived (NTD) older adults of New Jersey by analyzing survey data from 2357 respondents. The data were analyzed by logit models, propensity score matching (PSM), and χ2 tests. Logit models showed that certain characteristics of the TD are similar to the characteristics of the ICT non-users (e.g., people with low income and disability). The PSM analysis, which generated a matched dataset of an equal number of TD and NTD older adults, showed that the TD have lower access to computers with internet but equal access to smartphones. The results showed that the only ICT that is used more by the TD than the NTD is ridehailing. The TD were not found to use trip-substituting ICTs like online shopping, online banking, videoconferencing, etc., more than the NTD. Emphasizing that transportation improvements remain important in light of the results, χ2 tests were undertaken to compare the improvements recommended by the two groups. The paper recommends the separation of the TD and the NTD for planning purposes, collection of trip deprivation data by transportation planning agencies, and the consideration of ICT use by the Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility at the federal level.",0965-8564,Not found

Resilience evaluation and improvement of post-disaster multimodal transportation networks,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104243,189,2024-11-01,2024,11,"As a type of critical infrastructure, multimodal transportation networks are susceptible to disturbances from natural disasters and intentional attacks. Resilience reflects the performance of a multimodal transportation network after suffering from a disaster, and the failure of this network influences the public life and induces economic losses. This research aims to evaluate and improve the resilience of post-disaster multimodal intercity transportation networks to mitigate negative influences of disturbances. A comprehensive resilience performance metric, accounting for influences on unserved demand and adaptation of served demand was proposed to evaluate the resilience of multimodal transportation networks. The multimodal traffic assignment model was developed to derive the components of this comprehensive performance metric, integrating user equilibrium and modal split, while considering the capacity upper bound of some links. A route-based link recovery sequence was also proposed to improve network resilience, taking into account interdependencies and utilization of damaged links. The operational measure of capacity enlargement of functioning links was adopted to supplement the recovery sequence. The proposed resilience evaluation and improvement method was applied to a multimodal transportation network, namely, the constituent road, rail, and air networks in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei–Shandong region. Results show that the proposed route-based strategy outperforms volume-based, betweenness-based, and random strategies in enhancing resilience. Capacity enlargement of functioning links can further improve resilience by accommodating more affected demand, particularly effectively in scenarios characterized by inefficient repair sequences, higher fixed demand and a larger punishment multiplier. These findings highlight the interdependencies of links in establishing the recovery sequence, capacity enlargement in challenging scenarios, and enhanced availability and convenience of transportation modes to promote multimodal network resilience after a disruption.",0965-8564,Not found
Transport disadvantage and social inclusion: Exploring the role of smartphone use for transport purposes,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104240,189,2024-11-01,2024,11,"The link between transport disadvantage and social exclusion is now firmly-established. Smartphones emerge as an integral part of daily life with a strong potential to influence this link by improving people’s capacity to access transport information and availability, and enabling direct connections with others in society. However, the role of smartphone use for transport purposes in influencing people’s daily mobility and quality of life remains under-studied, in part impeding a more concrete discourse on how it can be better evaluated and considered in policymaking. This study seeks to shed light on the above issue through probing into the interrelationships among smartphone use, transport disadvantage and social inclusion, and their relation to subjective well-being. Using Beijing as a case study, we tested a series of hypotheses through structural equation models (SEM). Our findings highlighted potentially bidirectional interactions between smartphone use and transport disadvantage. By and large, smartphone use for both normal purposes and new modes can help mitigate transport disadvantage, and this may further stimulate more smartphone use as a proactive solution. Furthermore, the link between smartphone use for new modes and transport cost, and their consequent effect on social inclusion and subjective well-being were found to vary between low- and high-income groups. Findings suggest that smartphones and smart apps should be carefully integrated in policymaking to reduce the risk for people of being socially excluded due to a lack of transport options and improve subjective well-being.",0965-8564,Not found
Nonlinear influences of landscape configurations and walking access to transit services on travel satisfaction,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104232,189,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Walking, as a form of active travel, has played a significant role in facilitating sustainable transport and the development of the built environment. A growing number of studies have examined the relationships between the built environment and active travel trips around transit stations. However, travellers’ propensity to walk to transit stops and their travel satisfaction with doing so, particularly for first-mile trips, and its relationship with the built environment, in developing countries, have so far received little attention in the literature. Thus, this paper examines the nonlinear influences of landscape configurations, walking access to transit services and the interactions between them on travel satisfaction. Gradient boosting decision tree models are used to control for trip attributes and factors related to the built environment both in residential areas and business/commercial districts where a lot of transit stations are located. We combine street view data and individual survey data for the Beijing metropolitan area to document that improving walking access to transit services has significant effects on travel satisfaction. The results show that landscape configurations tend to have nonlinear associations with walking access to transit services as well as having pronounced interaction effects on travel satisfaction. The findings of this study demonstrate the importance of planning the spatial placement of stations to make them more convenient and improve people’s travel satisfaction with first-mile journeys made on foot.",0965-8564,Not found
Does the shipping alliance aggravate or alleviate container shipping market volatility,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104231,189,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Frequent and dramatic container shipping market turbulence has caused concerns among shipping stakeholders and governments around the world. While exogenous shocks such as economic recessions and pandemics are attributed to such turbulence, the changing shipping market structure with the formation of shipping alliances could also play a moderating role. The US government has begun to stipulate stricter policies that restrict shipping alliance development and aim to stabilize the freight rate. In this paper, we examine how shipping alliances can moderate freight rate volatility in the container shipping market. An analytical economic model is first derived to generate theoretical predictions, and an empirical study is then conducted by using real-world shipping market data to verify the theoretical predictions. Specifically, our analytical results suggest that shipping alliances can aggravate the volatility of freight rates when the market shock is from the demand side while alleviating the volatility caused from the supply side. Moreover, shipping alliances always lead to lower volatility in port charges. When the shipping demand (or shipping fuel price, respectively) is stochastic, the alliance-induced cost savings through economies of scale have no impact (or increases, respectively) on differences in volatility in both port charges and shipping freights with and without a shipping alliance. On the basis of panel data of 10 selected Chinese major container shipping routes from 2010 to 2021, a panel data regression model with two-way fixed effects (TWFE) is estimated. The empirical results confirm our analytical conclusions. We construct an integrated economic model to reveal that shipping alliances can affect market risk in a rather implicit way, i.e., through freight rate volatility, which has not been explored. Moreover, our empirical study results support the theoretical results and accurately quantify the impacts of shipping alliances on main international container shipping routes, thereby providing related policy implications for regulators.",0965-8564,Not found

Synergizing shared micromobility and public transit towards an equitable multimodal transportation network,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104225,189,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This paper assesses the equity impacts of shared micromobility and investigates regulatory policies that improve transport equity and promote synergy between public transit and shared micromobility. We consider a multimodal transportation network, where a micromobility platform deploys docking stations and operates a fleet of micromobility vehicles to provide shared micromobility services and a public transit agency offers transit services over a transportation network. A market equilibrium model is developed to capture the intimate interactions among access and egress times of shared micromobility services, waiting times of transit services, the spatial distribution of docking stations, passenger demand, platform pricing and fleet sizing, vehicle repositioning and the micromobility platform profit. The platform decision problem is cast as a high-dimensional non-convex program. A solution method is proposed to efficiently compute the solution through problem reformulation and dimensionality reduction. Based on the proposed framework, we evaluate spatial equity in transport accessibility using the Gini index, and find that although shared micromobility improves overall transport accessibility, the benefits are not fairly distributed across different geographic zones, which leads to enlarged spatial inequity gaps after introducing shared micromobility. To promote transport equity, we investigate three policy directions: (a) to impose a vehicle density floor on shared micromobility; (b) to offer a subsidy on shared micromobility rides for first/last-mile connections; and (c) to promote collaboration between public transit and shared micromobility. We show that different regulatory policies have advantages and limitations. The minimum vehicle density requirement can simultaneously improve spatial equity and passengers’ surplus, but has limited equity improvements. In contrast, the subsidy on bundled services could significantly mitigate spatial inequity, but it hurts passengers and the platform profit. Compared to the other two policies, the transit-micromobility collaboration can lead to higher equity improvement, higher passenger surplus, while offering a guarantee on the platform profit, which turns out to be the most cost-effective approach. These insights are validated through realistic numerical studies for San Francisco.",0965-8564,Not found
Classifying 15-minute Cities: A review of worldwide practices,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104234,189,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Amongst the most popular alternatives to the current car-dominant planning model to have emerged in recent times is the 15-minute City (15mC). The 15mC prioritises the notion of local living. It seeks to address the pressing challenges of urban life by promoting lifestyles largely independent of motorised travel modes by focusing on active mobility and proximity to essential amenities. Despite the popularity of this concept, a knowledge gap exists regarding the diverse range of international practical definitions, strategies, instruments, and implementation experiences, as well as the requirements for, and challenges involved in, operationalising the 15mC and related concepts. Consequently, this paper seeks to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the implementation of 15-minute cities and associated practices worldwide by combining an extensive literature review of both academic and grey literature sources with an expert survey. This culminates in the creation of a classification typology for the 15mC, based on the diversity of contexts and practices found, and informed by the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DOI). Almost one hundred cities were identified as either in the process of implementing or planning to implement the 15mC concept. A diverse assortment of associated practices was identified, ranging from supporting active mobility to repurposing car space for other uses, promoting mixed land use and densification, and encouraging citizen engagement, among others. However, most cities are in the initial stages of executing their 15mC strategies, with the majority of practices still in the planning phase. Although cities worldwide have shown considerable interest in the 15mC concept, many have yet to embark on adopting comprehensive strategies or measures aimed at achieving more radical change, notably in areas such as logistics and governance.",0965-8564,Not found

Our results reveal that purchase incentive policies are associated with increased registrations of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles, and that the effect holds over time. However, the magnitude and duration of these effects are more significant for battery electric vehicles. Ownership incentive policies do not contribute to EV registrations for either type. Further, the results suggest that policy impacts vary between countries with different levels of gross domestic product per capita and renewable energy consumption.

Our findings reveal that remote HSR stations typically function as new city subcenters. They consistently drive the expansion of both land supply and economic activities (distance effect) and draw them toward the quadrant surrounding the station (direction effect). However, the alignment between their impacts on land supply and economic activities varies based on the city characteristics. In cities experiencing population declines, remote HSR stations notably affect land supply but have a negligible influence on economic activities, leading to resource misallocation and an increased risk of ghost towns. Furthermore, better HSR accessibility and higher tertiary industry proportions can magnify the spatial spillover effects of HSR station location on both land supply and economic activities.",0965-8564,Not found
1Fixed Automated stations location and UAVs routing problems in urban road Networks: A tailored Branch-&amp;-pricing algorithm,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104201,189,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as vital tools for collecting real-time traffic data, enabling rapid responses to events, and optimizing traffic management based on their cost-effectiveness, high flexibility, and wide coverage range advantages. The urban UAV cruising problem primarily focuses on selecting the locations of fixed automated station (FAS) and optimizing UAVs’ cruising routes. This paper introduces a strategy where UAVs can take off and land on different FASs to enhance urban UAVs’ cruising efficiency. Firstly, the problem is formulated as an integrated linear integer model (FU-ILP) which simultaneously determines the locations of FASs and the routes of UAVs. The objective is to minimize redundant cruising distance and cruising cycle time. The FU-ILP model takes into account UAV‘s flight capabilities, FAS’s signal coverage range, power requirements, and battery charging. Moreover, we design a tailored branch-and-price (TB&P) algorithm to decompose the FU-ILP model, which can reduce the variable scale for solving larger-scale cases. Finally, we test the model and the algorithm on the Sioux Falls Test Network. The TB&P algorithm improves computational efficiency by nearly 80%. Moreover, our strategy yields superior results compared to the strategy where UAVs must return to their take-off FASs for recharging. We also demonstrate that increasing the number of UAVs does not reduce redundant cruising distance in the whole network, but it can shorten the cruising cycle. These policy conclusions also apply to the case of Xiongan. This provides a basis for managers to calculate the minimum UAV’s configuration based on the cities’ actual cruising frequency requirements.",0965-8564,Not found

Development of a Perceived user-specific Accessibility measure for Walking (PAW),10.1016/j.tra.2024.104203,189,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Current accessibility measures assume that all people are the same, whereas in reality there are many different user groups with different needs and perceptions. Furthermore, the concepts of walking accessibility and walkability are often analysed independently from each other. This leads to a mismatch between calculated accessibility and perceived accessibility. This paper seeks to propose a new methodological approach that considers user-specific perceptions and walkability needs when calculating pedestrian accessibility. A Perceived user-specific Accessibility measure for Walking (PAW) is developed for four sample user groups: seniors, children, women, and wheelchair users. This is done by adjusting the Geo Open Accessibility Tool (GOAT) and imputing the perceptions. Per user group, the most important walkability attributes are therefore included in the accessibility formula and weighted according to their relevance based on the literature review using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Results for a district of Munich, Germany are visualised. When juxtaposed with conventional time-based accessibility measures, our results unveil a more nuanced understanding of pedestrian infrastructure and its variabilities across different user demographics. This approach can help to provide a more realistic portrayal of pedestrian accessibility and to uncover critical gaps in current infrastructure, tailored to the needs of diverse population groups. The method can assist urban and transport planners in designing more inclusive, equitable urban environments. This contributes to a shift towards cities that are not only walkable but also attuned to the diverse needs and perceptions of their residents, ultimately enhancing quality of life and promoting equitable access to urban amenities.",0965-8564,Not found
Probing into hinterland connectivity with a web of transport modes and logistics nodes: A case of Indian container ports,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104200,189,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This article investigates the conceptual and empirical aspects of hinterland connectivity, focusing on container ports in India as a case study. It aims to clarify the complex and multidimensional nature of hinterland connectivity within the context of container ports by addressing a key conceptual issue. The study proposes that port-hinterland connectivity goes beyond direct links and emphasises the strategic relationships with key logistics centres in the hinterland. By employing centrality measures from social network analysis, the study evaluates the overall connectivity of Indian container ports, considering both direct and indirect connections from 2009 to 2021, to identify which ports have robust connections to key logistics centres. The results obtain by using eigenvector centrality reveal that an extensive hinterland network does not necessarily guarantee better hinterland connectivity for container ports. Additionally, the quality of connections, particularly to hubs with high betweenness centrality, is crucial for achieving a high degree of hinterland connectivity. These findings provide valuable policy insights, highlighting the importance of ports fostering closer relationships with key logistics hubs to effectively enhance their connectivity. Based on these findings, the paper offers policy recommendations for India aimed at improving connectivity in alignment with corresponding market shares. This research will serve as a foundation for further exploration of the interplay between port-hinterland connectivity and port market shares from a hinterland perspective, especially in a country like India, where hinterlands significantly overlap.",0965-8564,Not found
Feeder bus service design under spatially heterogeneous demand,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104214,189,2024-11-01,2024,11,"In rapidly sprawling urban areas and booming intercity express rail networks, efficiently designed feeder bus systems are more essential than ever to transport passengers to and from trunk-line rail terminals. When the feeder service region is sufficiently large, the spatial heterogeneity in demand distribution must be considered. This paper develops continuum approximation models for optimizing a heterogeneous fixed-route feeder network in a rectangular service region next to a rail terminal. Our work enhances previous studies by: (i) optimizing heterogeneous stop spacings along with line spacings and headways; (ii) accounting for passenger boarding and alighting numbers on bus dwell times and patron transfer delays at the rail terminal; and (iii) examining the advantages of asymmetric coordination between trunk and feeder schedules in both service directions. To tackle the increased modeling complexity, we introduce a semi-analytical method that combines analytically derived properties of the optimal solution with an iterative search algorithm. Local transit agencies can readily utilize this approach to design a real fixed-route feeder system. This paper reveals many findings and insights not previously reported. For instance, integrating the heterogeneous stop spacing optimization further reduces the system cost (by 4% under specific operating conditions). The cost savings increase with demand heterogeneity but decrease with the demand rate and service region size. Choosing the layout of feeder lines where buses pick up and drop off passengers along the service region’s shorter side also significantly lowers the system cost (by 6% when the service region’s aspect ratio is 1 to 2). Furthermore, coordinating trunk and feeder schedules in both service directions yields an additional cost saving of up to 20%.",0965-8564,Not found
Cycle highway effects: Assessing modal choice to cycling in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104216,189,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Cycle highways are regarded as a promising new type of infrastructure because they promote longer-distance cycling between (sub)urban residential areas and work and study centers. This study examines whether the emerging network of regional cycle highways in the Netherlands has contributed to a modal shift from car to bicycle. More specifically, we investigate the effect of these routes on commuting bicycle mode choice. Our main data sources are a national travel survey covering commuting journeys that were made between 2010 and 2021 and a comprehensive dataset we have compiled to document the exact timing and status of all cycle highways in the Netherlands. We employ a difference-in-differences approach with a binary logit model, comparing bicycle mode choice versus the car for trips that benefited from a new cycle highway, before and after the introduction of the new infrastructure, with a control group of trips that were not affected by the construction of a new route. We present results from a novel routing-based approach to measuring exposure to this new cycling facility, which allows us to establish the extent to which the fastest route to work traverses a newly constructed cycle highway. After controlling for relevant covariates, our main results indicate that the introduction of cycle highways has contributed to a shift in commuting behavior toward cycling, with an increase of approximately 10 % in cycling probability post-intervention for trips highly exposed to cycle highways. The results also indicate some heterogeneity in the effects of cycle highways across different groups of individuals. The findings of this study are especially important in the context of the Netherlands (or similar biking countries, such as Denmark). Although these countries have well-established cycling infrastructure, they can still derive benefits from new cycling routes and can support decision-makers in other countries who want to invest in cycling in the near future.",0965-8564,Not found

A survey of 480 apartment residents was undertaken in Melbourne, Australia, with results analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression modelling. Results show that households owned 0.86 bicycles on average, much higher than the current bicycle parking requirement of 0.2 spaces per household for new apartment developments. Additionally, 28% of respondents reported using a bicycle in the last week. Factors associated with bicycle ownership and use included various socio-demographics, attitudes, preferences, and built environment and transport characteristics. In general, these factors were far more extensive than previous studies that have considered all housing types together. Notably, the availability of off-street bicycle parking was found to increase the odds of an apartment household owning one bicycle, compared with none, by more than two times. The results imply that increasing bicycle ownership and use among apartment residents requires a multifaceted approach, including adequate bicycle parking requirements that vary both spatially and by apartment size, along with programs and events that can foster positive attitudes towards cycling.",0965-8564,Not found

To encourage such activities, understanding urban bikeability at both detailed and broad spatial scales is crucial. Street view imagery (SVI) offers in-depth insights into how street features influence micro-mobility patterns, but existing studies are mainly correlational. This research utilized historical time-series SVI, cyclist data from London, to discern the causal effects of specific urban features on cyclist numbers. We used propensity score matching to adjust for potential confounding biases and applied the causal forest to estimate the heterogeneity in causal effects. Key findings include: vegetation significantly boosts cycling, slope negatively impacts cycling, and bike lanes positively influence cycling. Moreover, vegetation’s impact on cycling is greater in less populated areas, while bike lanes have a stronger effect in densely populated regions. These findings help prioritize the areas of intervention. By transcending from mere correlations to identifying heterogeneous causal impacts, this study offers invaluable insights for urban planning, underscoring design strategies to enhance cities’ bikeability and sustainability.",0965-8564,Not found
Optimizing freight delivery routes: The time-distance dilemma,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104283,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Traditional approaches to optimizing freight delivery routes are based on minimizing a distance-based cost function. New approaches also use time as an objective function to minimize. However, the trade-off between time and distance is sometimes unclear. This paper presents a new approach to route optimization in which both time and distance are considered conjointly. For this purpose, the vehicle operating cost and the value of time have been used to translate time and distance into monetary units. By studying three different networks in Spain with varying levels of detail (the region of Catalonia, the city of Barcelona, and the Pamplona city center), the results show that minimizing both time and distance yield better results than the traditional approach, especially at a local level, where congestion effects are more relevant. These findings are helpful for logistics companies to optimize their operations, as well as for public authorities who could employ these models to make decisions and create policies on logistics.",0965-8564,Not found
Pursuing the impossible (?) dream: Incorporating attitudes into practice-ready travel demand forecasting models,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104254,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Despite the fact that our existing models are not up to the job of predicting travel behavior in today’s rapidly changing landscape, and despite considerable evidence that attitudes help us explain behavior more completely and more meaningfully, attitudes are nowhere to be found in practice-oriented travel demand forecasting models. Two main objections have been raised to their inclusion: they are too cumbersome to measure, and difficult-if-not-impossible to forecast. This paper reports on the considerable progress that has been made toward overcoming the first objection, through the use of machine learning methods to train a prediction function on smaller-scale research-oriented survey datasets, and then applying that function to impute attitudes into large-scale household travel survey datasets. Internal evaluations show that we can estimate attitudinal factor scores with moderate fidelity when using socioeconomic/demographic, land use, and targeted marketing variables, and with high fidelity when using just a few attitudinal marker variables. External evaluations demonstrate that the imputed attitudes lead to improved behavioral insight and predictive ability for forecasting-oriented models. With respect to the second objection I have only sketched some ideas for moving forward, but there are clearly some practical steps that could be taken at very little marginal cost, such as including as few as 10 attitudinal marker statements in future household travel surveys.",0965-8564,Not found
Demand for green and fossil fuel automobiles,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104284,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Net-zero policy targets will require a transition from conventional vehicles (CVs) to greener alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). This paper examines what influences the demand for AFVs and CVs in the UK’s large automobile market, looking at vehicle attributes, prices, and other factors, such as brands, country of origin, car segments, and vehicle equipment. Using an extensive, unique dataset covering the period 2008–2019, we compute own-price, cross-price, and demand elasticities for CVs and AFVs. Applying a random-coefficient discrete-choice model of demand, and controlling for consumer heterogeneity, unobserved product characteristics, and price endogeneity, we find that the key drivers of demand are prices, fuel consumption, and vehicle size, with similar demand sensitivity between CVs and AFVs. Demand falls by 3%–5% for a ₤1,000 increase in price for both CVs and AFVs, conditional on the quality and availability of substitutes. This indicates that UK consumers are not willing to pay a price premium for AFVs, suggesting little value placed on the “greenness” of AFVs. We estimate that a ₤1,000 subsidy to AFV purchases would lead to 4% of consumers switching to the greener vehicles. While CVs and AFVs exhibit similar price elasticities, vehicle size affects AFV demand by about 40% more, as their purchasers value smaller sized vehicles. Our results indicate that without financial incentives, the uptake of AFVs may remain low, as the higher cost and lower convenience outweighs the environmental considerations for the majority of consumers.",0965-8564,Not found
"Mapping the interplay of work-arrangement, residential location, and activity engagement within an integrated model",10.1016/j.tra.2024.104294,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Virtual activities, such as teleworking have been identified as major travel demand management strategies to tackle traffic congestion and emission. However, integrated models, which are capable of testing such strategies, have not yet been properly extended to capture emerging activity patterns. This study fills-up the literature gap by implementing individuals’ work-arrangement and introducing in-home (IH) virtual activities within an integrated Transport, Land-use, and Emission (iTLE) modeling framework. First, it conducts a household travel survey, which collected socio-economic, activity-travel, and work-related information through a questionnaire survey in the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), Nova Scotia, Canada. Next, it develops a work-arrangement choice model based on the mixed-logit modelling (MXL) approach and implements it within iTLE. After that, individuals’ daily activity programs are generated in a sequential manner utilizing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modelling approach considering their work-arrangement, employment, and vehicle ownership. To demonstrate the application of the developed tool, individuals’ socio-demographics, residential-location, work-location, and activity-participation are longitudinally simulated up to 2031. The analysis of teleworking parameters revealed distinct clusters and individual preferences, emphasizing the significance of personalized approaches in formulating teleworking strategies. Most non-teleworkers stay closer to downtown than full-teleworkers while clustered behavior is observed among hybrid workers for residential location choice. Increase is observed for shopping, dining-out, and IH maintenance/discretionary activities while decrease is observed for out-of-home work.

Choosing a flat rate over a pay-per-use tariff for public transport: Do psychological factors matter?,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104247,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"We investigate the relationship between various psychological factors (taximeter effect, flexibility effect, cost control effect, pre-commitment effect), annual distance traveled, and public transport tariff preferences (pay-per-use vs. flat rate). While a pay-per-use tariff entails ticket prices depending on usage intensity, a flat rate involves an annual public transport subscription covering all journeys within a year. Drawing from a sample of 3,381 Swiss public transport customers utilizing either the pay-per-use option or holding a flat-rate subscription, a binomial logistic regression highlights that the number of passenger kilometers traveled (pkm) predominantly influences the choice of a flat rate. However, the examined psychological factors also significantly shape decision-making. Notably, these effects vary based on the quantity of the product consumed. Specifically, both the taximeter and cost-control effects tend to increase with pkm. Conducting a simulation using binomial logistic regression, we illustrate how different psychological factors are related to the likelihood of opting for a flat-rate subscription. The findings suggest that the level of importance of the psychological factors are relevant to predict the odds of selecting a flat-rate subscription. Hence, emphasizing product advantages in marketing communications and strategically adjusting product design to leverage these psychological factors emerge as effective strategies for enhancing sales promotion and fostering customer loyalty. These results offer insights into consumer psychology and decision-making within the transportation sector. The implications are particularly valuable for managers aiming to address barriers to public transport use.

Quantitative analysis of the relationships between dockless bike sharing and public transport: A trip-level perspective,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104277,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The widespread expansion of dockless bike sharing (DBS) services has had non-negligible effects on public transport systems by establishing intricate connections with public transport modes, such as metro and bus. An accurate understanding of the intricate relationships between DBS and public transport is crucial for promoting synergistic operations and maximizing the benefits. This study presents a novel quantitative analysis methodology from a trip-level perspective based on multi-source data to explore the relationships between dockless bike sharing and public transport without reliance on geospatial thresholds. By utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing bike sharing service operations, public transit facilities, and optimal route choices, we introduce the concepts of degree of site proximity (DSP) and degree of trip substitution (DTS), which are designed to assess the opportunities for cooperation and competition in DBS trips. Clustering techniques categorize recorded trips into specific types: competition, cooperation, cooperation-competition, and independence. A survey of dockless bike sharing users in Shanghai, China was conducted to obtain data on usage of DBS and the alternative choices without DBS. A comparison between the survey results and the estimates from the proposed methodology validates its effectiveness. In-depth analyses of factors such as weekends, cycling distances, and station densities reveal patterns of variation in the relationship between DBS and public transport systems. These findings provide valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers to enhance the integration of DBS and public transport systems, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of urban transportation networks.",0965-8564,Not found
Modelling COVID-19 travel rebound with automated land use identification,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104280,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"As movement restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic forced urban workforces around the world to temporarily adopt telecommuting or flexible working arrangements, some speculate that these practices could remain as the ‘future-of-work’. Therefore, transportation and urban planners would both need to react to new post-pandemic work-based travel patterns. Unlike most common methods of analysing post-COVID telecommuting trends that rely on survey responses, this study develops a two-stage methodology of automatic land use identification (ALI) and mixed effects regression for the synthesis of both land use and transportation data with the aim of monitoring the post-pandemic travel recovery situation. Firstly, clustering methods are used for ALI around public transport destinations to generate different classes of regions based on land use characteristic. Mixed effects regression is then conducted to estimate the variability between different classes of regions. To gain insights on the travel rebound in Singapore, the case study focuses on business entity locations and bus transit volumes during the peak hours.

Evaluating the impact of automated vehicles on residential location distribution using activity-based accessibility: A case study of Japanese regional areas,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104281,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Automated Vehicles (AVs) are expected to disrupt the transport sector in the future. Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to studying its potential implications. However, the existing literature is yet limited regarding long-term impacts. To fill this gap, this paper estimates and validates a residential location choice model to evaluate the impacts of AVs on residential location distribution in the context of Japanese regional areas. Activity-based accessibility, a utility-based accessibility measure, is used to reflect the AV impacts on short-term travel demand. The year 2040 is set as the backdrop for the analyses, where the effects of the decreased population are reflected in the scenario settings, along with variables such as decreased travel impedance to accommodate the uncertainties in the characteristics of AVs. The simulation results of four AV scenarios confirm the potential of urban expansion. The results demonstrate that, compared to the Base Scenario, the median distances between the residences and the closest Dwelling Attraction Areas, representing as the target for attracting residences by the local government, expand by 5.2% to 10.2% for the AV scenarios. Two hypothetical policy mandates are then applied to alleviate the problem. The results indicate that providing a 10% subsidy to the land price might be effective to mitigate urban sprawl for the scenario with relatively conservative AV settings. Nonetheless, the substantial cost associated with implementing such a policy renders it effectively unfeasible and underscores the need for proactive planning in anticipation of a level 4 or 5 Automated Vehicle future.",0965-8564,Not found
A novel data-driven approach for customizing destination choice set: A case study in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104278,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Modeling the destination choice has been of great interest for travel behavior community as well as policymakers in understanding the demand for land use and transportation infrastructures at aggregate and disaggregate levels and possibly devising policies to balance the demand and supplies. One of the challenges underlying predictions of location choice is the large choice set. While traditionally many methods had been devised to limit the choice set size either on a rather ad hoc basis or based on space–time prism by removing the locations out of reach of the subjects, the current study takes a substantially different approach and proposes a data-driven method to customize the generation of the choice set. The proposition is that observing the mobility patterns of citizens for multiple weeks would enable us to limit the choice set, depending on how far the subjects travel (beyond or within the distance they travel for their most frequent activities) to conduct their various activities. More precisely, using longitudinal trajectory data, we first classify people into two subgroups: returners and explorers, based on the size of the area (around their k most visited locations: k-radius of gyration) they move during the observation period. The destination choice set for four types of activities is then customized for returners (and explorers) and is used in a sequence of decisions represented by decision trees for the prediction of their destinations. The models for the whole sample and each subgroup separately are compared. The results suggest that the accuracy of destination prediction improves substantially for all four selected activity types, especially for the returners whose choice sets are formed based on their radius of gyration.",0965-8564,Not found
Modelling the complementarity and flexibility between different shared modes available in smart electric mobility hubs (eHUBS),10.1016/j.tra.2024.104279,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"eHUBS are physical locations that integrate two or more electric shared mobility modes. As they provide transport users easier access to a wide range of transport modes, multimodal behaviour is expected to be more common. However, this issue has not been addressed in previous stated preference studies on mode choices involving innovative transport modes. In this study, multimodal behaviour is explicitly addressed both in measurement and in modelling by adopting the multiple discrete–continuous (MDC) modelling framework in contrast to discrete choice models. Instead of asking transport users to indicate the most preferred alternative, they were allowed to choose more than one alternative by allocating trips between several modes. This study aims to answer two questions: 1) whether there is complementarity between the multiple shared modes offered in eHUBS and 2) how would transport users adapt when one of the shared modes that they plan to use becomes unavailable. Using stated mode choice data of non-commuting trips from transport users whose current mode is driving a private car in Manchester, UK, several models under the MDC framework were estimated including Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) model, mixed MDCEV model, and the extended Multiple Discrete Continuous (eMDC) model. The results show that there is complementarity between shared electric vehicle (EV) and electric bike (e-bike) offered in the eHUBS. In addition, the research show that the flexibility between those two shared modes is stronger than assumed in the MDCEV model, and common preference heterogeneity cannot fully account for this phenomenon.",0965-8564,Not found

We propose a novel origin-based nested logit model of airport demand based on a comprehensive utility function—denoted as con-accessibility—integrating advanced metrics of ground accessibility and airport connectivity. To address the lack of extensive pairwise municipality–airport data, we cast the estimation problem as a nonlinear constrained least-squares optimization problem, solved via a differential evolution algorithm. The framework’s applicability and insights are demonstrated in a real-world case study of the latest Italian national airport system plan. We highlight the model’s capability in addressing three key policy questions: (i) characterizing airport catchments toward investigating the degree of overlap and airport interactions in serving contended areas; (ii) systematically quantifying the overall level of con-accessibility in any region to assess deficits or surpluses and pinpoint areas for strategic interventions; (iii) supporting the assessment and prioritization of various initiatives, including the upgrade of ground access networks, the expansion of airport supply, and the establishment of new airport facilities.",0965-8564,Not found
A dynamic discrete choice modelling approach for forward-looking travel mode choices,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104272,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"In this paper, we present a systematic approach based on dynamic discrete choice models (DDCM) to investigate individuals’ forward-looking mode choice behaviours in daily travel tours with multiple destinations. We propose a novel network transformation model that encompasses the entire decision space of all feasible mode combinations for every observed trip/tour in the dataset. By applying the well-established Recursive Logit model structure commonly used in path choice modelling, we address the tour mode choice problem effectively and quantify forward looking considerations in the mode choice process. The proposed model captures the complex considerations individuals take into account when making mode choices. The network transformation incorporates downstream mode limitations into the preceding mode choice options, enabling us to model individuals’ forward-looking behaviour and gain insights into how considerations of future trips such as a shopping in the evening, or school pick-up trip influence previous mode choice decisions earlier in the day. Uncovering and quantifying these hidden forward-looking factors can help modellers better explain the private car usage usually observed for the entire sequences of daily trips, even in presence of competitive alternative modes. The proposed network transformation also enables us to measure the effect of the requirement/preference to return private vehicles (car, motorcycle, and bicycle) home on mode choices in home-bound trips, and subsequently, on the entire daily mode choice decisions. To validate the proposed model, we utilise the VISTA household travel survey data from the Melbourne Metropolitan area in Australia. The model is compared against baseline models, demonstrating its statistical advantages. Additionally, intuitive illustrations using the data showcase the model’s efficacy. From transport planning and policy perspective, tour-based mode choice modelling provides a more comprehensive and precise understanding of travel behaviour by considering the sequence of trips made by an individual. This can help capture the interactions and dependencies between different trips, which trip-based models may overlook. The proposed model is more suitable for analysing the effects of policy interventions like congestion pricing, public transport investments, or new mobility initiatives, as they can better represent the cascading effects of such policies across multiple trips.",0965-8564,Not found

Meanwhile, HSR and AT operations have different impacts on various classes of cities, and the impacts of HSR and AT operation levels on the TD is positive. The obtained results imply that when seizing the development opportunities of HSR and AT to promote TD, administrators should implement different strategies according to local conditions and the current status of TD.",0965-8564,Not found
Do ride-hailing congestion fees in NYC work?,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104274,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"What is the impact of congestion policies targeting ride-hailing systems? This work empirically evaluates NYC’s congestion surcharge policy, particularly in light of the city’s forthcoming implementation of congestion pricing. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework, our analysis reveals a statistically significant reduction of approximately 11% in overall ride-hailing travel volume following the implementation of the policy. In particular, Lyft experienced a 17% reduction in travel demand while Uber and yellow-cabs experienced reductions of about 9% and 8% respectively. We further elucidate two key mechanisms — travel distance and subway station availability — to explain this reduction. The surcharge policy has a more pronounced impact on shorter trips (with the most significant decline observed in trips less than one mile), and on ride-hailing trips originating from areas with at least one substitute (such as subway or Citi Bike). Furthermore,the policy’s effect seems more pronounced in lower-income areas of the city and seems to reduce street-hailing industry revenues by 8%. However, despite these reductions, the policy does not result in a corresponding decrease in traffic congestion. Thus, it seems that the policy results in a net welfare loss for the city, at least in the shorter term. Our findings provide insights for understanding the dynamics of congestion policies focused on the ride-hailing industry, especially as New York City prepares to introduce congestion pricing.",0965-8564,Not found
Influence of telecommuting on out-of-home time use and diversity of locations visited: Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104276,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unforeseen changes in travel and activity behavior, most notably the wide adoption of telecommuting across various sectors of the workforce. This paper investigates the impact of telecommuting on time use and the number of unique locations visited, both of which have been shown to be closely linked to well-being. Previous telecommuting research often relies on cross-sectional data for which it is difficult to control for unobserved confounding, only analyzes impacts of time-use at the daily level, and has yet to quantify the impact of telecommuting on diversity of locations visited. We use quasi-experimental designs to control for unobserved confounders and extend previous research to identify whether the daily impacts of telecommuting on time-use are additive or substitutional at the weekly level. We use passively collected Point of Interest (POI) data between January 2020 and September 2022, supplemented by five waves of survey responses throughout the COVID-19 pandemic (August 2020, October 2020, December 2020, April 2021, and July 2021) from a panel of U.S. smartphone users. We find that on telecommuting days, workers spend significantly more time at out-of-home non-work locations, estimated to be 114 min prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing in the early stages of the pandemic to 63 min, and recovering to approximately 120 min in 2022, estimates that are within the range of estimates presented in previous literature. While existing literature focuses on single day analyses, our weekly analysis suggests that daily differences due to telecommuting are substitutional, with the effect of an additional day of telecommuting on time-use at the weekly level being null. Our extension to analyze the impacts of telecommuting on the number of unique locations visited shows that an additional day of telecommuting results in an average decrease of 0.35 in the number of unique weekly locations visited. Collectively, our findings suggest that while telecommuting does not diminish the overall weekly time spent at out-of-home non-work locations, it decreases the diversity of such locations on a weekly level.",0965-8564,Not found
Investigating how consumption values and place identity shape long-haul truck drivers’ intention to visit roadside rest areas,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104265,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Transportation business organisations, policymakers, and government entities attempt to enhance the welfare of long-haul truck drivers (LHTDs) by promoting safe driving practices. LHTDs spend long hours on goods delivery journeys, and that causes various health and in-route safety issues for drivers. For improved LHTD health and safety, many developed nations introduced the concept of roadside rest areas (RRAs) for regulated, safe, and enhanced driving experience for LHTDs, whereas developing nations’ research on RRAs development is nascent. The RRAs offer a chance to reduce negative truck driving impacts and promote wellbeing among LHTDs, but why drivers will visit RRAs during their tracking journey is a question for policymakers. Hence, the present study tries to comprehend the significance of drivers’ visit consumption values in terms of functional, social, emotional, epistemic, conditional value, and place identity concerning visit intentions towards RRAs. In addition, the present work examines the influence of consumption values on word of mouth (WoM) for RRAs by LHTDs. The research problem is examined via the lens of the theory of consumption values. The study utilised 247 valid responses for model analysis, using the partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. The findings establish that consumption value is a formative construct that further positively influences place identity, intentions to visit RRAs, and WoM for RRAs by LHTDs. This implies that the intentions of LHTDs to visit relaxation sites are mostly influenced by the values they perceive from such places. This perception of consumption values also helps LHTDs develop place identity with RRAs and influences them to spread positive WoM about it. However, the results of the present study did not find the mediation role of place identity. This implies that Indian LHTDs will develop the intention to visit RRAs because of the consumption values rather than any attachment to the place. The findings of this paper will help transport policymakers develop adequate measures for developing rest areas on major transport routes to improve road safety and drivers’ wellbeing.",0965-8564,Not found
Influence factors on travel mode preference of working residents living far away from downtown area on workdays: A hybrid method integrating random parameter logit model and Apriori algorithm,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104275,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This study presents a detailed analysis on the characteristics of travel mode preference of working residents living far away from downtown area on workdays, using GPS-based activity travel diary data from Shangdi area (Beijing). A hybrid method integrating random parameter logit model with systematic heterogeneity (RPL-SH) and Apriori algorithm is put forward to explore the influence factors and interaction effects affecting travel mode preference. First, the RPL-SH model is established to explore significant factors, and capture the unobserved random heterogeneity and systematic heterogeneity due to individual characteristics on the travel mode preference. Then, these significant factors are used to generate association rules by Apriori algorithm to investigate statistical associations between the specific travel mode preference and these significant factors. Ten significant factors are found in the RPL-SH model, in which annual household income is normally distributed. The results of the Apriori algorithm indicate that some factors combined with other factors could significantly influence working residents’ travel mode preference. For example, the combination of lower annual household income and shorter distance between workplace and the nearest bus stop is highly associated with green travel mode preference. Moreover, the results show that the proposed hybrid method not only demonstrates the consistency of the results of the two methods, but also plays a complementary role in exploring more information on travel mode preference. This research hopes to give regulators a better understanding on how working residents living far away from downtown area choose their travel mode, so as to develop more effective and targeted measures for reducing private car use and alleviating workday traffic congestion.",0965-8564,Not found
"Perceived accessibility and self-rated health: Examining subjective well-being in the suburbs of Scarborough, Canada",10.1016/j.tra.2024.104261,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Addressing inadequate accessibility in suburban areas is crucial for reducing inequalities in transportation and improving suburbanites’ well-being. Afterall, insufficient accessibility to health is linked to worse health conditions. Moreover, urban sprawl, subpar transit, and automobile dependency prevail in suburbs, making them loci of inequalities in accessibility and, consequently, of potential worse health outcomes for residents. Due to their predictive capacity, subjective health indicators have been extensively researched. Knowledge on Self-Rated Health’s (SRH) link to accessibility in suburbs, however, is incomplete because the field seldom considers individuals’ perceptions. This article examines the association between accessibility and SRH in suburban areas. Using ordinal logistic regressions and data from a survey in Scarborough, Canada, we investigate if accessibility measures estimated from land-use and transportation network data (estimated measures), perceived accessibility, and perceptions of the built environment are associated with SRH. We explore these connections with different domains of SRH (mental, physical and overall). We find that living in areas with higher estimated accessibility measures is positively correlated with better SRH, whereas unsatisfactory perceived accessibility is negatively associated. Additionally, suburbanites who prioritize access to healthcare nearby have lower odds of having better health, meaning that residents who would like to see healthcare access improve are more likely to have worst SRH. Estimated measures are positively associated with self-rated mental health, while reporting difficulty in paying for transport is negatively associated with physical health. These findings stress how multiple components of accessibility – from estimated to perceived measures– can be associated with people’s well-being. Results illuminate the relevance of considering perceptions, often overlooked, in accessibility and health analysis. Finally, the results put into question if suburbanites’ heterogenous needs are recognized in urban design in a context of recent suburbanization of poverty.",0965-8564,Not found

However, the patterns will vary by department (HR/legal/sales/IT, etc.) and by sector of operations. Top three concerns among employers include: supervision and mentoring, reduction in innovation, and creativity; and the top three benefits include their ability to retain / recruit talent, positive impact on public image and their ability to compete. An Ordered Probit model of the expected April 2024 work location strategy revealed that those in transportation, warehousing, and manufacturing sectors, those with a fully in-person approach to work pre-COVID, and those with a negative outlook towards the impact of remote work are likely to be more in-person-centered, while those with fully remote work approach in April 2020 are likely to be less in-person-centered.

Who is ready to live a car-independent lifestyle? A latent class cluster analysis of attitudes towards car ownership and usage,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104271,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"An excessive use of private cars for transportation has multiple negative effects on our society. It is therefore paramount to identify the underlying factors driving car usage among different segments of travellers. In this study, we aim to identify and characterise traveller segments in terms of their car-related attitudes and how different sociodemographic attributes, travel behaviour characteristics (such as using cars as the primary mode of transportation), and the accessibility of their place of residence vary amongst different population segments. Through Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Latent Profile Analysis we identify five different classes, namely car-detractors, −hesitants, −positives, −friends, and −lovers. More favourable car attitudes are associated with higher car ownership and access but, interestingly, there are no significant differences in terms of travel frequency and trip length distribution. This suggests that attitudinal differences relate mostly to modal preference rather than to the underlying travel demand patterns and the associated activities. We also see that car-less individuals are more likely to be car detractors, suggesting that the experiencing barriers for owning a car may contribute to developing more negative attitudes towards cars. Our results shed light on the different influencing factors and characteristics of individuals that consider, or not, a car-centred mobility.",0965-8564,Not found
A strategic variable fee for business-to-consumer carriers: A case study in Barcelona,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104233,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Directive 2022/362 of the European Parliament and the Council offers fundamental guidelines that enable public administrations to implement road user charges, thereby internalizing the environmental costs associated with road transport. This directive also grants Member States a degree of flexibility to pursue their distinct strategies, making the analysis of various measures and their impact interesting for both cities and other stakeholders. Thus, this paper proposes a variable charge per hour for each stop made in the loading and unloading (L/U) zones by vehicles involved in direct delivery of products from businesses to consumers (B2C). The aim is to mitigate congestion and pollution during peak hours while reducing the movement of freight vehicles within the inner city. This charge functions as an economic policy tool to redirect inefficient B2C distribution towards sustainable distribution models, precisely in line with cities’ objectives. The proposed variable charge is evaluated for the cities of London, Milan, Stockholm, and New York, and compared with their current (or planned) pricing schemes. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of the variable charge’s application in the case of Barcelona is conducted. This analysis encompasses considerations not only related to urban congestion, transport, and environmental costs (CO2, NOx, and PM2.5 emissions), but also the financial implications for the stakeholders involved in this activity. The results of the charge implementation indicate that the measure presented in this paper can reduce transportation costs, alleviate congestion, and lower CO2 emissions.",0965-8564,Not found
Residential self-selection and the relative importance of travel considerations in the residential choice of a car-reduced neighbourhood,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104266,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Car-reduced neighbourhoods are an urban planning tool to limit the increase in motorised traffic due to urban growth by making car ownership and use less attractive for the inhabitants. Since car-reduced living appeals more to some people than others, car-reduced neighbourhoods may be subject to residential self-selection (RSS). RSS indicates that individuals choose residential areas that support pre-existing travel attitudes and preferences, and, in consequence, that their travel behaviour is not solely the result of the built environment. Many studies on RSS operationalise self-selection effects using travel-related attitudes. In contrast, we assume that travel considerations in residential location choice (TCRC) are more precise for this purpose. While attitude refers to a mental state towards a travel mode, e.g. a personal affection for cycling, TCRC describes an actual desire to live in an area with, for example, street layouts that facilitate cycling. Drawing on a sample of 339 recently relocated inhabitants of a car-reduced neighbourhood in Darmstadt, Germany, we first identify the importance of TCRC in choosing this neighbourhood relative to other residential considerations. We find that TCRC have less influence compared to factors such as house size and price. However, a comparison of individuals with low and high car orientation reveals that the former prioritise car-reduced designs more when selecting a neighbourhood. Second, we find that new residents’ car use decreases after relocating, while carsharing use increases. Third, we find no significant difference between attitudes and TCRC when measuring RSS in our behaviour change models. In terms of policy implications, the further development of car-reduced neighbourhoods will (i) trigger an increase in the use of sustainable modes among new residents and (ii) make it easier for people who already rarely drive to maintain their car independence.",0965-8564,Not found

The research shows that affordable housing residents are in a more disadvantaged position than commercial housing residents based on their perceived accessibility, housing and transport equity evaluation results are all worse than those of commercial housing residents. Therefore, two SEM models were constructed to understand the underlying factors driving these perceptions. The results show that both housing location and transport provision significantly affect perceived accessibility, housing and transport equity. Improving people’s transport affordability is the most effective way to improve perceived accessibility, and transport equity for both groups, however, improving the housing environment is more critical for affordable housing residents, while improving housing affordability is more important for commercial housing residents.",0965-8564,Not found
Multi-disruption resilient hub location–allocation network design for less-than-truckload logistics,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104260,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Less-than-truckload (LTL) logistics presents an interesting and often overlooked practice area of hub location–allocation problems, with its variable discount rates playing a game-changing role. Vulnerability of the roads is another critical factor that has often been neglected when designing hub networks. In this paper, a novel integrated model is designed to solve the LTL hub network design problem, incorporating a practical stepwise discount function. The proposed model is further extended to a reliability-oriented version that can resiliently withstand multiple, simultaneous road disruptions. We use the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) technique to encompass the likelihood of experiencing each failure mode, together with the monetary and service-level effects. Coupled with probability theory, it leads to the introduction of a novel closed form for serviceability under multiple concurrent failures. Having such a function enables us to deploy exact optimization methods. Given the natural complexity of the problem, we also present effective linearization approaches. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the novel reliability-oriented approach over the basic version, successfully realizing desired serviceability levels as high as 80%. It also benefits from avoiding unnecessary rerouting, making it even more attractive for policymakers to design efficiently resilient transportation networks, especially if low-range, zero-emission trucks are incorporated.",0965-8564,Not found
A household-based online cooked meal delivery demand generation model,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104262,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Online cooked meal deliveries (CMD) have become prevalent with the advancement of on-demand delivery services offered by vendors such as Uber Eats and DoorDash.

The model serves as a strategic tool for CMD vendors to address consumer needs. At the same time, it also holds substantial relevance for policymakers seeking to understand CMD demand and formulate effective regulatory measures for CMD operations. This paper presents such a modelling framework. The model is developed under the behavioural principle of random utility maximization (RUM) and explicitly represents various socioeconomic characteristics in the CMD demand generation process. The model is estimated using a Greater Toronto Area, Canada dataset. The empirical model provides insights into the factors influencing week-long CMD usage.

A mass evacuation modeling framework to account for vulnerabilities in staged evacuation,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104245,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This study develops a framework for mass evacuation modeling that considers staged evacuation in response to an impending hurricane for testing and evaluation. The study follows two-stage modeling processes: (1) developing a fuzzy logic-based staged evacuation model that informs staged evacuation scenario building process, and (2) developing a traffic microsimulation model to test and evaluate staged evacuation scenarios. The staged evacuation model ascertains a vulnerability-based zonal prioritization while accounting for geophysical, social, and mobility challenges utilizing the vulnerability-index. Simulation results suggest that average travel time in staged evacuation decreases by 39.5% compared to evacuation without any countermeasure applied. The staged evacuation process demonstrates a decrease of 0.3–4.8 h in clearance time for most zones. The application of vulnerability-index for prioritization enables an efficient evacuation of high-risk areas. For example, Downtown-district is prioritized due to high vulnerability-index yielding a 2.8-hour decrease in clearance time for 50% of downtown-zones.

"The effects of planned behaviour, spatiotemporal variables and lifestyle on public transport use: An exploratory study",10.1016/j.tra.2024.104255,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Previous studies with discretionary activities as the context have shown that psychological constructs (volition, desire and past behaviour) are time- and space-invariant. However, discretionary activities are less routine than people’s daily travel patterns (e.g. travel mode usage), which may result in inconsistent results among studies. The present study thus aimed to investigate the effects of temporal, social and spatial variations on the psychological mechanisms underlying more routine activity patterns such as the usage of public transport. This study was expanded to incorporate lifestyle mechanisms to determine the effects of consumption patterns on public transport. In contrast with previous studies using less routine activity patterns, on a routine basis, people’s motivation, volition and past behaviour tended to be time- and space-invariant. Indeed, the perceived ability to engage in activities was not completely predictive of behaviour; however, some spatiotemporal variables, such as mandatory and leisure activity patterns, could predict those with linear patterns of past behaviour, behaviour volition and actual behaviour. Built-environment variables (e.g. residing in areas with higher population density and being near the city centre) tend to shape public transport usage. However, shaping the built environment and having the commitment and intention to use public transport is not likely enough to shift people to use public transport. Making people loyal to public transport and focusing on those who have less commitment to perform mandatory and in-home discretionary activities are two variables that tend to shape high public transport usage.",0965-8564,Not found
Working from home and commuter travel in germany – panel data analysis of long-term effects,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104257,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Working from home (WFH) is expected to be part of the ‘new normal’ in a post-pandemic future.

This oversight underscores the necessity for a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic interplay between social, including travel behaviors, and technical infrastructure components within transportation systems. This article delves into the impact of “social shocks” on transportation systems, which are defined as disturbances affecting the social subsystem without yet affecting the technical subsystem. Drawing inspiration from C.S. Holling’s ecological resilience, which signifies a system’s ability to cope with change by adapting its structure and functionality, we propose a multi-level resilience assessment framework. It encompasses four mobility-related indicators: entropy (measuring network-level complexity), stationarity (assessing community compositional changes at the cluster level), and two node-level metrics — within-module degree and weighted participation coefficient — capturing location connectivity. These indicators proxy for evaluating the mobility structure and node functionality within the social subsystem. In a case study, we analyze historical smart card data to examine the mobility pattern’s structural changes within Hong Kong, a rail-oriented metropolis, during a prolonged and city-wide protest. The framework and associated indicators provide an alternative perspective for transit planners and operators, allowing them to assess both the overall system and individual stations, moving beyond traditional assessments of service supply and patronage changes.",0965-8564,Not found
Welfare implications of a mixed ownership-operations structure of high-speed train,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104238,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"In most European and Asian countries, the owner of the high-speed train (HST) track is either fully independent from, or integrated with, the operations of train service. In this paper, we build a simple model to analyze a particularly unique ownership structure of HST infrastructure, namely, a mixed structure featuring both integration and separation within a network. We compare this mixed case with the scenario where ownership and operations of HST are integrated and identify a conflict between social welfare (consumer surplus) and HST profit. Specifically, consumer surplus and social welfare are higher in the mixed case (compared with the integrated case), while the profit of the HST industry is lower if any of the following conditions holds: 1) the size of the market, where ownership and operations may be separated, is sufficiently small; 2) the weight that the HST operator puts on social welfare is sufficiently small; 3) the fee paid by the infrastructure owner to HST operator for operational services is sufficiently high. Our results prove to be robust when there exists competition from airlines. Additionally, we observe consistent outcomes when varying the weights on social welfare.

In practice, most research has focused on simple measures of proximity that, while easy to understand, fail to capture the potential for interaction using the transit network. Through the example of the King Street Transit Priority Corridor project, this research examines how transit accessibility, and changes in access over time that result from streetcar service upgrades, are capitalized into condominium prices in Toronto, Canada. Methodological and applied contributions include calculating streetcar travel time differences using disaggregate vehicle tracking data, calculating transit accessibility using a gravity-based measure with a calibrated impedance function, accounting for variations in accessibility over the course of a day as well as changes over time, incorporating measures of access to local amenities, transforming 2D transaction information to a 3D format, and specifying 4D spatio-temporal weights. Longitudinal model results indicate that transit accessibility is a significant determinant of condominium prices. While the service upgrades did not dramatically increase accessibility levels and the implicit value of accessibility did not change over time, panel model results find that condominium property prices appreciated by about 2.7% more on average in the King Street streetcar corridor relative to the Sheppard subway control after the introduction of the priority corridor pilot.

Putting Automobile Debt on the Map: Race and the Geography of Automobile Debt in California,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104230,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Most U.S. metropolitan areas developed alongside the automobile, producing neighborhoods of relatively low density. Consequently, access to opportunities in these neighborhoods is predicated on having an automobile, yet many households do not have the resources to purchase one outright, relying on automobile loans to spread out the purchase price. While automobile loans can enable automobile ownership, they also significantly increase the vehicle purchase price, particularly for non-white consumers subject to discriminatory lending practices. In this study, we rely on data from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel from Experian to examine the determinants and geography of automobile debt and its consequences in California, testing whether various automobile debt measures disproportionately affect non-white neighborhoods. We find that, controlling for other factors associated with automobile lending including income, Black and Latino/a neighborhoods have higher total automobile debt, debt burdens (debt relative to income), and automobile loan delinquency rates. In particular, Latino/a neighborhoods shoulder significant automobile debt, while borrowers in Black neighborhoods have the highest delinquency rates. Factors associated with lower total automobile debt and automobile debt burden include better credit ratings, higher residential densities, urban locations, and proximity to rail stations. The findings underscore the importance of policies to offset the costs of automobile ownership and access. As part of this, policymakers should adopt and enforce fair lending rules to combat discriminatory and predatory practices and facilitate access to high-quality financial institutions and products in communities of color.",0965-8564,Not found
Analysis of car sharing operation area performance: An idle time prediction approach,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104241,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Free-floating car sharing (FFCS) extends traditional station-based services by providing a more flexible car sharing alternative for users. However, the increased user flexibility introduces challenges from an operator perspective. To make services profitable, the total idle time of vehicles needs to be minimised and available vehicles should be located where demand exists. To increase profitability, it is important to carefully choose the operational area based on the expected idle time that different locations may offer, and only strategically expand into areas where the sustainability of the service can be maintained. In this paper, we present a hazard-based duration model for the idle times of a car sharing vehicle service. It is argued that modelling of idle time as opposed to bookings, which is the common approach, allows to circumvent the problem of latent demand and thereby presents itself as a simpler modelling strategy. In the paper, the model is applied to the city of Copenhagen, where we study the operational performance on the basis of 327,610 electric free-floating car trips in the period 2017-2018. We study the performance over 92 existing zones and predict the expected performance for an additional 28 zones by considering geographical and socio-economic drivers of demand. This enables the prediction of which areas to include as part of an expansion of the operational area, and thus serves the purpose of a strategic planning tool for growing such services. It is found that the additional zones differ substantially in their performance, which is a consequence of zones being more or less aligned with the local FFCS drivers of demand. This leads to a prioritisation of zones for further expansion based on performance, where the idle time of the best performing zones is seen to be as much as one hour less than the worst performing zones.",0965-8564,Not found
Situational-aware multi-graph convolutional recurrent network (SA-MGCRN) for travel demand forecasting during wildfires,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104242,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Natural hazards, such as wildfires, pose a significant threat to communities worldwide. Real-time forecasting of travel demand during wildfire evacuations is crucial for emergency managers and transportation planners to make timely and better-informed decisions. However, few studies focus on accurate travel demand forecasting in large-scale emergency evacuations. To tackle this research gap, the study develops a new methodological framework for modeling highly granular spatiotemporal trip generation in wildfire evacuations by using (a) large-scale GPS data generated by mobile devices and (b) state-of-the-art AI technologies. Based on the travel demand inferred from the GPS data, we develop a new deep learning model, i.e., Situational-Aware Multi-Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (SA-MGCRN), along with a model updating scheme to achieve real-time forecasting of travel demand during wildfire evacuations. The proposed methodological framework is tested using a real-world case study: the 2019 Kincade Fire in Sonoma County, CA. The results show that SA-MGCRN significantly outperforms all the selected state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of prediction performance. Our finding suggests that the most important model components of SA-MGCRN are weekend indicator, population change, evacuation order/warning information, and proximity to fire, which are consistent with behavioral theories and empirical findings. SA-MGCRN can be directly used in future wildfire events to assist real-time decision-making and emergency management.",0965-8564,Not found
Investigating the role of flex-time working arrangements in optimising morning peak-hour travel demand: A survival analysis approach,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104229,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"A flex-time arrangement offers an alternative to the traditional 8:00 am to 4:00 pm work. It has proven to be an effective way of reshaping peak-hour travel demand, allowing workers to alter their departure time. Prior studies focused on the departure times of fixed and flex-time workers without categorising them by work-from-home options (non-teleworkers, hybrid workers, and passive teleworkers). Nevertheless, the factors influencing the departure time may vary among worker categories. Furthermore, the data source of prior studies was the Household Travel Survey, collected pre-COVID-19. However, the pandemic has substantially altered workers’ perspectives on flexible work arrangements. Therefore, understanding the departure time of various workers in the post-COVID-19 era is crucial to managing peak-hour travel demand effectively. Hence, this study aims 1) to investigate the departure time distribution of various worker categories, 2) to examine the factors influencing it, and 3) to propose a suitable policy to optimise the peak-hour travel demand. Survival analysis was used to analyse the continuous nature of departure time using data collected from 10 June to 20 July 2023 in Greater Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The results showed that the departure time reaches its peak at 7:30 am. The departure time distribution of non-teleworkers is statistically significantly different from hybrid workers and passive non-teleworkers. Fixed-time workers significantly consider multiple factors when determining their departure time, surpassing the considerations of flex-time workers. The departure time of fixed-time workers is significantly influenced by gender, travel duration and workplace location. The sensitivity analysis results show that optimum travel demand can be achieved by implementing transport policies integrated with 50% flex-time and 50% fixed-time workers arrangements. The proposed methods will contribute to developing a tool to test the effect of various flex-test arrangements on peak-hour travel demand. This study will assist transport planners and policymakers in achieving optimum employer-based travel demand management.",0965-8564,Not found
A comparative analysis of leisure accessibility and equity impacts using location-based and space–time accessibility metrics,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104237,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"This paper assesses inequalities in accessibility to non-mandatory activities (leisure and parks) using location-based and space–time accessibility measures. Most studies use location-based accessibility metrics, focus on mandatory activities (such as work or study), and are on the Global North. We present a comparative study with three location-based and two space–time accessibility metrics, which allows us to consider differences in time budgets and trip-chaining of individuals based on origin–destination mobility patterns data. The case study is a new monorail line in São Paulo, Brazil. The analysis revealed that, consistently across the accessibility and equity measures estimated, Line 15 contributes to increasing accessibility to leisure and parks in the districts neighboring the line, particularly for the lower-income groups. Furthermore, this paper clearly shows the relevance of the temporal dimension of accessibility. The case study illustrates that soft policies such as expanding the open hours of parks would result in higher gains in accessibility, especially for low-income groups. The methodology presented uses open data and open-source tools, thus contributing to an open-science perspective. In addition, the applied space–time accessibility measures enhanced the evaluation of inequalities, often underestimated by location-based measures.",0965-8564,Not found
Segmenting transit ridership: From crisis to opportunity,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104239,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"Crises are an opportunity to learn, and transportation is no exception. The dramatic reduction in mobility levels during COVID-19, the slow recovery of transit ridership and new trends such as remote working have raised essential questions for the future of public transport. Our work focuses on transit rider segmentation, understanding the heterogeneity of users based on their behaviour before, during, and coming out of the pandemic, and what that means for the economic and social sustainability of transit systems. We asked ourselves two main questions: (i) will people continue riding transit after COVID-19? and (ii) what are riders’ reasons behind increasing, maintaining, or decreasing public transport use? Using a two-wave survey conducted in 2020 and 2021, we assessed the motives behind future public transport use in two Canadian cities (Toronto and Vancouver). We used quantitative and qualitative methods, particularly latent class cluster analysis (LCCA), text mining, and qualitative content analysis. We identified six transit riders’ profiles, ranging from those experiencing transport poverty who rely on public transport to those more resourced users who will ride less since they can choose alternatives such as remote work, private modes, or active travel. We discuss the policy and practice implications of these results, focusing on what public transport decision-makers should prioritize to benefit disadvantaged groups and recover ridership.",0965-8564,Not found
Policy incentives and electric vehicle adoption in China: From a perspective of policy mixes,10.1016/j.tra.2024.104235,190,2024-12-01,2024,12,"China has emerged as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) sales due to the government’s industrial incentive policies. However, as industrial and incentive policies undergo adjustments and the market scales up, the efficacy of mixed incentive policies in a mature market becomes increasingly relevant compared to individual policies. Drawing on comprehensive year-panel data from 275 Chinese cities during 2016 ∼ 2022, this study estimates the average, complementary, and mixed effects of EV incentive policies. Our estimates indicate a limited incentive effect of purchase subsidy policies, signaling the need for a phased withdrawal of such incentives while exploring cost-effective alternatives. Furthermore, our study highlights the intricate relationship between policy diversity and overall effectiveness, emphasizing the potential crowding-out effects observed when multiple policies are concurrently implemented in cities. The effect of policy mixes is different among cities with different sales level, income level and population density. The effect of policy mixes is better in cities with a higher sales level, an upper middle-income level, and a medium population density. These insights offer a nuanced understanding of the evolving landscape of EV incentives, providing valuable guidance for policymakers navigating the complexities of incentive strategies in a maturing EV market.",0965-8564,Not found
