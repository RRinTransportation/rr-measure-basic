Drowsiness monitoring based on steering wheel status,10.1016/j.trd.2018.07.007,66,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Drowsy driving is one of the main causes of road traffic accidents. It is of great significance to study the use of steering wheel status to detect the drowsiness of the driver. In the studies of the steering wheel state, there is a general problem of the parameter selection being not comprehensive and individual differences in the way of the controlling of the steering wheel not being considered. A driving simulator was used to collect eleven parameters related to the steering wheel, where four parameters having significant correlations with driver status were selected using variance analysis. A multilevel ordered logit (MOL) model, support vector machine (SVM) model and BP neural network (BP) model were built based on the selection of the parameters. Under the same conditions of classification, the recognition accuracy of the MOL model was shown to be much higher than that of the two other models. It was concluded that the MOL model using the steering wheel parameters and considering differences among individuals outperforms the others in terms of driver's state recognition.",1361-9209,Not found
Recognizing driving styles based on topic models,10.1016/j.trd.2018.05.002,66,2019-01-01,2019,1,"With the explosion of information in our current era, senders of information increasingly need to target their messages to recipients. However, messages within transportation systems, including traffic information and commercial advertisements, tend to be transmitted to all drivers indiscriminately. This is because the information providers (such as other vehicles, roads, facilities, buildings etc.), can hardly recognize the variations within drivers, who should be treated differently as information recipients. As a result of the rapid development of data collection technologies and machine learning techniques in recent years, extraction and recognition of drivers’ unique driving style from actual driving behaviour data become possible. In this paper, two kinds of topic models are investigated: mLDA and mHLDA, to discover distinguishable driving style information with hidden structure from the real-world driving behaviour data. The results show that the proposed models can successfully recognize the differences between driving styles. The study is of great value for providing deep insight into the underlying structure of driving styles and can effectively support the recognition of drivers with different driving styles.",1361-9209,Not found
Study on influencing factors selection of driver's propensity,10.1016/j.trd.2018.06.025,66,2019-01-01,2019,1,"The influence of driver’s physiological and psychological factors on traffic safety is represented greatly as driver’s propensity, namely the driver’s psychological experience toward traffic condition and the corresponding preference of driver’s decisions and behaviors under the influence of all dynamic factors. It reflects driver’s psychological emotional states in the process of vehicle operation and movement. It is essential to the research of driver-assistance and active safety warning systems and also an important concept for traffic flow theory, especially driving behavior. Driver’s propensity is taken as the study object in this paper, physiological and psychological parameters are obtained through analyzing their influencing factors from the related experiments designed. Gray relation entropy analysis method is adopted to extract and sort the principal factors of physiology and psychology, and the influencing factors sequence of driving propensity is obtained. The results provide a good basis for further study of the driver’s propensity prediction.",1361-9209,Not found
A distributed dynamic route guidance approach based on short-term forecasts in cooperative infrastructure-vehicle systems,10.1016/j.trd.2018.05.005,66,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This paper proposes and implements a simulation-based Distributed Dynamic Route Guidance System (DDRGS) by using the latest data collection and communication techniques in Cooperative Vehicle-Infrastructure Systems (CVIS). The framework and data processing procedure of DDRGS are designed by considering practical characteristics together with users' demands. Then, we formulate an integrated guidance model, which is based on Kalman filter short-term predicting information. A time-dimension factor is particularly introduced into the considered network with an innovative hierarchical scheme. Correspondingly, an improved Dijkstra algorithm for the guidance model is developed to find the optimal route. Further, we elaborately coordinate the DDRGS with the online map and other plug-in tools. The developed system shows that the approach proposed in this paper is available and effective for real-world applications.",1361-9209,Not found
Vehicle forward collision warning algorithm based on road friction,10.1016/j.trd.2018.04.017,66,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Forward collision warning/collision avoidance (FCW/CA) systems have been developed to reduce rear-end crashes. Deceleration of vehicle is always defined as a default value in many typical proposed FCW algorithms. Considering the braking acceleration is always changed when the vehicle is braking, this paper analyzed the five typical FCW algorithms and proposed a new FCW algorithm based on road friction. The model described vehicle deceleration variation during the braking process, which was used to set up an FCW algorithm based on road friction considering the lead vehicle in three different kinematic scenarios: stationary, constant motion, and decelerating. Finally, the five typical FCW algorithms and the proposed algorithm were compared by simulation experiments. The effectiveness of the proposed warning algorithm was verified. It was concluded that the proposed algorithm was effective and conformed to the actual situation than the five FCW algorithms. Limitations and further studying recommendations for expansion of the paper were provided at the end of the paper.",1361-9209,Not found
Drivers’ effective decelerating zone in an urban Vehicle-Pedestrian conflict situation: Observational studies and analyses,10.1016/j.trd.2018.05.004,66,2019-01-01,2019,1,"To analyse the drivers’ decelerating behavior in conflict avoidance process under Vehicle-Pedestrian conflict situation is accordingly a surrogate method for the guidance of driver evasive manoeuvre and improving the active driving safety. Field observation data has been collected by video recording and image processing at urban unsignalized midblock crosswalks in Beijng, China and Munich, Germany. The relationship between deceleration rate and vehicle speed has been statistically described. By analyzing how the time-related measures (Vehicle Time to Conflict Point and Pedestrian Time to Conflict Point) and the distance-related measures (Vehicle longitudinal distance to Conflict Point and Pedestrian Lateral distance to Conflict Point) affect the deceleration rate choice, the drivers‘ effective decelerating zone with sight angle has been proposed with the consideration of longitudinal & lateral conflict behavior. Minimum Vehicle-Pedestrian conflict distance is calculated and a 2 m minimum distance is suggested as the threshold for collision discrimination. Comparisons which address the needs to make the intercultural adaptation when introducing Driver Assistance Systems to developing countries have also been made to show the significant differences between China and Germany. The whole work could hopefully be the groundwork in the target of conflict pre-scanning by decelerating zones under various conflict situations and the design of vehicle active safety systems.",1361-9209,Not found
A new transit network design study in consideration of transfer time composition,10.1016/j.trd.2018.03.019,66,2019-01-01,2019,1,"In order to minimize the total time cost of all the trips, a new transit network optimization model is developed in consideration of reducing not only time-consuming transfers but also trips which have to make relatively more transfers by optimizing the layout of the transit routes. In contrast to commonly taking the time cost of a transfer in a trip roughly as a constant in a public transit network design work, this research attaches much importance to the effect of the transfer time composition on the total time expense of a transit trip. A genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the newly developed optimization model. The bus route network in an urban region of a city in China is studied for example in this research. It is confirmed that the new optimization model solved by the proposed genetic algorithm is able to more rationally provide the optimal solution to the design of a relatively large-scaled transit network for its efficient operation. In future research, more experiments are necessary to further validate and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of applying the new model solved by the proposed genetic algorithm.",1361-9209,Not found
A dynamic stability control for electric narrow tilting three wheeled vehicle using integrated multivariable controller,10.1016/j.trd.2017.08.006,66,2019-01-01,2019,1,"Narrow tilting three wheeled (NTTW) vehicle is an upcoming smart transportation system which is a viable alternative to four and two wheelers for personal mobility. It combines positive aspects of a car and a motorcycle. It outperforms conventional cars on the aspects of consumption of less space in traffic and in parking. However, its realization offers certain challenges in order to make it safe, comfortable and acceptable to the consumers. In this paper, a detailed nonlinear seven degrees of freedom mathematical model for an electric NTTW vehicle has been developed. The NTTW vehicle model captures the chassis dynamics of NTTW vehicle along longitudinal, lateral and tilt motions. The NTTW vehicle is considered to have two driven front wheels housed with in-wheel hub motors and one non-driven rear wheel. The vehicle is assumed to be equipped with a tilting actuator to lean the vehicle body and steer-by-wire mechanism to steer the front wheels. Two integrated controllers each consisting of two separate control schemes, first for lateral-tilt dynamics and the second for longitudinal dynamics are designed. The prime objective is to achieve the desired trajectory of the driver while maintaining vehicle stability. A baseline controller strategy is first designed with PID control technique. Thereafter, a multi variable controller strategy using a state feedback approach is implemented. A comparison is made on their respective performances by means of simulating the vehicle model in various operating conditions. These studies and simulations show improved vehicle handling and stability performances with proposed novel strategy.",1361-9209,Not found
"Multi-criteria user equilibrium model considering travel time, travel time reliability and distance",10.1016/j.trd.2017.03.002,66,2019-01-01,2019,1,"This paper proposes a multi-criteria user equilibrium model considering travel time, travel time reliability and distance (MUE-TRD). This new model hypothesizes that for each user class and each origin-destination (O-D) pair no traveler can reduce either his or her reliable travel time or travel distance or both without worsening the other objective by unilaterally changing routes in their route choice decision process. Travel time budget which consists of travel time and travel time reliability is used to describe the reliable travel time. A maximum entropy multi-criteria user equilibrium (ME-MUE) model is presented to address the non-uniqueness of the solution in MUE-TRD model. Furthermore, a route-based solution algorithm based on the partial linearization descent method (R-PLD) is developed to solve the ME-MUE model. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the essential ideas of the proposed model and the applicability of the developed solution algorithm. The results show that compared to traditional user equilibrium and travel time budget models, ME-MUE model is more consistent with the real trip process that the reliable travel time is increasing with the decreasing of travel distance in used routes; and the road traffic is smoother when using ME-MUE model to design the road network, thus ME-MUE model can reduce road traffic noise and air pollution in the urban road network.",1361-9209,Not found
Longitudinal profile optimization for roads within an eco-design framework,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.002,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"This paper proposes a methodology to optimize the longitudinal profile of roads according to either an energy consumption or Global Warming Potential (GWP) criterion calculated for both construction and operation phases. For the construction phase assessment, this methodology is based on a earthworks model that computes the geometric differences between the natural terrain and the longitudinal road profile and moreover uses environmental data validated with real experiments. The operation phase is assessed by simulating traffic over a ten-years period. Traffic simulations are based on vehicle dynamic models, also validated with real experiments. The optimization problem is set up in a finite dimensional optimization. A case study illustrates this methodology. By taking into account actual traffic measurements, the optimized profile decreases by 6% the total primary energy consumption and by 8% the GWP.",1361-9209,Not found
The willingness to pay for a carbon tax in Italy,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.001,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"A carbon tax aimed specifically at the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced by non-ETS sectors (and in particular, from transportation) has been proposed by policy makers on several occasions but has not yet been implemented in Italy. This paper aims to test the acceptability of such a measure and to quantify its amount by estimating Italian citizens’ willingness to pay (WTP) via two contingent valuation surveys involving a sample of 603 people. We find that the median WTP ranges from €101 to €154 if the payment vehicle is an annual fixed carbon tax, and from €0.17 to €0.30 per liter if the payment vehicle is a fuel carbon tax. Such values are found to be consistent with the social cost of the GHG emissions produced annually by an Italian citizen. Earmarking the carbon tax either to mitigate the environmental impacts of climate change or to finance renewable energy projects proves to substantially increase the respondents’ WTP. A number of other impacts on the WTP were also estimated, including: respondents’ attitudes and beliefs, their place of residence and mobility habits, and various socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. The policy implications of this evidence are discussed.",1361-9209,Not found
Iso-emission map: A proposal to compare the environmental friendliness of short sea shipping vs road transport,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.015,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Policy makers around the world are promoting different initiatives to face the threat of global warming. This work focuses on the transport sector. In particular, it focuses on those initiatives that promote the shift of traffic from road to sea by supporting short sea shipping services in order to reduce air emissions. The aim is to contribute to the debate about the desirability of this modal rebalance from an environmental point of view. To this end, the so-called iso-emission map is proposed. This new tool allows to identify the geographical scope where each transport alternative is more environmentally friendly. It is focused on physical emissions, therefore it provides an additional and complementary point of view about the suitability of any modal shift. To illustrate the proposal made, the iso-emission map is introduced through a case study: The motorway of the sea Gijón-St. Nazaire.",1361-9209,Not found
The drivers behind differences between official and actual vehicle efficiency and CO <inf>2</inf> emissions,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.016,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Literature explaining the gap between official and actual vehicle efficiency and CO2 emissions focuses on descriptive analysis to calculate this gap without examining causality. In this paper, we explore this discrepancy in detail by drawing on a database from Emissions Analytics Ltd. that provides on-road emissions measurement on more than 650 vehicles in the period 2010–2017. The data reveal concerning results: firstly, the gap in data relates both to hybrid vehicles (that are supposedly ‘more fuel-efficient’) and to the biggest selling vehicles (medium-sized cars). Secondly, the average deviation rate increased prior to 2015, but decreased following ‘Dieselgate’. The Volkswagen scandal threw light on the discretionary behaviour of manufacturers on this question and highlighted how weak the official tests are: and this in turn points to a regulatory and compliance problem. In other words, the interpretation of the results suggests that after several years of adaptation to the protocol and the corresponding test (but no translated in real consumption), manufacturers have taken measures to reduce the divergence in real terms after the scandal.",1361-9209,Not found
Assessment of freight vehicle characteristics and impact of future policy interventions on their emissions in Delhi,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.007,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Vehicle emission inventory forms a critical element for the air pollution studies. The methodology for capturing intercity freight fleet operations is already available. However, urban freight activity and characteristics may be quite different from intercity freight operations. The present study thus aims to provide a generalised methodology to capture urban freight operations data relevant to emission estimates. Delhi has been selected as the case study city to illustrate the application of the proposed methodology. In order to quantify freight fleet emissions, relevant freight fleet characteristics such as age distribution, fuel distribution, fuel economy, and the number of in-use freight vehicles are established through on-field surveys. Further, special attention is paid to quantify the contribution of previously neglected external freight trips entering Delhi to the city’s air pollution. Comprehensive disaggregated analysis for external freight trips terminating in Delhi and transiting through Delhi is presented. 72-hour traffic count and a 24-hour origin and destination surveys are conducted at 17 entry locations of Delhi. Based on the captured characteristics, different emission scenarios are estimated for future policy intervention in the city. The developed methodology will serve as a means of generating emission relevant freight data for various urban areas. Integration of the urban and non-urban freight characteristics is expected to offer a robust and reliable national road freight transport emissions.",1361-9209,Not found
Life cycle externalities versus external costs: The case of inland freight transport in Belgium,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.017,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"This paper proposes a case study on Belgium in which externalities and external costs of inland freight transport modes in Belgium are compared for the year 2012. The well-known Life Cycle Assessment methodology is used to identify the updated specific Belgian externalities related to three categories of negative impacts: climate change, photochemical ozone formation and particulate matter formation. The obtained values of externalities are then compared to the related external cost values. The objective is to determine if these two tools can be used interchangeably. We find that road transport has the maximum impact for every environmental impact indicator, with rail freight transport presenting the minimum one. We identify that each category of negative impact on the environment does not represent the same percentage of global externalities and external costs. In the analysis of the environmental impact per mode, it is observed that, when external costs are considered instead of externalities, the impact of road transport is slightly increased compared to both impacts of rail and inland waterways. Using externalities and average external costs interchangeably for estimating the impact of specific transport categories on the environment may thus lead to different results and different related policies.",1361-9209,Not found
Built environment effects on fuel consumption of driving to work: Insights from on-board diagnostics data of personal vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.013,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Concerns over climate change and peak oil motivate examining the relationship between the built environment (BE) and individual fuel consumption. Most studies overlook BE characteristics at workplace locations. They often estimate fuel use based on travel distance instead of on actual consumption. This practice ignores other influential mechanisms. This study uses the naturalistic driving data of 660 personal vehicles in Beijing. We apply a structural equations model to examine multiple mechanisms under which the residential and workplace BE affects fuel consumption directly and indirectly through driving distance, travel speed, and driver behavior, controlling for the effect of the street environment along the commute route. We found that all three mediating variables are associated with vehicular fuel consumption for the commute. The workplace BE has the more important effect on fuel consumption than the residential BE, particularly regarding the distance from the workplace to the city center. This study highlights the role of job-housing balance in commuting fuel consumption reduction.",1361-9209,Not found
"Commuting behavior and congestion satisfaction: Evidence from Beijing, China",10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.023,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Megacity growth in developing countries suffers from heavy congestion, which undermines satisfaction as experienced by local residents. Drawing on a large scale individual survey in Beijing, this paper explores the social-spatial differentiation of urbanites’ satisfaction perceptions about congestion by comparing residents with various motorized commuting modes including car, shuttle bus, and public transit. The results show that shuttle bus commuters are significantly associated with better satisfaction perceptions about congestion than other commuting mode users. We find that perceived wellbeing implications vary with demographic characteristics and transport accessibility characteristics. Findings from this study suggest the importance of considering neighborhood built environment into the design of land use and transport policy aiming to enhance commuters’ subjective experiences towards congestion.",1361-9209,Not found
The impact of foldable ocean containers on back haul shippers and carbon emissions,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.003,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"The global cost of repositioning containers is enormous and foldable containers have been proposed as one way to address the problem. This study investigates foldable shipping containers from the shipper and sustainability perspectives. In particular, the viability of foldable containers as an instrument of carbon offsetting for the shipping industry is explored. A shadow pricing approach has been adopted to predict the impact of foldable containers on the shipping rates faced by back haul shippers in the Trans-Pacific Westbound trade. The carbon abatement impact from the use of foldable containers is also estimated via an operational activity-based approach, considering inland intermodal transport, truck idling, terminal handling and folding/unfolding. Results show that if foldable containers become prevalent, inland exporters in the Trans-Pacific Westbound trade could face an average of nearly US$500 per FEU (forty-foot equivalent unit container) increase in spot freight rates for the network studied. Furthermore, the impact of foldable container on carbon avoidance is assessed to be up to 0.4 tonne per FEU annually when deployed in a round-trip liner service in the same network. The results imply that while foldable containers would narrow the gap in freight rates between the head haul and back haul trades, back haul inland shippers would be worse off. Furthermore, emissions abatement from the use of foldable containers would be modest, which limits the role that such containers can have in any proposed “cap-and-trade” schemes. This finding has policy implications on the governance of green incentives and carbon accounting in the shipping industry.",1361-9209,Not found
Modeling health equity in active transportation planning,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.011,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Quantifying the public health impacts of transportation plans provides stakeholders with information that can aid in evaluating alternative transportation scenarios. Active transportation can improve public health through increased physical activity. At the same time, increasing walking and cycling can affect the risk of traffic injury or increase exposure to air pollution. The Integrated Transport and Health Impacts Model (ITHIM) has been applied around the world to understand changes in public health that will result from increases in active travel. However, the model does not provide disaggregate information required to evaluate the social equity implications of such changes. Health benefits are typically reported as a single value (e.g., total reductions in deaths) at the county or regional level. In this work, we draw from several data sources to report demographically explicit (i.e., race/ethnicity and income) results from an ITHIM implementation developed for the Sacramento region in California. This disaggregation is helpful because travel behavior and health outcomes are affected by race/ethnicity and its correlates (e.g., residential location) and planning agencies are required to ensure that their policies and projects are not discriminatory. The results show people of color are generally expected to experience greater overall health benefits than non-Hispanic whites. In addition, the disaggregated results indicate that there is a substantial variation between counties and demographic groups, providing decision makers with the information needed to target interventions to achieve desired outcomes for disadvantaged populations. They also pave the way for further spatial disaggregation.",1361-9209,Not found

In a bid to do so, the odd-even driving scheme was implemented a few years ago in Delhi city on a trial basis requiring the vehicles bearing odd and even registration numbers to run on alternative days with effect from 1st January 2016. Applied for the very first time in India and lasting on a pilot basis for 15 days and also referred to as Phase 1 of implementation, the scheme ended on 15th January 2016 with primary goal of assessing the extent to which such a scheme could serve as an effective measure to bring down and control the excessively high ambient air pollution levels. Other associated benefits, which the study considered, were decongestion of city roads, and promoting use of public transport system and carpooling, besides other alternative modes of transport. The paper presents a comparative analysis of particulate matter concentrations recorded before and during the implementation of odd-even scheme of Phase 1 for three key traffic corridors of the city. The study reports an average reduction of PM2.5 of 5.73% and that of PM1.0 of 4.70% in the ambient air across all the corridors during the days of implementation of scheme, which depicts a small but positive impact of the measure adopted towards abatement of urban air pollution in the megacity of Delhi.

Despite the relevance, emerging countries have difficult to establish and implement alternatives to the conventional scope of fossil-based operations. This paper proposes a method to assess alternative strategies for the last-mile of parcel deliveries, in terms of social, environmental, and economic impacts and presents an application to assess the distribution strategy of a postal company located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Moreover, we developed a systematic literature review to develop realistic alternatives to the baseline scenario, which operates with diesel propelled light duty vehicles. Literature points to the reduction of the dimensions of vehicles, as well as to the migration of the propulsion source to electric energy, as sustainable alternatives for last mile deliveries in urban areas. For that reason, we opted to evaluate the use of electric vehicles of smaller dimensions, tricycle and LDV, in the last mile of parcel deliveries, assessing two alternative scenarios: one with the use of electric LDV type BEV; and the other with electric tricycles.

We demonstrate the performance of the proposed model using a case study based on the Central-Ohio region. The case study shows that proper management of flexibility in BEV charging can provide high-quality frequency regulation services, which is also of significant financial value to the station operator. As such, the modeling methodology that we propose here can further accelerate the adoption of BEVs. This is because the value streams generated by the provision of frequency regulation can reduce the cost of BEV ownership and the net cost of owning and operating a public BEV-charging station.",1361-9209,Not found

On-board compressor water injection for civil aircraft emission reductions: Range performance with fuel burn analysis,10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.021,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"The performance benefit of compressor water injection for a stand-alone jet engine has been investigated in previous work conducted by the authors, as well as other studies. For the same required thrust, the benefits include reduced specific fuel consumption, turbine inlet temperature and NOx emissions. The additional weight implication for aircraft (narrow and wide-body type) with their typical engine type (two and three-spool) for the varied range is investigated here. The emphasis of this study is to establish whether the performance benefit restricted to take-off and parts of the climb, offsets the additional weight penalty of the water injection system, onboard the aircraft. An in-house aircraft performance tool has been used and the changes in performance due to water injection are determined by an evaporation model previously developed. This study shows that the shortest range of 4 missions offers small overall fuel savings of 0.42% per flight cycle. The longest mission, in which the injection equipment is carried for longer (though mostly empty water tank), brings about an overall increase in fuel consumed, by about 0.05%. For the same range, the aircraft powered by a three-spool engine shows better performance. However, both aircraft equally benefit from landing and take-off NOx emission reductions of around 43%. Water Injection is shown to result in similar performance benefits as 25% take-off derate but without the penalties in fuel burn or increased take-off and climb times. Reductions in turbine inlet temperature obtained are worth considerable attention as a means of decreasing the direct operating costs of an airline.",1361-9209,Not found

This study aims at estimating the energy consumption due to the rolling resistance of tires moving over pavements with distinct surface characteristics. Thus, different types of asphalt mixtures were used in the surface course to determine the main parameters influencing the energy consumption. A laboratory scale prototype was developed explicitly for this evaluation. Data mining techniques were used to analyze the experimental results due to the complex correlation between the data collected during the tests, providing meaningful results.

Powering newly constructed vessels to comply with ECA regulations under fuel market prices uncertainty: Diesel or dual fuel engine?,10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.012,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Over the last decade, marine engine engineering has evolved considerably, to the point where engine technology can be considered mature and reliable using LNG as fuel without affecting safety at sea. This paper analyses the choice between diesel or dual engines jointly and considers the alternatives of installing or not installing a sulphur scrubber when building a new vessel. The dual engine is more flexible because it can consume liquefied natural gas (LNG) as other marine fuels but the initial investment is more expensive. On the other hand, the use of scrubbers enables the use of marine fuels with high sulphur content in Emission Control Areas (ECAs), these marine fuels are usually cheaper also we consider Selective Catalytic Reduction technology (SCR) in all cases to minimize NOx. The paper calibrates a stochastic model for LNG and determines four marine fuel correlated prices. The work also considers a possible regulatory change from a non ECA to an ECA in the future. When we aggregate the installation costs to the present value of the expected combustible cost under uncertainty we can select the cheapest alternative. We obtain a minimum of expected present value of investment and fuels cost of 25.62 million US$ with a Dual engine with scrubber configuration. Our work shows that, in the cases considered, the use of a dual engine is the best alternative minimizing the total of investment and fuel costs. Finally, we analyse the distribution of fuel cost and its associated risks.",1361-9209,Not found
Does neighborhood form influence low-carbon transportation in China?,10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.015,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Developing less auto-dependent urban forms and promoting low-carbon transportation (LCT) are challenges facing our cities. Previous literature has supported the association between neighborhood form and low-carbon travel behaviour. Several studies have attempted to measure neighborhood forms focusing on physical built-environment factors such as population and employment density and socio-economic conditions such as income and race. We find that these characteristics may not be sufficiently fine-grained to differentiate between neighborhoods in Chinese cities. This research assesses characteristics of neighborhood spatial configuration that may influence the choice of LCT modes in the context of dense Chinese cities. Urban-form data from 40 neighborhoods in Chengdu, China, along with a travel behaviour survey of households conducted in 2016, were used to generate several measures of land use diversity and accessibility for each neighborhood. We use principle component analysis (PCA) to group these variables into dimensions that could be used to classify the neighborhoods. We then estimate regression models of low-carbon mode choices such as walking, bicycling, and transit to better understand the significance of these built-environment differences at the neighbourhood level. We find that, first, members of households do choose to walk or bike or take transit to work provided there is relatively high population density and sufficient access to public transit and jobs. Second, land-use diversity alone was not found to be significant in affecting LCT mode choice. Third, the proliferation of gated communities was found to reduce overall spatial connectivity within neighborhoods and had a negative effect on choice of LCT.",1361-9209,Not found
Algorithmic climate change functions for the use in eco-efficient flight planning,10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.016,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Aviation contributes significantly to anthropogenic climate change, and one promising possibility for mitigation is eco-efficient flight planning by avoiding climate sensitive regions with only small changes in the aircraft trajectories. Climate sensitive regions result from strong spatial variation of the global climate impact of local non-CO2 emissions, which are expressed by so-called climate change functions. Previous research established high-fidelity climate change functions (CCFs) for aviation water vapour and NOx emissions, and contrail formation with a climate model as inputs for air traffic optimisation. The mitigation potential in this case study is promising but the climate change function simulations are too computationally intensive for real-time calculation and thus cannot be applied operationally. In this study we show for the first time that this problem can be overcome by formulating algorithmic approximations of the global climate impact. Here we approximate water vapour concentration changes from local aviation water vapour emissions, ozone changes from local NOx emissions and methane changes from local NOx emissions (i.e. algorithmic climate change functions; aCCFs) from instantaneous model weather data using regression analysis. Four candidate algorithms are formulated per chemical species and traded off. The final adjusted regression coefficients, indicating how well the aCCFs represent the CCFs, are 0.59, 0.42, and 0.17 for water vapour, ozone and methane. The results show that the meteorology at the time of emission largely controls the fate of the emitted species, where the quality of the aCCF degrades with increasing lifetime of the respective species.",1361-9209,Not found
Ship fuel consumption monitoring and fault detection via partial least squares and control charts of navigation data,10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.009,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"New regulations in the shipping sector aim to give greater transparency to operations and public access to CO2 emissions data. EU regulation 2015/757 became mandatory in January 2018 and urges shipping companies to set up systems for daily monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of emissions for individual ships. Manual acquisition and handling of emissions data may be allowed (e.g. bunker fuel delivery note, bunker fuel tank monitoring), but is adversely affected by uncertainty due to human intervention and will eventually be unusable for monitoring purposes. However, the massive amounts of navigation data acquired by multi-sensor systems installed on-board of modern ships have great potential to aid compliance with regulations but their use is hampered by the lack of effective analytical methods in the maritime literature. This work demonstrates a statistical framework and automatic reporting system for fuel consumption monitoring that addresses the MRV requirements needed to comply with the regulations. The framework has been applied to the Grimaldi Group’s Ro-Ro Pax cruise ships and is shown, in addition, to be capable of supporting fault detection as well as verifying CO2 savings achieved after energy efficiency initiatives.",1361-9209,Not found
Environmental aircraft take-off noise – Sound quality factors associated with unpleasantness,10.1016/j.trd.2018.10.014,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"The article presents the results of a study on the sound quality factors of environmental noise which relate to its perceived unpleasantness, with a special focus on the noise of taking-off aircraft. Data from a listening test with in-situ recordings of aircraft noise at an exposed location were analysed and the resulting perceptual attributes relevant to noise unpleasantness are presented. The results show a considerable unpleasantness variance related to the sound quality of the noise in the loudness-matched aircraft noise stimuli set. The cutting, buzzing, screeching, narrow, sharp, high and metallic, ringing descriptor groups had the largest positive contribution to the observed unpleasantness.

Quantifying air quality benefits resulting from few autonomous vehicles stabilizing traffic,10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.008,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"It is anticipated that in the near future, the penetration rate of vehicles with some autonomous capabilities (e.g., adaptive cruise control, lane following, full automation, etc.) will increase on roadways. This work investigates the potential reduction of vehicular emissions caused by the whole traffic stream, when a small number of autonomous vehicles (e.g., 5% of the vehicle fleet) are designed to stabilize the traffic flow and dampen stop-and-go waves. To demonstrate this, vehicle velocity and acceleration data are collected from a series of field experiments that use a single autonomous-capable vehicle to dampen traffic waves on a circular ring road with 20–21 human-piloted vehicles. From the experimental data, vehicle emissions (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides) are estimated using the MOVES emissions model. This work finds that vehicle emissions of the entire fleet may be reduced by between 15% (for carbon dioxide) and 73% (for nitrogen oxides) when stop-and-go waves are reduced or eliminated by the dampening action of the autonomous vehicle in the flow of human drivers. This is possible if a small fraction ( ∼ 5%) of vehicles are autonomous and designed to actively dampen traffic waves. However, these reductions in emissions apply to driving conditions under which stop-and-go waves are present. Less significant reductions in emissions may be realized from a deployment of AVs in a broader range of traffic conditions.",1361-9209,Not found
Latent demand for zero-emissions vehicles in Canada (Part 2): Insights from a stated choice experiment,10.1016/j.trd.2018.10.010,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"This is Part 2 of a two-part study that explores latent demand for three types of zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs): plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs). Using an in-depth, Reflexive Participant approach to data collection, our survey instrument includes two measures of latent demand implemented with a representative sample of 2123 new vehicle-buying households in Canada in 2017. While Part 1 (Long et al., this issue) reports on a design space exercise, here we summarize results from a stated choice experiment, using a latent class choice model to quantify respondent preferences and motivations, and the heterogeneity therein. We identify five unique respondent classes (or segments) that largely differ by their preferred drivetrain, only three of which demonstrate significant interest in ZEVs: PEV-enthusiast (representing 13% of the sample), PHEV-oriented (22%), and ZEV-neutral (21%). Respondents in all three classes tend to have higher levels of environmental concern or engagement in an environment-oriented lifestyle. All classes significantly value purchase price and incentives, but vary widely in valuation of fuel savings, charging access, and refueling access – with little overall valuation of driving range and public charging access. We calculate conditional choice probabilities as estimates of ZEV latent demand, which is equivalent to 29% of new market share under base conditions, and significantly increases to a high of 49% with purchase incentives and widespread charger deployment. Our discussion compares insights provided by the two stated response approaches to latent demand (in Parts 1 and 2), making a case for overall complementarity.",1361-9209,Not found
Urban form and spatial structure as determinants of the ecological footprint of commuting,10.1016/j.trd.2018.08.006,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"In this research we examine the relationship between the ecological footprint of commuting and several variables of urban form and spatial structure for the case of the Barcelona Metropolitan Region, paying special attention to the role of population density and polycentrism. Stopping the low density urban dispersion and encourage polycentrism are two of the main policies advocated by the supporters of the Compact City Approach to achieve more sustainable cities. The literature on the impact of population density offers inconclusive results and studies that address the role of spatial structure are very scarce. The results obtained in this research indicate that polycentrism has advantages in terms of low footprint. The effect of population density is more controversial. These results indicate that polycentric spatial planning can be a good strategy to reduce the ecological footprint of cities.",1361-9209,Not found
Comparison of the cost-effectiveness of eliminating high-polluting old vehicles and imposing driving restrictions to reduce vehicle emissions in Beijing,10.1016/j.trd.2018.10.006,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Motor vehicle emissions contribute significantly to air pollution in Beijing. Therefore, a number of measures have been taken to control emissions from motor vehicles, including the elimination of high-polluting old vehicles and driving restrictions. We compared the pollution reduction effects and implementation costs of these two policies. The results showed that an average annual investment of about 1.7 billion RMB was invested in a policy of eliminating old vehicles in Beijing, resulting in annual emissions reductions of about 22,600 tons of CO, 1330.2 tons of NOx, 2197 tons of HC, 78.6 tons of PM2.5, and 81.3 tons of PM10. Meanwhile, a driving restrictions policy resulted in an annual loss by consumers of more than 17.84 billion RMB and annual emissions reductions of just 12,000 tons of CO, 845 tons of NOx, 1356 tons of hydrocarbons HC, 53 tons of PM2.5, and 57 tons of PM10.

Patterns and correlates of urban trail use: Evidence from the Cincinnati metropolitan area,10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.007,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Transportation, parks, and health organizations are collaborating to develop multiuse trail networks that meet the needs of metropolitan residents for utilitarian travel, recreation, and fitness. This paper describes how trails are used and explores correlates of trail use in the Greater Cincinnati region. Drawing on a systematic survey of users, we use ordinary probit and spatial models to explore the effects of socio-demographics, trip characteristics, attitudes, and the built environment, on recreational and utilitarian use. Most (89%) respondents report using trails for recreation; just 8.8% say they use trails for utilitarian purposes. Ordinary probit models show that users reporting recreational use are significantly more likely to be female, have incomes greater than $120,000, and travel longer distances on trails, but less likely to bike or walk to access trails. Transit connectivity is negatively correlated with recreational use. Trail users reporting utilitarian purposes are disproportionately male, significantly less likely to have incomes greater than $120,000, and more likely to take short trips on trails and to access trails by cycling or walking. They say they would commute more by cycling if connectivity were improved. Spatial probit model indicates negative spatial relationships among recreational users, implying the absence of a spatially-based common culture of trail use. Trail planners in this region can use these findings to strengthen the planning and design of trail networks and to meet the needs of different users. Given the finding most trail use is for recreational purposes, additional studies of the needs of utilitarian users are warranted.",1361-9209,Not found
Measuring progress towards transport sustainability through indicators: Analysis and metrics of the main indicator initiatives,10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.020,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Transport is widely considered as a sector with significant positive and negative externalities affecting society, environment and economy. The fact of incorporating the main principles of sustainable development into transport planning is of prime importance. However, moving towards transport sustainability is a challenging task; it requires a paradigm shift as well as the constant monitoring and intensive evaluation of the current conditions through broadly accepted methodological tools such as indicators. In this context, the scope of the current research is to provide a complete picture of the approaches which aim at measuring progress towards transport sustainability as well as facilitating the development of new initiatives by highlighting the major trends. Consequently, a considerable number (78) of sustainable transport indicator initiatives were selected through an extensive literature review. Accordingly, descriptive statistics was used regarding the main features of the examined initiatives, while an analysis focused on the 2644 included indicators was subsequently implemented. The current research illustrates the linkages among the sustainability pillars and the selected objectives/themes. It also points out the great variability regarding the hierarchical structure, categorizes the considerable number of themes found in the literature into smaller groups, presents the most commonly used themes and indicators, and finally proposes an alternative categorization of weighting schemes concerning indexes.

The effect of electrified mobility on the relationship between traffic conditions and energy consumption,10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.018,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Decreasing road transport's harmful effects on environment and health and reducing road accidents are major policy priorities. A variety of technologies could drastically improve air quality, reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions of road vehicles: in this respect, a prominent trend leverages Electric Vehicles (EVs), supported by improved performance and energy efficiency through connectivity and automation. A noteworthy research question in the transition from Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) to the alternative technologies, is to understand how Intelligent Transport Systems and other traffic-related measures can contribute to the reduction of fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, a widely acknowledged tenet assumes that congestion removal or mitigation in presence of ICEVs implies also a reduction of transport-related externalities. This paper explores whether this effect still holds for EVs, by performing an analysis of energy consumption over different vehicle trajectories, under both congested and free-flow conditions. Calculations are carried out using two vehicle simulators: the VT-CPEM (Virginia Tech Comprehensive Power-based Energy consumption model) model for EVs and the CO2MPAS (CO2 model for Passenger and commercial vehicle Simulation) vehicle simulator for the ICEVs, for both electric and conventional cases passengers and freight/commercial powertrains have been analysed. Results are presented on real and simulated data related to four powertrain-vehicle combinations, in terms of general trends of energy/fuel consumption versus speed. Interestingly, results show that, differently from ICEVs, the relationship between congestion and energy consumption underlying EVs can change with higher energy consumption connected to an increased average traffic speed.",1361-9209,Not found
Field implementation and testing of an automated eco-cooperative adaptive cruise control system in the vicinity of signalized intersections,10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.019,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"This paper field implements and conducts a unique controlled field experiment designed to evaluate an Eco-Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (Eco-CACC) system that computes fuel-efficient trajectories that are either recommended to drivers or implemented within a traditional ACC system. The controlled field experiment included three different scenarios: normal driving, driving with a speed advisory (manual Eco-CACC system), and automated Eco-CACC. The controlled field experiment was conducted for four red indication offset values (with two repetitions for each offset) randomly delivered to drivers traveling along an uphill and downhill approach on the Smart Road test facility. In total, 1536 trips were conducted by 32 different participants between the ages of 18 and 30 with an equal number of males and females. The collected data were compared with regard to fuel economy and travel time over a fixed distance starting upstream and ending downstream of the intersection (from 820 feet [250 m] upstream of the intersection to 590 feet [180 m] downstream for a total length of 1410 feet [430 m]). The results demonstrate that the proposed Eco-CACC system reduces fuel consumption levels significantly, especially when driving downhill. Specifically, the results indicate that the automated scenario could achieve fuel and travel time savings of 31% and 9% on average, respectively. These results also demonstrate that automatic longitudinal control produces significant benefits over human control (an approximately19% reduction in fuel consumption).",1361-9209,Not found

In this study, the environmental impact of the core design and magnet material for three electric vehicle traction motors was explored with life cycle assessment (LCA): two permanent magnet synchronous machines with neodymium-dysprosium-iron-boron or samarium-cobalt magnets, and a permanent magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance machine (PM-assisted SynRM) with strontium-ferrite magnets. These combinations of motor types and magnets, although highly relevant for vehicles, are new subjects for LCA. The study included substantial data compilation, machine design and drive-cycle calculations. All motors handle equal take-off, top speed, and driving conditions. The production (except of magnets) and use phases are modeled for two countries – Sweden and the USA – to exemplify the effects of different electricity supply. Impacts on climate change and human toxicity were found to be most important. Complete manufacturing range within 1.7–2.0 g CO2-eq./km for all options. The PM-assisted SynRM has the highest efficiency and lowest emissions of CO2. Copper production is significant for toxicity impacts and effects on human health, with problematic emissions from mining. Resource depletion results are divergent depending on evaluation method, but a sensitivity analysis proved other results to be robust.

The solution to this challenge requires changes of travel behavior. One of the proposed means to induce such change is multimodal travel apps. However, understanding the motivators underlying individuals’ travel intentions is essential to design and evaluate their effectiveness. This paper pinpoints and analyses the drivers and barriers that influence individual travel decisions when using such apps. The analytical framework relies on Alderfer's ERG model of human needs that relate the individual’s intentions to three domains, namely (1) Existence, (2) Relatedness and (3) Growth needs. Furthermore, environmental attitude, information privacy concerns and perceived difficulties when using the system are incorporated as to better explain user-sided heterogeneity. The case-study focuses on a new travel information system in Copenhagen (Denmark), which is not yet operational, through a technology-use preference survey among 828 travelers. Structural equation models revealed that the motivation for choices are specific to individual users and depend on wide-ranging factors that go beyond traditional economic and socio-demographic methods. The study revealed (1) different intentions among individuals according to the perceived value of the new information system, (2) a relation between different environmental attitude constructs and users’ needs, (3) a stronger appeal to use the system for individuals with higher needs of developing social self-concept and eco-travel self-efficacy as well as with lower perceived privacy risk and perceived difficulties, (4) that both functional and psychological factors affect adoption intention.",1361-9209,Not found

The present study attempts to explore the impact of various microscale built environmental factors on pedestrian satisfaction with regard to access to metro stations, gathering comprehension into design strategies and policy interventions that can improve pedestrian access. Personal interviews were conducted among metro users living in the vicinity of metro stations in Delhi, India. Information was collected on individual, household and trip characteristics and attitude of people on various environmental factors affecting pedestrian access to the metro. The database collected was analyzed by developing structural equation models. It has been found that four latent constructs affect the perception of pedestrian access to metro stations: safety and security; comfort and convenience; mobility and infrastructure, and traffic factors. Among all the latent constructs, safety and security is the most influential factor regarding pedestrian access, suggesting that it should be explicitly considered as the main factor for understanding the pedestrian access to metro stations. The findings of the study not only call on researchers to explore an inclusive set of environmental and psychological factors affecting pedestrian accessibility to metro stations, but also to understand various aspects of people’s satisfaction in using pedestrian facilities, and in addition for the planners to endorse various design perspectives that will generate a more acceptable and satisfactory pedestrian environment around the metro stations.",1361-9209,Not found
Factors influencing trip generation on metro system in Madrid (Spain),10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.021,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"In the last few years, ordinary least squares (OLS) models have been the most used regression models for estimating trips in urban areas. However, these models present some limitations, whose the most relevant is that they ignore the geographic variations of relationships among variables.

In this paper, factors affecting daily trips made by the Metro system of Madrid (Spain) are analysed through a GWR model. In order to evaluate the factors mainly influencing daily trip generation, a number of explanatory variables, including socio-economic characteristics of the population, land use, accessibility, and transportation system attributes, were considered.

Ecological and safe driving: A model predictive control approach considering spatial and temporal constraints,10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.010,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Road transport plays an important role in the economy but generates huge costs in terms of road trauma and greenhouse gas emissions. The vast majority of previous research efforts have focused on driving behaviours that either minimise fuel consumption, or advise on safe driving behaviours. However, a fuel-optimal behaviour is often difficult to implement due to traffic conditions and may lead to unsafe behaviour without proper constraints. While a range of optimisation techniques are currently available, most lack the ability to both consider time and distance dependent constraints necessary for computationally efficient determination of optimal behaviour. In this paper, a methodology to find an ecological and safe (EcoSafe) driving behaviour by formulating and solving an optimal control problem for the minimum fuel driving behaviour while respecting key safety constraints was developed. We first propose a modified distance-based dynamic programming (MDDP) technique that can treat distance and time inequality constraints while optimising. Then we propose a model predictive control (MPC) structure based on MDDP and Pontryagin’s maximum principle by considering inter vehicle time and time-to-collision as hard safety constraints. In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed MPC method does not require ad hoc tuning of constraint penalty weights in the cost function to ensure safe following distances. Simulation results of the proposed method show that the proposed algorithm produces lower vehicle fuel consumption compared to existing approaches when safety constraints are limiting. Thus, the results demonstrate the importance of considering safety constraints within an eco-driving system.",1361-9209,Not found

The model is applied to car sharing system VAMO, located in Fortaleza (Brazil), and the decision variables comprise pure electric (BEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and internal combustion engine (ICEV) vehicles. Baseline results are strongly influenced by the economic dimension, showing that existing infrastructure and well-established technology are great advantages for ICEVs and major barriers for EVs. In that sense, ethanol arises as a balanced alternative between costs and emissions. However, EVs represent a strong environmental appeal considering global emissions and local pollutants and even with economic losses in the short-term, investments in electromobility could come out as a positioning strategy in a future business with strong perspectives of growth, be it technological or in market share.

Both hedonic and functional motivation have an indirect effect, while attitude has a direct effect on physically disabled people’s purchase intentions for environmentally friendly cars. Apparently, physically disabled people value the opinions of others in their living and working environment.

In addition to the model’s precision, it is, therefore, beneficial to provide a model that is interpretable, as this can assist in the decision about how and which prevention actions to take. For this purpose, a Genetic Algorithm is proposed that carries out multiple regression analysis by searching for the optimal fictional definition of a prediction model.

Roadsides were walked on both sides across the total road length (53 km; overall length walked per season = 106 km) for each field season by 1–4 trained observers at ∼1–2 km/h. Asphalt surface, road verges/shoulders, runoff ditches and road banks/slopes (neighboring habitat) were exhaustively inspected for all dead vertebrates, which were georeferenced and identified. Roadkills (N = 396) were classified into 67 species (5 amphibians, 7 reptiles, 37 birds and 18 mammals). In total, 128 (32.3%) of all roadkills were found within the road asphalt lanes, with the remaining two-thirds (268, 67.7%) outside the asphalt lanes. This pattern was consistent regardless of season and several structural attributes of roads. However, vertebrate class was determinant, with more poiquilotherms (amphibians and reptiles) being detected inside asphalt compared to birds and mammals (off-asphalt casualties were significantly more numerous).

Some 19,991 records from 1645 trucks are available in total. These represent records of trucks driving at constant speed along part of the M1 and the M18, two motorways in England. These conditions have been simulated in HDM-4 by computing fuel consumption for each truck type driving at a constant speed of 85 km/h on a flat and straight road segment in good condition. Estimates are compared to real measurements under two separate sets of assumptions. First, the HDM-4 model calibrated for the UK has been used. Then, the model was updated to take into account vehicle weight and frontal area specific to the considered vehicles. The paper shows that the current calibration of HDM-4 for the United Kingdom already requires recalibration. The quality of the model estimates can be improved significantly by updating vehicle weight and frontal area in HDM-4. The use of HGV fleet and network condition data as described in this paper provides an opportunity to verify HDM-4 continuously.",1361-9209,Not found
"Burn Calories, Not Fuel! The effects of bikeshare programs on obesity rates",10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.002,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"More than 50 bikeshare programs have been launched in the U.S. since 2010. In this paper, I estimate the effects of bikeshare programs on the prevalence of obesity at the county level. To do so, I merge bikeshare system data with obesity data released by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and construct a county-level panel covering the period of 2007–2013. I employ a difference-in-differences empirical framework, in which I compare the obesity rate before and after the introduction of the bikeshare programs in counties that have ever launched bikeshare programs, and use counties that have never introduced bikeshare programs as the control group. Difference-in-differences estimates suggest the significant public health effect of bikeshare programs: the introduction of the bikeshare programs leads to moderate declines in obesity rates; a possible mechanism is its impacts on leisure-time physical activities. I also conduct various additional tests to check the robustness of the above findings. These tests show that the conclusion of this paper is robust to changes to samples and empirical models.",1361-9209,Not found
Electric vehicle charging point placement optimisation by exploiting spatial statistics and maximal coverage location models,10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.005,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly considered as a promising solution to tackle climate change impacts, improve air quality, and enhance growth sustainability. This paper proposes a two-step approach for optimally deploying charging points (CPs) by bringing together spatial statistics and maximal coverage location models. CP locations are conceptualised as a spatial point pattern, driven by an underlying stochastic process, and are investigated by using a Bayesian spatial log-Gaussian Cox process model. The spatial distribution of charging demand is approximated by the predicted process intensity surface of CP locations, upon which a maximal coverage location model is formulated and solved to identify optimal CP locations. Drawing upon the large-scale urban point of interest (POI) data and other data sources, the developed method is demonstrated by exploring the deployment of CPs in London. The results show that EV charging demand is statistically significantly associated with workplace population density, travel flows, and densities of three POI categories (transport, retail and commercial). The robustness of model estimation results is assessed by running spatial point process models with a series of random subsets of the full data. Results from a policy scenario analysis suggest that with increasing numbers of charging stations to be planned, optimal CP locations gradually expand to the suburban areas of London and the marginal gains in charging demand covered decrease rapidly.",1361-9209,Not found
Latent demand for zero-emissions vehicles in Canada (Part 1): Insights from a design space exercise,10.1016/j.trd.2018.10.009,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"We explore consumer demand for three types of zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs): plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs). We assess latent demand, defined as what ZEV sales could be if they were fully available (in a wide variety of makes and models), and if consumers were fully aware of their existence. Using an in-depth, Reflexive Participant approach to data collection, our survey instrument includes two measures of latent demand: a design space exercise and a stated choice experiment. The survey was completed by a representative sample of 2123 new vehicle-buying households in Canada in 2017. Part 1 (this paper) focuses on the design space exercise, which allows consumers to “design” a conventional, hybrid, or ZEV drivetrain, including specific attribute levels. Under higher and lower price conditions, 14% and 21% of respondents (respectively) select a ZEV, with most selecting PHEVs (11% and 12%), followed by BEVs (2.2% and 5.4%), and HFCVs (1.5% and 3.6%). Most respondents who design a PHEV or HFCV as their first choice select a conventional or hybrid vehicle as their second choice, while BEV designers tend to select a PHEV as their second choice. Further, those who select PHEVs and BEVs have higher levels of environmental-oriented lifestyle engagement and altruistic values, whereas respondents who select HFCVs score lower for both constructs. Results provide one measure of latent demand, while also indicating heterogeneity in demand and motivations. In Part 2 (Kormos et al., this issue), we summarize and compare results from a stated choice experiment.",1361-9209,Not found
Towards a two-part train traffic emissions factor model for airborne wear particles,10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.006,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"In 2017 a new railway tunnel containing two stations opened in Stockholm, Sweden. A series of field measurements were carried out on the platforms in this tunnel before and after it was opened for normal traffic. These measurements were used to investigate the contribution of airborne particle emissions from wear processes to total train emissions. This field data was used to develop a two-part train traffic emission factor model for PM10. The two parts are the accumulative effect term (relating to operating distance such as wheel-rail contact and overhead electric line sliding contact) and a brake effect term (relating to the number of braking operations such as brake disc and brake pad contact). The results show that operating a single trial train at a higher than normal frequency on an otherwise empty platform increases the platform particulate concentration until the concentration reaches a steady value. The model suggests that brake emissions account for about 50% of the total emissions measured in the tunnels.",1361-9209,Not found
Urban bus emission trends in the Krakow metropolitan area (Poland) from 2010 to 2015,10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.003,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,This paper discusses the air quality impact of the replacement of buses in the Krakow metropolitan area by buses with better emission standards. The research focuses on the estimated amount of particulate matter and gas pollutants emitted by those vehicles between the years 2010–2015. The calculations have been done using COPERT software and are based on measured and gathered data from 156 bus lines. The emissions inventory presented in this paper is the first highly detailed research done for a fleet of urban buses in one of the largest urban areas in Poland. It was analysed using CORINAIR methodology. The conducted research has a couple of utilitarian aims. The first is an assessment of the emission reduction brought about by urban bus modernization. The second aim is estimating the contribution of particulate matter and gas pollutants by urban bus emissions in the Krakow area. It estimated that emissions from public transportation constitute 2.07% of the total emissions from road transportation in Krakow.,1361-9209,Not found

Traffic is one of the most important sources of CO2 emissions in urban areas. One-year CO2 flux and 36-days traffic flow data were collected by field monitoring in 2014 at the study area. The accurate traffic CO2 emissions on 30-min scale were calculated by the localized MOVES model. The annual emissions were 4139.19 Mg. The traffic CO2 emissions showed a “double-peak” diurnal pattern, with morning peak of 705.14 kg 30 min−1 (8:00–8:30) and the evening peak of 788.40 kg/30 min−1 (7:30–18:00).

Residential self-selection in the built environment-travel behavior connection: Whose self-selection?,10.1016/j.trd.2018.10.015,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Residential self-selection has been acknowledged as a key issue underlining the link between the built environment and travel behavior. Existing studies often implicitly assume that residential choice is a decision of an individual and the influence of intra-household interactions is not considered. In reality, residential choice is a decision often made at the household-level involving more than one household members. Similarly, car ownership is usually a household-level decision incorporating views of different household members. In both cases, the travel related attitudes of more than one household members may play a role in the decision making. In other words, there is an issue concerning residential self-selection (similarly car ownership self-selection): whose self-selection? This paper makes an attempt to probe into this question by examining the self-selection issues concerning residential location choice and car ownership decision from the perspective of households, by incorporating the travel attitudes and travel behaviors of two household heads into an integrated self-selection framework. Data are derived from a household sample survey involving two-day activity-travel diaries conducted in 2016 in Beijing, China. Multivariate modeling results show that household members play different roles in household decisions with travel implications: in general husbands’ travel attitudes have relatively more influence in residential choice and car ownership decision than wives’. Nevertheless, wives’ travel attitudes have more power than husbands’ in explaining the commuting distances of both husbands and wives. Some distinct features of the residential and car ownership self-selections in the Chinese context are also identified and discussed in this paper.",1361-9209,Not found

Particulate matter and PAHs species mass concentrations, especially higher molecular weight PAHs, both increased noticeably from the tunnel inlet to its outlet. In the tunnel, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[ghi]perylene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and coronene were abundant PAHs species, all of which were identified as diesel and gasoline vehicle markers. These species had good correlation. Emission factors of higher molecular weight PAHs were significantly higher than those of lower molecular weight PAHs. The PAHs from traffic-related sources were primarily distributed in fine particulate matter compared with coarse particulate matter. Diagnostics ratios and principal component analysis were used to distinguish PAHs sources. The results showed that vehicle exhaust emissions (including those from diesel and gasoline vehicles) contributed 61.66% and 62.22% to the PAHs for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively, while the corresponding values for vehicle non-exhaust emissions (e.g., road dust, brake line, and tyre wear) were 22.09% and 19.34%.

Fleet routing and scheduling in bushfire emergency evacuation: A regional case study of the Black Saturday bushfires in Australia,10.1016/j.trd.2016.11.015,67,2019-02-01,2019,2,"Evacuation planning provides evidence base for effective decision-making in various aspects of disaster response, such as the selection of safe shelters, dynamic assignment of rescue vehicles, and the identification of safest routes and vehicle scheduling. However, an efficient emergency service response to a short-notice bushfire evacuation is a complicated procedure. Any failure to response promptly to short notice evacuation can adversely affect the effectiveness of operations and hence potentially contribute to increased fatalities. This study develops a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of short-notice emergency response and rescue operations. This model computes the required number of vehicles and identifies the safest routes and schedules for late evacuees under various time windows and road disruption risk. A heuristic solution method is developed to tackle this highly complex nature of VRP due to operational interdependencies. The model parameters are realistically derived from the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, Australia. The results indicate the feasibility of evacuating 1100 late evacuees via low risk routes within the available resources of four shelters and seven rescue vehicles. However, the evacuation of late evacuees from the bushfire affected areas to safe shelters could be potentially affected when the hard constraints such as the time-window are changed. Nevertheless, the model outputs are useful in the development of emergency evacuation plans to mitigate the potential risk of fatality or injury during a bushfire.",1361-9209,Not found

Impacts of wind fields on the distribution patterns of traffic emitted particles in urban residential areas,10.1016/j.trd.2018.01.030,68,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Traffic emissions are a major contributor to urban atmospheric pollution. The wind fields also play an important role in the dispersion of air pollutants from the traffic emissions. However, the effects of different regional wind fields on the diffusion patterns of traffic-emitted fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in urban areas are still unclear and lack quantified measurements. To provide guidance to urban planning and design, as well as urban governance and management, it is especially important to identify the extent to which wind fields affect the diffusion of traffic-emitted particles. To understand the effect, field measurements and numerical simulations were conducted in this study. The field measurements mainly focused on collecting three-dimensional (3D) distributions of concentrations of traffic-emitted particles in a student dormitory zone at a university using instrumented unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The collected PM2.5 measurements were used to verify and calibrate numerical models. Then, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to track the progress of pollutant dispersion and evaluate its relationship to urban forms. The effects of different wind directions (northwest and southeast) on the distribution and deposition of the traffic-emitted particles in the residential area were studied under different wind velocity conditions (1 m s−1, 5 m s−1 and 20 m s−1). As efficient observation platforms, the UAVs employed in the study allowed the capture of the 3D variations in the distributions of atmospheric pollutants in urban areas. The result provides a better understanding of the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants in a specific urban built environment under different wind fields, which can support urban governance and planning and design practice leading to effective mitigation of traffic-induced air pollution in urban areas.",1361-9209,Not found
"Impact of weather conditions on middle school students’ commute mode choices: Empirical findings from Beijing, China",10.1016/j.trd.2018.05.008,68,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Weather conditions have been recognized as important factors affecting school commute mode choices. This paper aims to explore the modal shift of middle school commutes with respect to the variation in weather-related variables, with empirical emphases on the situation in Beijing, China. Data from the latest Beijing School Commute Survey (2014–2015) were adopted, and multinomial probit (MNP) and multinomial logit (MNL) models were developed. The modeling results are in favor of the MNP model because it has better statistical performance. Weather-related variables, including sky condition, wind speed, highest temperature, humidity, air quality index (AQI), and some interaction terms, were found to have a significant impact on students' commute mode choices. Based on these models, an empirical sensitivity measure was defined as the expected percentage change in the probability of choosing each mode with respect to an order of magnitude change in the influential factors. Most of the results are in line with those of previous studies, and some unique results reflect features of Beijing. For example, on days with extremely poor air quality, students are more likely to turn to public transport rather than use a car from active transportation modes. This is probably due to the special urban traffic regulations that restrict household car ownership and car travel in Beijing. These findings could have implications for promoting active transportation for students and serve as references for policymakers and planners.",1361-9209,Not found
Improvement assessment of the OSPM model performance by considering the secondary road dust emissions,10.1016/j.trd.2018.04.021,68,2019-03-01,2019,3,"The paper presents the impact assessment of the secondary dust emission from roads included in the calculations of the OSPM (Operational Street Pollution Model) model to improve the quality of the particulate matter dispersion modelling. The research was conducted on the example of the street canyon of Krasinski avenue located in the centre of Krakow for the non-heating period (1.05-31.08.2012). The calculations of the solid particle concentrations were carried out excluding the secondary emissions, with the secondary dust emissions from roads and with the consideration of the street cleaning influence. Evaluation of the model prognostic accuracy was performed using parameters commonly applied in the statistical validation of the air pollutants dispersion models. Actual data concerning the PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in the air which were used for the assessment of the model performance were derived from the air quality measurement stations located within the examined street canyon.

In this paper, we have successfully modified MOVES model for application in Hyderabad, India. As the model’s default underlying “Federal Test Procedure-based Driving Cycle” cannot represent India’s driving conditions, we have used “Modified Indian Driving Cycle” and local light-duty vehicle-specific driving cycles to revise the emission rates. On average, based on deterioration rate comparison, the emission rates in India are 9.54, 8.37 and 9.45 times higher than the default US emission rates, for CO, HC and NOx, respectively. Based on the results analysis and background information from other studies, the faster degradation of local vehicles are due to different local operating conditions like worse traffic congestion/slower vehicle speeds and local road conditions. The project-level dispersion modeling-based validation results showed high R2 values of 0.656 and 0.648 for CO and NOx, when our newer emission rates were used. Based on available literature, this is the first attempt that tried to revamp the VSP-based emission model, MOVES, for Indian context.

We circumvent these issues by using low-cost, low-maintenance, portable air quality monitors, specifically the Dylos 1700, to observe potential pollution sources and urban PM2.5 levels in Gabon, a country in the region of Central Africa where no air quality data existed prior. Our study occurred during the dry season between June 29 and July 24, 2015 in Libreville and Port Gentil, the two largest cities in Gabon. We collaborate with local students and government employees to gather data on PM2.5 and pollution sources in a high- and low-income neighborhood and explore differences in exposure by socioeconomic status. Due to possible biases from using the Dylos 1700, we are careful to interpret the quantitative size of these effects or differences and instead focus on their qualitative implications. We find worse air quality levels in the low-income neighborhood and substantial neighborhood variation in PM2.5 associated with traffic in low-income areas, which is in agreement with previous work in SSA. Finally, we provide anecdotal evidence that our monitoring approach and resulting data initiated interest and conversations around PM2.5, its sources and impacts at the local and national level.

The sources of BC include vehicles burning diesel fuel, which are common in urban areas in low-income countries. The objective of this study was to examine the possible relationship between traffic and airborne BC concentrations near roadways in Nairobi, Kenya. We measured personal exposure levels of BC in Nairobi in a field campaign in summer 2009, and subsequently confirmed our ability to estimate BC quantitatively by conducting a co-location experiment in Nairobi in the fall of 2011. The central business district of Nairobi recorded 11-h average daytime BC concentrations in the range 20–42 µg m−3 while the main highways feeding into Nairobi recorded BC levels of 17–79 µg m−3. As far as we are aware, the data reported here include the highest multi-hour BC concentrations ever reported in Africa. Samples from gradient sampling showed rapid reduction of BC concentrations with distance away from traffic. The measured BC near the curbside of roadways was estimated to be in the range of 34–56% of PM2.5, implying traffic was a dominant source of PM2.5 emissions in Nairobi. The high concentrations of BC that we observed raises concern regarding potential health threats to workers, residents, and visitors, and highlights the need for policies to address traffic-related air pollution in Nairobi.",1361-9209,Not found

The measurements were combined with traffic counts from a main road (the Ayrton Senna highway) that connects the city to the airport (Guarulhos) and to other important cities and estimated dilution rates from current NOX measurements to compute vehicle BC emission factors (EFBC). The BC emissions represented real operating traffic conditions and were distinguished between HDVs and light-duty gasoline-driven vehicles (LDVs).

Estimates of both the HDVs (170±259mgkm−1) and the LDVs (41±63mgkm−1) show that emissions from HDVs (EFBC(HDVs)) are around 4 times those from LDVs (EFBC(LDVs)). EF estimates for HDVs are consistent with measurements given in the literature not, however, with emission factors for LDVs whose values are slightly higher than those given in the studies reviewed.

Survey respondents faced five choice scenarios where they selected between a conventional motorcycle, an electric motorcycle, and no motorcycle based on price, speed, range, and charge time. Approximately 1200 individuals completed all five choice scenarios and fully responded to socioeconomic and preference questions. As in much of Southeast Asia, motorcycles dominate the transportation system and provide inexpensive, relatively safe, and convenient point-to-point travel. However, motorcycles also produce substantial, harmful local emissions. To estimate the probability of selecting different motorcycle types, the survey data are fit with a mixed logit model with random coefficients. This specification allows correlation across choices over time, flexible substitution across the choice alternatives, and variation in consumer preferences. The results of the survey and analysis indicate that there is almost certainly a market for electric motorcycles but their price and performance will have to be competitive with low-cost, gas-powered ones. Speed, range, charge time, and price all mattered substantially with respondents willing to pay a 7–13% premium for motorcycles with 10km longer range, 10km/h faster speed, or an hour shorter charge time. Charge time was particularly important, suggesting that improvements in battery charging technology and charging infrastructure could substantially impact consumers’ willingness to adopt electric motorcycles.

Black carbon pollution for a major road in Beijing: Implications for policy interventions of the heavy-duty truck fleet,10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.013,68,2019-03-01,2019,3,"Increasing attentions have been attained to transportation air quality in developing countries. Multi-disciplinary models are useful to understand the relationship between traffic dynamics and air quality, however, which generate higher demand for input data regarding traffic and emission. In Beijing, the environmental impact from non-local heavy-duty trucks (HDTs) has not been evaluated yet, which may be an important reason for higher black carbon concentration at night. This study selected one link of the North Fourth Ring Road, a major urban traffic corridor, to characterize BC pollution for typical weekdays by coupling traffic data investigation, vehicle emission calculation and roadside concentration modelling. We found local meteorological conditions would play a more governing role than changes of vehicle emissions in elevating roadside BC concentration, in particular for the night hours when dispersion conditions were significantly worsened. AERMOD-modelled results were in a good agreement with simultaneously observed BC concentration data, which could be responsible for 17% of the total roadside BC concentration during the summer period. We further identified that approximately 30–40% of the total HDT fleet on the North Fourth Ring Road were non-local HDTs, which could increase total BC emissions by ∼60% and roadside BC concentration by ∼2μgm−3 at night compared to a local HDTs exclusive scenario. In addition to stricter emission controls for non-local HDTs, policy-makers may consider allowing HDTs to drive within the urban area at noon under a delicate scheme based on fine-grained weather forecasting.",1361-9209,Not found

It was found that: (i) the increases in CCE are several times larger than the increases in urban size, population, and economic developments; (ii) metro services reducing CCE near metro stations is not statistically significant, maybe because the proportions of car users near the metro stations are similar to the two cities’ average levels, which is caused by their higher household income and the longer travel time using the metro; (iii) in Beijing, there are smallest CCE in the outer suburbs due to job-housing balances, short distance and large percentage of non-motorized mode uses while largest CCE in the inner sprawl suburbs due to car trips with long distance. These findings indicate that to cope with the rapidly increasing CCE, more attention should be paid to developing strong industry and real-estate simultaneously; the improvement in the feeder bus and public bicycle systems should also be reinforced to reduce the total travel time of metro users; and satellite cities with job-housing balance are greatly needed. The implications will benefit efforts to reduce CCE and mitigate global climate change, and they also provide empirical evidence and reference values for other global cities.",1361-9209,Not found
Considering infrastructure when calculating emissions for freight transportation,10.1016/j.trd.2019.02.013,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"In this paper, the contributions to emissions to air related to traffic infrastructure and terminals are analysed for freight transport with different modes. Data on emissions per km road or railway from existing LCA reports are adapted to a selection of road types and one type of railway line. The presented data are for air pollutants, use of primary energy and emissions of green-house gases divided into construction, maintenance and operation phases. These data are then allocated to the traffic-work produced on the infrastructure during its life span. Different allocation methods are suggested for the separate LCA-phases. The research has a focus on freight transport, why data are presented as emissions per vehicle-km for a number of truck and train types. For ports and airports, data are available per tonne of goods over quay or in- and outgoing. These results are then used to calculate the emissions added for infrastructure for freight transport chains. Examples are given showing the magnitude of emissions originating from infrastructure that can be added to tailpipe and other upstream emissions, e.g. fuel and vehicle production. In relation to tailpipe emissions the CO2 emissions from infrastructure is typically 1–7% for road and around 17% for rail. For air and sea the results will vary significantly; for typical intra-Europe routes we find a contribution from infrastructure of about 3% for air and 21–34% for sea, in relation to emissions from the vessels.",1361-9209,Not found
Have walking and bicycling increased in the US? A 13-year longitudinal analysis of traffic counts from 13 metropolitan areas,10.1016/j.trd.2019.02.006,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Local, state, and federal governments promote walking and bicycling in order to reduce emissions and improve public health. Tracking rates of bicycling and walking over time is important for assessing progress towards this goal. In the United States, most data are limited to cross-sectional self-report surveys (e.g., National Household Travel Surveys [NHTS]) or capture only the main commute mode (e.g., American Community Survey [ACS]). This study examines temporal trends (while controlling for spatial factors) of active travel in 13 US metropolitan areas between 2004 and 2016 (with 78% of counts occurring between 2010 and 2016) using repeated counts of bicycle and pedestrian traffic (n = 1319 count locations; 5554 bicycle and 5166 pedestrian counts). We used multilevel mixed-effects models to examine the multi-year trend in bicycling and walking during morning and afternoon peak periods. In the 5 out of 8 models where the temporal trend was statistically significant, we found that, on average, traffic volumes increased at a rate of 2–6% (bicycle) and 2–3% (pedestrian) per year among count locations, holding other variables constant. Presence of bicycle facilities (e.g., bicycle lanes, off-street trails) was positively associated with higher levels of bicycle traffic. Our results based on observed traffic patterns suggest larger increases in bicycling and walking as compared to the trends reported from the NHTS and ACS data. Quantifying the temporal trend from observed counts of traffic may aid policy makers and urban planners in assessing progress towards the goal of increasing bicycling and walking to reduce emissions and increase physical activity.",1361-9209,Not found

Emerging mini electric cars in China: User experience and policy implications,10.1016/j.trd.2019.02.009,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Mini electric cars (mini-EVs) are gaining popularity in many areas in China (∼4–5 million ownership). Mini-EVs are a class of enclosed vehicle smaller than conventional cars. The average range of a mini-EVs is about 100 km, with a maximum speed ranging from 40 to 60 km/h. Their adoption has generated regulatory uncertainty and their classification is ambiguous. While there have been many studies focused on New Energy Vehicles (NEV) (e.g., battery electric conventional car) acceptance rates, purchase intention, and driving behavior; little research has focused on mini-EVs. This paper relies on structured interviews to shed initial light the motives for mini-EV choice and purchase, model choice, travel behavior, and safety. The intention of this paper is to explore key market issues for further analysis and policy intervention; specifically, we aim to profile users and use patterns to inform policy on vehicle standards, licensing, on-road regulations, and subsidy policy. This is the first paper to do this. In-depth interviews with 34 mini-EV owners in Kunming, China reveal an owner profile that is predominately retired male with high household income. Less than half of users have a driver license. Their purchase motives are mostly driven by their age or physical limitations, the convenience and low cost of the vehicle and charging, and the vehicles' low speed. Most users transitioned from using e-bikes and public transit. Policy implications include standardizing mini-EVs designs, imposing a license system for mini-EVs and their users, and sustaining low-speed vehicle infrastructure.",1361-9209,Not found
The choice of new private and benefit cars vs. climate and transportation policy in Sweden,10.1016/j.trd.2019.02.008,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Dedicated to show climate leadership, Sweden has committed to cut 70% of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions in the domestic transportation sector by 2030 compared to 2010 levels (except flights). This study evaluated the environmental impacts of three recent new car policies. Based on questionnaires and market supply data, multinomial logit discrete choice models were developed for private buyers and individuals with company cars for private use, denoted benefit cars. Estimates indicated that preferences among individuals with benefit cars were generally in favor of Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs) as compared to gasoline cars, in contrast with private consumers (ceteris paribus). Thus, the company car market seemed to be the main gateway for AFVs into the fleet; however, average GHG emissions per car sold were similar in both buyer segments, which was likely related to stronger preferences for larger and more expensive benefit cars. The results indicated that subsidies to private buyers would be influential only if they decreased the costs of AFVs as compared to conventional vehicles, and that none of the investigated policies had been very effective in shifting choices in favor of AFVs. Reduced fringe benefits tax for AFVs, annually worth up to €1100, resulted in only 0.7% lower average carbon emissions. A ‘Super Green Car’ premium, worth approximately €2000–€4000 at the time of purchase, decreased emissions by 0.4% among private consumers, twice the impact of a five-year tax-exemption for ‘Green Cars’. It appears that more stringent policies are needed to more substantially reduce GHG emissions from new cars.",1361-9209,Not found
Analyzing collective accessibility using average space-time prisms,10.1016/j.trd.2019.02.004,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The space-time prism (STP) is the envelope of all possible travel paths in space and time between two anchor locations and times, measuring accessibility for an individual given a designated travel and activity episode. Although the STP provides a powerful measure of individual accessibility, transportation researchers often need to analyze accessibility at collective-levels for planning and policy analysis. Deriving a representative STP of a set of individual STPs would provide a general idea of how collective members’ accessibility is performing. However, there is no analytical time geographic method to calculate a collective-level representative STP that is consistent with individual STPs. To fill this gap, this research develops the concept of average space-time prism (ASTP). The ASTP is a representative STP of a group of individual STPs with respect to size, shape, and location. We develop methods for calculating an ASTP using analytical time geography and elliptic Fourier shape analysis techniques. The ASTP provides a geometric and visual summary of collective accessibility: it can be used to generate representative STPs for aggregate geographic units such as neighborhoods and cities based on individual-level data. A possible application of the ASTP is the spatial equity analysis of accessibility. The ASTP can be located at individuals’ anchor locations and overlaid with opportunities, enabling in-situ comparisons between individual versus collective accessibility and accessibility equity analysis considering geographic contexts. We illustrate this ASTP’s capability when measuring the impacts of new transit service on healthcare access equity in a neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio, USA.",1361-9209,Not found
Greenhouse gas abatement optimal deployment of biofuels from crops in Germany,10.1016/j.trd.2019.02.005,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"The optimal role of biofuels from energy crops for greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement in the German transport sectors is investigated under different progressive long-term scenarios, from a set arable land area corresponding to current use. The sectors included are land passenger and goods transport, shipping and aviation. The GHG abatement from the same land area can be increased by a factor of five through switching to higher yielding biofuel options. Silage maize based biomethane and wood based Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG), in either gaseous or liquefied form are the options with the highest GHG abatement potential per arable land unit, and thus markets where such fuels are an option should be prioritised. Sector fuel restrictions combined with fuel yields resulted in the land passenger sector to be the first priority for maximising GHG abatement, followed by land goods transport, shipping and finally aviation. Only when the previous sectors have been covered by renewable options do the following become relevant and thus a large transition is required before aviation biofuels or any liquid advanced biofuel become the climate optimal use of biomass. Applying admixture quotas to sub-sectors yields a lower GHG abatement than an optimal strategy.",1361-9209,Not found
Web data for computing real-world noise from civil aviation,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.022,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"A large amount of data on civil air traffic is now available on the web, thanks to the recent development of flight tracker websites. This paper presents a novel methodology to exploit these data for computing real-world noise around airports. The proposed approach consists of data collection and pre-processing, flight path reconstruction, aircraft noise computation using a best-practice model (ECAC Doc.29), and rendering of ground track and noise contour maps in airport areas. Applications are shown for nine European airports, where the daily air traffic reconstructed from 10,752 collected flights compares well with official records from EUROCONTROL. Among these airports, London Heathrow, Amsterdam Schiphol and Vienna-Schwechat have been considered for the validation of the present methodology, and a good agreement is found between predicted ground noise levels and available historical data, with the largest deviations being detected in the portions of the airport areas most affected by departure events. The present work constitutes the first step to harnessing the potential of web data in aviation, unlocking unprecedented possibilities for assessing the environmental impact of civil aviation and providing policy-makers with a powerful tool for developing guidelines and regulations aimed at mitigating the detrimental effects of air traffic in densely inhabited regions.",1361-9209,Not found
Modeling the GHG emissions intensity of plug-in electric vehicles using short-term and long-term perspectives,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.027,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) can contribute to deep greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets but their efficacy depends on the sources of electricity. PEV GHG intensity can vary over time (and regionally), making it unclear how policymakers should regulate PEVs in the short and long-term. To explore this uncertainty, we model the short-term (Study 1) and long-term (Study 2) well-to-wheels GHG intensity of PEVs in three regions with very different electricity grid profiles: the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. Study 1 uses empirical data on vehicle preferences, driving patterns, and recharge access from a representative survey of new vehicle buyers in Canada (n = 1754) to construct a temporally-explicit model of PEV usage in 2015. Fleet-wide emissions intensity of PEVs varies substantially between regions, with the greatest reduction potential relative to conventional gasoline vehicles seen in British Columbia (78–98%), followed by Ontario (58–92%) and Alberta (34–41%). Study 2 simulates the potential long-term dynamics of technology, behavior, and emissions with the CIMS energy-economy model. With the emissions intensity of electricity decreasing by at least one-third by 2050 and vehicle energy efficiency improving over time, simulation results find that, compared to 2015, 2050 fleet average PEV emissions are 40–52% lower in British Columbia, 57–74% lower in Alberta, and 36–46% lower in Ontario. Overall, we find that PEVs offer substantial GHG emissions benefits compared to conventional vehicles in all scenarios explored. Policy makers seeking deep GHG cuts may want to support PEV adoption, even in jurisdictions that presently use relatively carbon-intensive electricity.",1361-9209,Not found
Development of enhanced emission factor equations for paved and unpaved roads using artificial neural network,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.033,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Road dust is a primary source of PM that is having a significant impact on human health and air quality. In order to efficiently develop PM control strategies, it is critical to improving the ability to estimate the emission levels of PM resuspended from paved and unpaved roads. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed emission factor equations to quantify the magnitude of PM for paved and unpaved roads based on multiple linear regression (MLR) models. However, the MLR models are not suitable to capture the complex and non-linear mechanisms of PM emissions, thereby limiting the accuracy of the MLR-based PM prediction models. This paper is to present a method to improve the quality of the existing EPA emission factor equations for paved and unpaved roads by employing an artificial neural network (ANN). The presented method consists of the following steps: data processing, ANN model training, and validation of the presented method through data testing. The data utilized for the case study were retrieved from the database used by the EPA to generate PM10 emission factor equations for the paved and unpaved roads for a fair comparison. The presented method was evaluated by demonstrating its improved performance as shown in the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) values. The empirical findings of the case study verified that the presented method using the ANN model is capable of improving the quality of the EPA emission factor equations, resulting in higher R2 and lower RMSE values for both paved and unpaved roads. The expected significance of this paper is that the presented method improves the ability to develop more reliable emission factor equations for predictable PM levels that can help agencies establish enhanced PM control strategies.",1361-9209,Not found
A pay-as-you-save model for the promotion of greening technologies in shipping,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.018,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Recently, the Member States of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed on a 50% of 2008 levels cut of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050.

As conventional financing schemes and capacity seem insufficient to cover the needs of existing ships for retrofits, alternative financing options like shared savings models seem indispensable. Most research effort is focused on technical issues, technologies and their impact on the industry rather than on financial aspects. This article aims at merely filling this research gap by devising a pay-as-you-save financing model that fosters the installation of greening technologies onboard seagoing vessels.

Impacts of severe weather events on high-speed rail and aviation delays,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.030,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Transportation systems have become much more vulnerable due to the increased amount of unexpected severe weather events caused by the effects of climate change. One of the direct consequences is that the punctuality of transportation systems is severely affected and the prediction of the on-time performance of scheduled service becomes challenging due to the uncertainty of severe weather’s occurrence. The objective of this paper is to investigate two fundamental questions pertaining to the operational reliability of passenger transportation systems, using high-speed rail (HSR) and aviation in China as an example: what are the impacts of severe weather events on HSR and aviation delays, and to what extent are these systems vulnerable to various types of severe weather events? To address these questions, a dataset with 350,000 detailed, on-time performance records of HSR and air services for the period October 2016–September 2017 was adopted. Based on data visualization and statistical analysis, the study reveals that the impacts of severe weather events on HSR and aviation’s on-time performance vary spatially and temporally. In general, HSR is less vulnerable than aviation to most severe weather events. In terms of the spatial variation, the operation of HSR in the southeast coastal region is affected more frequently by rain and thunderstorms, whereas the system operated in central-eastern China is more vulnerable to snowstorms.",1361-9209,Not found
Energy consumption estimation integrated into the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.006,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"When planning routes for fleets of electric commercial vehicles, it is necessary to precisely predict the energy required to drive and plan for charging whenever needed, in order to manage their driving range limitations. Although there are several energy estimation models available in the literature, so far integration with Vehicle Routing Problems has been limited and without demonstrated accuracy. This paper introduces the Two-stage Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (2sEVRP) that incorporates improved energy consumption estimation by considering detailed topography and speed profiles. First, a method to calculate energy cost coefficients for the road network is outlined. Since the driving cycle is unknown, the model generates an approximation based on a linear function of mass, as the latter is only determined while routing. These coefficients embed information about topography, speed, powertrain efficiency and the effect of acceleration and braking at traffic lights and intersections. Secondly, an integrated two-stage approach is described, which finds the best paths between pairs of destinations and then finds the best routes including battery and time-window constraints. Energy consumption is used as objective function including payload and auxiliary systems. The road cost coefficients are aggregated to generate the path cost coefficients that are used in the routing problem. In this way it is possible to get a proper approximation of the complete driving cycle for the routes and accurate energy consumption estimation. Lastly, numerical experiments are shown based on the road network from Gothenburg-Sweden. Energy estimation is compared with real consumption data from an all-electric bus from a public transport route and with high-fidelity vehicle simulations. Routing experiments focus on trucks for urban distribution of goods. The results indicate that time and energy estimations are significantly more precise than existing methods. Consequently the planned routes are expected to be feasible in terms of energy demand and that charging stops are properly included when necessary.",1361-9209,Not found
Policy implications of liquefied natural gas use in heavy-duty vehicles: Examples in Canada and British Columbia,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.021,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"This study investigates the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from diesel- and liquefied natural gas-fueled (LNG) heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) in the context of Canada and the province of British Columbia (BC) from 2014 to 2050. HDVs accounted for 18% and 11% of the 2014 GHG emissions from the transportation sector in Canada and BC, respectively. Different scenarios are analyzed using the GHGenius model and recent emissions measurements from LNG HDVs. The low emissions scenario of 1  g C H 4 /k g LNG indicates that LNG HDVs could reduce GHG emissions by 22% and 30% in Canada and BC, respectively. Also, the analysis shows that Canada’s and BC’s well-to-wheels (WTW) methane emissions should be maintained below 13 and 18  g C H 4 /k g LNG to produce less GHG emissions from LNG HDVs than their diesel counterparts. If WTW methane emissions are maintained at the current estimated rate of 26  g C H 4 /k g LNG , replacing diesel with LNG in HDVs would change GHG emissions from +1.7% to +24% for Canada, and from −8% to +16% for BC by 2050. Finally, our study indicates that even methane emissions of 1  g C H 4 /k g LNG would not be enough to decrease GHG emissions of HDVs by 80% below 2005 levels by 2050 as is the target set by the Government of Canada and BC. However, LNG HDVs do reduce nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions. Policy makers could support LNG HDVs for immediate reductions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, but should support methane emissions measurements and control campaigns, and other alternative fuels to meet the 80% GHG emission reduction target by 2050.",1361-9209,Not found
Effects of fuel-specific energy and operational demands on cost/emission estimates: A case study on heavy fuel-oil vs liquefied natural gas,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.031,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Maritime industry is in constant pursuit of viable alternatives in order to comply with present and imminent regulations which address pollution by marine fuels. Cost/emission estimates, which determine the efficacy of compliance options, rely heavily on bottom-up methodologies for estimating fuel consumptions. These methodologies employ representative databases for their estimates instead of actual in-situ data. The use of in-situ data is therefore of paramount importance for accuracy of end results on which industry-wide strategic decisions are based. Moreover, total fuel consumption of a potential alternative is calculated simply using energy conversion factors in comparison to a conventional fuel. However, each compliance-option comprises of unique process-components which demand diverse operational, electrical and heating energy requirements which in turn alter their fuel consumptions and emission inventories. Therefore, each compliance-pathway should be assessed individually using in-situ data in order to estimate fuel consumptions and emission inventories rather than using energy conversion factors between them. A case study which utilizes in-situ data is conducted to assess the effect of fuel-specific processes on energy/operational demand and the emission estimates between residual heavy fuel-oils and liquefied natural-gas for a bulk carrier. The findings reveal that allocation and apportion of fuel-specific electrical/heating energy demands as well as operational components to each compliance option would produce more accurate emission estimates as well as realistic cost comparisons. Moreover, the study endorses that the use of natural gas as a marine fuel is highly commendable and asserts that in fact more emission reductions can be achieved than previously estimated.",1361-9209,Not found
"Impact of road grade on vehicle speed-acceleration distribution, emissions and dispersion modeling on freeways",10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.028,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"This study explores how grade impacts vehicle operations, emissions, and pollutant exposures along freeways. Vehicle speed trajectories from freeways are classified by average speed, indicating the traffic conditions experienced by the vehicle involved. The study describes how the shape characteristics of the speed-acceleration joint distribution (SAJD) is changed in response to road grade. Under uncongested conditions, operations are sensitive to grade changes, with vehicles observed to operate more “gently” (lower acceleration rates) as grade increases. Given clear descriptions of grade impact on operations on freeways, the study explores the impact of integrating grade, as well as the grade-SAJD correlation on modeling of emissions. A case study of a 9.5-mile freeway corridor was conducted to explore the potential impacts on near-road PM2.5 dispersion modeling. For comparative purposes, emissions are estimated for scenarios that incorporate both grade and the correlated changes in operating conditions (observed conditions), ignoring grade but employing observed operating conditions, and including grade but ignoring changes in operating conditions resulting from grade. Comparison the dispersion results with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) indicates that the bias caused by ignoring road grade is non-negligible. In contrast, the bias caused by applying actual grade, but ignoring grade-SAJD correlation is much less significant. The study confirms the integrating road grade may be critical for transportation conformity and PM2.5 hotspot analysis. While ignoring grade-SAJD correlation did not seem to cause significant bias in near-road air quality modeling that would require serious attention, unless concentrations are close to a NAAQS limit.",1361-9209,Not found

Differences in planning policy and practices affected how traffic-inducing the land-use development was. The traffic growth was stronger in the affected road corridors than expected, and as compared with Norway. No or only short-term congestion relief was found. It is concluded that the road capacity expansions were necessary conditions for the land-use sprawl, and consequently, contributing causes for the traffic growth. Ex-ante analyses seem not to have included the land-use effects, and this is understood as part of the explanation for the discrepancies between ex-ante expectations and actual development. In both cases, municipal and regional authorities currently attempt to steer land use development in directions contributing to stop traffic growth, in accordance with national policies.

Although the policy measures to mitigate Greenhouse Gas emissions are increasing, these do not include policies aimed at reducing emissions by means of highway geometric design, which significantly influences drivers’ speeds and accelerations and, consequently, plays a major role on fuel consumption and emissions. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to study the influence of the geometric design consistency on vehicle CO2 emissions. To do this, continuous speed data were collected on 47 homogeneous road segments by means of Global Positioning System devices. Vehicle CO2 emissions were estimated by applying the VT-micro model, whereas geometric design consistency was assessed considering different global consistency models. As a conclusion, vehicle CO2 emissions decreases as the consistency level of a homogeneous road segment increases. Specifically, a good consistency road segment has been found to present an emission rate 20–30% lower than a poor-consistent one. Therefore, the design of consistent roads allows, in addition to maximize road safety, to help to achieve more environmentally sustainable highways, reducing CO2 emission production.",1361-9209,Not found

The pollution datasets (black carbon BC, nitrogen oxides NOx, ozone O3, fine particles PM2.5, and particle number PN) were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, diurnal cycles, time-space correlations, and establishing linkages with traffic rates and with wind conditions. Hourly mean (±standard deviation) BC concentrations ranged from 0.58 (±0.54) in the suburban area to 3.43 (±2.69) µg m−3 at the street canyon site (10,150 vehicles d−1 on weekdays), showing a high spatio-temporal variability even at short scales.

PM2.5 and O3 levels presented a lower spatial variability, with poor correlation with traffic rates in the canyon and were more tied to regional sources. NOx, BC, and PN showed the highest reduction potentials connected to the abatement of traffic emissions in the city center, particularly by targeting heavy-duty diesel vehicles. The reduction of PM2.5 and O3 concentrations is more challenging due to a significant regional contribution that requires cutting down emissions at state, national or even transboundary scales.",1361-9209,Not found
Comparison of real-world emissions of LDGVs of different vehicle emission standards on both mountainous and level roads in China,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.020,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs) account for the largest portion of all in-use vehicles and a substantial amount of emissions in China. Among many contributing factors, the joint effect of driving conditions and road grade in a mountainous terrain on vehicle emissions is much less studied than on a level terrain, especially in China. This study presents a real-world investigation of gaseous pollutants (CO, NOx, and HC) and greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions from LDGVs of different Chinese emission standards ranging from China 3 to China 5. Two driving routes representative of the characteristics of a mountainous and a level road respectively were selected, and instantaneous emissions and other relevant data were collected with the Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS). The results demonstrate the statistically significant impact of road grade on the vehicle specific power (VSP) and emissions even after controlling for speed and acceleration (drive schedule) and emission control standards. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveals that, within each of the MOVES-defined operating modes, statistically different emissions are observed across different road grade levels. In other words, the current MOVES-defined operating modes may be inadequate for binning and modeling vehicle emissions of a mountainous terrain. When establishing an emission model for China, more careful classification of operating modes is needed by road grade and terrain type. The study also reveals the lack of improvement in the real-world HC emission control as a result of the stagnant HC emission standards particularly between China 4 and China 5.",1361-9209,Not found
Including social performance as a measure for resilient and green freight transportation,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.023,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Whilst the literature shows a clear relation between institutional pressures (normative, coercive, mimetic) on the adoption of Resilient and Green Freight Transportation (RGFT) practices on the one hand, and economic, operational and environmental performance on the other, very few studies have considered the role of social performance (both society and employee-wise) in this equation. Social performance is currently under investigation as a potential success indicator in RGFT practice implementation. However, well-established models that include this social indicator still lack in the field. To this end, this research builds upon an institutional theory-based model which includes social performance as one of the decision-making factors in the industry. A sample of 107 freight transporters from South East Europe (SEE) provides the data to test several structural relations through path analysis. Results show that the three aforementioned institutional pressures positively impact on RGFT practice implementation. However, the relation is positive for all three pressures only when successful RGFT practice implementation has a moderating effect. Similarly, RGFT practice implementation positively impacts on social performance, through which as moderator, it also yields environmental and economic performance. Lastly, the results show that social performance positively impacts on economic and environmental performance. Overall, this study contributes to institutional theory and green supply chain management by demonstrating the need for including social performance as a success indicator in RGFT practice implementation. Ultimately, this study provides insights for industries and policymakers from SEE and comparable regions.",1361-9209,Not found
Environmental cost and eco-efficiency from vessel emissions under diverse SOx regulatory frameworks: A special focus on passenger port hubs,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.019,69,2019-04-01,2019,4,"Emissions related to economic activities including shipping and its contribution to the degradation of air quality, health and built environment in port-cities increasingly raise attention. Sustained market growth and shipping, also deriving into pollution concentration and an exposure increase over residents and visitors, stresses the need to identify and internalize environmental impacts. In order enhance abatement actions towards shipping sectors, this paper estimates for the first time the environmental cost and eco-efficiency performance indicators from vessel traffic in general and passenger sub-sectors in particular under diverse geographical and regulatory contexts. Emission assessment (NOx, SOx, PM2.5, CO and CO2) of EU (Las Palmas), non-EU but SECA (St. Petersburg) and non-EU non-SECA (Hong Kong) ports is based on the full bottom-up Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM) and messages transmitted by the Automatic Identification System (AIS) over a twelve-month period. Environmental cost is obtained from a top-down approach and the latest seaport-related cost figures. At last, eco-efficiency performance indicators are presented as the ratio of product/service impacts (externality costs) its added value (port profiles). Results present a first approximation to the externality cost of shipping traffic by sea and in port.

Evaluation of technological solutions for compliance of environmental legislation in light-duty passenger: A numerical and experimental approach,10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.004,70,2019-05-01,2019,5,"This work includes an original approach that combines on-road experimental fuel use and emission maps and a numerical analysis to assess the impacts of fuel efficiency and NOx emission reduction technologies on a light-duty passenger vehicle. The solutions analyzed include Stop/Start, vehicle mass reduction up to 100 kg, drag coefficient reduction, as well as SCR and Lean NOx Trap systems. For this purpose, a reference EURO 6 diesel vehicle was monitored under real-world driving conditions with a PEMS and the experimental data obtained allowed building engine maps of fuel use and NOx emission to be used on AVL Cruise software. The results obtained with Cruise were firstly validated with the experimental data (with errors up to 10,6% on fuel and 17,5% on NOx) and then the solutions implemented were tested individually and simulated on 48 real-world driving cycles. The results pointed to Stop/Start, mass reduction of 100 kg and SCR as the most effective solutions in reducing fuel consumption and NOx emission up to 14,6% and 57,5%, respectively, depending on driving context. The combination of these technologies was tested and the results showed maximum fuel savings of 17% on urban context and a maximum reduction of 58% on NOx on combined driving cycles. Despite all the efforts, real-world driving presents NOx emissions not yet compliant with standards, indicating the need for new strategies in order to face the environmental challenges.",1361-9209,Not found

Evolution of plug-in electric vehicle demand: Assessing consumer perceptions and intent to purchase over time,10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.002,70,2019-05-01,2019,5,"The diffusion of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) is a topic that has received substantial attention in recent years. In part, this heightened interest reflects rapid concurrent developments in policy, technology, and industry strategies designed to spur the uptake of this radical, emerging technology. Governments from all levels are enacting various monetary and non-monetary incentives to encourage PEV adoption; developments in battery technology are likening the performance of PEVs to conventional vehicles; and all major vehicle manufacturers now have a PEV offering. Ultimately, however, the effect of these developments is contingent upon consumer interest. Thus, in this paper we study whether, alongside technology and market developments, consumer interest in PEVs has changed over time. To answer this question, we evaluate the degree to which intent to purchase or lease a battery electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, respectively, has changed between 2011 and 2017, and how the factors that explain variation in such intent have also changed over time. Our data come from two national surveys of potential car buyers in the 21 largest American cities. Among the key findings that we derive from the analysis are that, among survey respondents, intent to purchase a PEV has increased between 2011 and 2017, and perceptions about the trialability, observability, network effects, and policies explain an increasing share of the variation in intent to purchase as time evolves.",1361-9209,Not found
Calculating the costs of animal-vehicle accidents involving ungulate in Sweden,10.1016/j.trd.2019.03.008,70,2019-05-01,2019,5,"Animal-vehicle collisions (AVCs) involving ungulate species pose a serious problem in many countries, and the prediction of accidents and costs on a regional and national spatial scale is important for efficient accident mitigation. Based on the assumption that AVCs are determined by traffic volume and ungulate population dynamics, this study developed a relatively simple method for calculating and predicting the costs of current and future traffic accidents involving moose, roe deer and wild boar in Sweden. A logistic population model was assumed for all three ungulate species and econometric methods were applied to obtain population growth models based on panel data on traffic accidents, traffic load, hunting bags, hunting licenses and landscape characteristics for each Swedish county and year from 2003 to 2015. The population growth models were used to predict vehicle accidents and costs. The predicted annual discounted costs of AVCs over a 15-year period based on projected ungulate populations and traffic volume fell by 25% from 406 million USD in 2015, however the allocation of costs between ungulates differed. AVCs involving roe deer accounted for the largest share of the costs (54%), but collisions involving wild boar showed the most rapid increase over the study period because of a relatively high estimated growth rate and recent expansion of wild boar populations to several new counties. However, the predicted costs were sensitive to assumptions regarding population dynamics as well as assumptions about future hunting pressure and traffic volume.",1361-9209,Not found
Global impacts of recent IMO regulations on marine fuel oil refining processes and ship emissions,10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.001,70,2019-05-01,2019,5,"This study presents an overview of the context and global impacts of recent International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations on the marine fuel oil refining industry, future marine fuel mix and ship emissions. IMO limited marine fuel sulphur content in both Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) and Nitrogen Oxide Emission Control Areas (NECAs) to 0.1% (wt. %) by 2015, and to 0.5% globally by 2020. It is anticipated that the newly implemented IMO regulations will help to mitigate negative impact of ship emissions on public health and environment. IMO regulations require significant changes to refineries to increase the production of low sulphur fuels through a shift to distillates, use of novel deep desulphurization techniques, or fuel blending. Changes to the refinery processes can bring forth increases in greenhouse gas emissions and high capital investments. Alternative fuels will need to meet the required reduction of air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions in coastal areas. Alternative marine fuels consisting of liquefied nature gas (LNG) and biofuel may be suitable fuels to meet both targets. These two fuels are predicted to account for 50% of shipping energy demand by 2050, while the remainder will still be supplied by conventional heavy fuel oil (HFO)/marine gas oil (MGO). Switching to low sulphur fuels as a results of the new IMO regulations has led to measureable reductions in ship emissions generally. This fuel switching also resulted in changes in engine emission characteristics, especially on particulate matter chemical composition.",1361-9209,Not found

This study aimed to evaluate air quality and public health impacts due to emissions from vehicles that violate Brazilian emissions standards in Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area. We analyzed particulate matter emissions on 2014–2015 biennium. We projected scenarios in which all circulating vehicles were according to Brazilian vehicular emission control standards and estimated the emissions’ reduction using the bottom-up method. We considered a proportional reduction in pollutant concentration equivalent to the percentage reduction in emissions. The years of life lost avoided due to cardiopulmonary problems were estimated considering the impacted population fraction by air quality improvement. Results indicated that the substitution of vehicles which violate Brazilian standards by more modern models would improve 33% PM10 and 17% PM2.5 air quality and avoid 65,568 years of life lost, which, considering the life year value, is US$ 4bi equivalent.

To bike or not to bike? – Evidence from a university relocation,10.1016/j.trd.2019.03.003,70,2019-05-01,2019,5,"This paper investigates the determinants of cycling in a rather unique setting: the relocation of one of the largest Austrian universities from the North to the East of Vienna (a distance of approximately 5 km). We analyze the students’ cycling behavior before and after the university relocation based on a large-scale (retrospective) online survey. Unlike earlier studies on cycling determinants, which often suffer from endogeneity, we can exploit the fact that the university relocation causes commute-related variables to change exogenously, whereas socio-economic and attitudinal characteristics as well as the trip purpose remain constant. We find a large positive correlation in the propensity to cycle to the old and the new university location at the person level as well as substantial heterogeneity in cycling inclination across students, which can only partially be explained by socio-economic and attitudinal variables. Moreover, we find evidence that past cycling times form a reference point for future mode choice decisions.",1361-9209,Not found
Fuel cell electric vehicles: An option to decarbonize heavy-duty transport? Results from a Swiss case-study,10.1016/j.trd.2019.03.004,70,2019-05-01,2019,5,"CO 2 emissions of road freight transport may seem secondary to passenger cars, but electrification could eliminate direct emissions of cars. For heavy-duty trucks, it is unclear if substituting Diesel is even an option. We developed a data-driven approach to explore this issue: it estimates feasibility considering the daily operation patterns of every vehicle in the fleet. This paper presents results for fuel cell propulsion systems. If every Swiss truck drove on hydrogen produced exclusively by electrolysis, full decarbonisation would draw over 8 TWh of renewable electricity ( 13 % of the national consumption). That corresponds to roughly 60 km2 of photovoltaic panels with 1.5 GW peak power. We found that current fuel-cell technology almost completely realized that potential, provided vehicles could refuel during the day. The autonomy range was generally better than with battery electric systems without significant weight increase (relative to the original vehicle). Refuelling could take over half an hour, requiring a dense energy infrastructure, able to refuel hundreds of vehicles in parallel to avoid congestion (i.e. vehicles waiting). The reduction of direct emissions was easily overcompensated by indirect emissions of generation: the Swiss consumer mix lead to virtually no overall reduction, while natural gas powerplants lead to a significant CO 2 increase. We concluded that hydrogen is technically a very attractive decarbonisation agent for heavy-duty vehicles, but significant investments may be required to ensure that (a) hydrogen production is truly renewable and (b) vehicles have adequate access to additional energy during the day.",1361-9209,Not found
"Travel and energy implications of ridesourcing service in Austin, Texas",10.1016/j.trd.2019.03.005,70,2019-05-01,2019,5,"This paper identifies major aspects of ridesourcing services provided by Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) which influence vehicles miles traveled (VMT) and energy use. Using detailed data on approximately 1.5 million individual rides provided by RideAustin in Austin Texas, we quantify the additional miles TNC drivers travel: before beginning and after ending their shifts, to reach a passenger once a ride has been requested, and between consecutive rides (all of which is referred to as deadheading); and the relative fuel efficiency of the vehicles that RideAustin drivers use compared to the average vehicle registered in Austin. We conservatively estimate that TNC drivers commute to and from their service areas accounts for 19% of the total ridesourcing VMT. In addition, we estimate that TNC drivers drove 55% more miles between ride requests within 60 min of each other, accounting for 26% of total ridesourcing VMT. Vehicles used for ridesourcing are on average two miles per gallon more fuel efficient than comparable light-duty vehicles registered in Austin, with twice as many are hybrid-electric vehicles. New generation battery electric vehicles with 200 miles of range would be able to fulfill 90% of full-time drivers’ shifts on a single charge. We estimate that the net effect of ridesourcing on energy use is a 41–90% increase compared to baseline, pre-TNC, personal travel.",1361-9209,Not found
Policy measures to avert possible modal shifts caused by sulphur regulation in the European Ro-Ro sector,10.1016/j.trd.2019.03.001,70,2019-05-01,2019,5,"The 0.1% limit in sulphur content within Sulphur Emission Control Areas as of 1st January 2015 requires that ship operators either use pricier ultra-low sulphur fuel oil, or alternatively install abatement technologies through substantial capital investments. A part of the resulting higher operating costs are passed on to shippers resulting in increased freight rates. These may lead to modal shifts towards rail or road options competing with Ro-Ro operators. Due to the unexpectedly low fuel prices in the period 2014–2016, Ro-Ro operators were relatively unharmed by the new limits, but nascent research has shown that if fuel prices increase some Ro-Ro services may not survive. This paper examines a set of policy options that can mitigate or reverse the negative effects of the low-sulphur regulation. The measures include internalizing external costs of transport, repaying fuel surcharges to shippers, subsidizing technological investments of ship operators, or increasing the landbased costs of transport via levies. To compare their efficacy, total costs are calculated for each measure. The results show that the proposed measures can successfully reduce the negative effects of the regulation but this would entail significant costs. A combination of subsidies towards shippers and ship operators is shown to be effective at reversing potential modal shifts and can be crucial in case of high fuel prices in the near future. The findings of this work can assist operators to develop new strategies and improve the resilience of their network, and regulators designing environmental policies that may have negative implications on certain sectors.",1361-9209,Not found
"The roles of users in electric, shared and automated mobility transitions",10.1016/j.trd.2019.02.012,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"This paper synthesizes insights from 19 peer-reviewed articles published in this Special Issue on the roles of users in electric, shared and automated mobility. While many researchers and stakeholders remain inspired by the potential low costs and societal benefits of these innovations, less is known about the real-world potential for uptake and usage. To better understand the likelihood and impacts of widespread uptake, we explore the perceptions of actual and potential users, including drivers, passengers, owners, and members, as well as other stakeholders such as pedestrians, planners, and policymakers. The Special Issue examines a range of cases, including plug-in electric vehicles, car-share and bike-share programs, ride-hailing and automated vehicles. For each innovation, we organize insights on user perceptions of benefits and drawbacks into four categories. Much of the research to date focuses on the first category, private-functional perceptions, mainly total cost of ownership (e.g., $/km), time use and comfort. Our synthesis however spans to the three other categories for each innovation: private-symbolic perceptions include the potential for social signaling and communicating identity; societal-functional perceptions include GHG emissions, public safety and noise; and societal-symbolic perceptions include inspiring pro-societal behavior in others, and the potential to combat or reinforce the status quo system of “automobility”. Further, our synthesis demonstrates how different theories and methods can be more or less equipped to “see” different perception categories. We also summarize findings regarding the characteristics of early users, as well as practical insights for strategies and policies seeking societally-beneficial outcomes from mass deployment of these innovations.",1361-9209,Not found
A systematic review of the evidence on plug-in electric vehicle user experience,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.008,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV), comprising both battery and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs), are innovations central to the low-carbon mobility transition. Despite this, there has not been a review of users’ experiences of them. We address this through this systematic review. Of 6492 references located from diverse sources, we synthesised and thematically organised findings from 75. We found a wide range of themes relating to user experiences, characterised broadly under: driving and travel behaviours; interactions with the vehicle; and subjective aspects of the user experience. Most of the evidence pertained to BEVs. Specific findings were as follows. The limited electric range of the BEV was not debilitating and users valued the limited electric-only range in PHEVs. In terms of journey-making, BEVs can fit into users’ lives. Regarding interactions with specific vehicle attributes, regenerative braking and low noise were very popularly received, although the in-vehicle instrumentation not universally so. Users freely offered wide-ranging improvements for future vehicles. There were important symbolic and social aspects of user experience. Themes relating to the former included environmentalism, futurism, and status/identity; to the latter, social influence and gender-distinct experiences. Overall, we qualifiedly conclude that PEVs can play an effective role in the transition: they can meet users’ travel needs satisfactorily, thereby being 'acceptable' to them, and are used at least as intensively as conventionally-fuelled vehicles, implying effective substitution away from more energy-intensive vehicle mileage.",1361-9209,Not found

One recent innovation is e-cargo bike sharing, which links established elements: a cargo bike, an electric motor, and sharing infrastructure. Existing research on mode sharing suggests that sharing schemes face difficulties to move beyond a specific group of early adopters. To gain insights into the characteristics of and perceived barriers for those who adopt e-cargo bike sharing and those who do not, we investigated four groups: active members, inactive members, potential members, and uninterested non-members. We analyzed survey data (n = 301) from members and non-members of an e-cargo bike sharing scheme in the city of Basel, Switzerland, to explore differences in current transportation patterns and sociodemographic characteristics among the four groups. Using a mixed-methods approach, we employed a multilevel regression model to analyze quantitative data. We also applied a qualitative coding system to investigate open-ended survey questions. We found that the present scheme is more likely to attract men, cyclists, and young people; however, other groups were interested. Factors that inhibit wider adoption include safety concerns and the configuration of the sharing procedure. More effort that considers the links among infrastructure, road safety, and cycling competences is required to support the adoption of e-cargo bike sharing as a low-carbon transportation innovation.",1361-9209,Not found

We carried out four in-depth case studies with U.K. fleets that had not yet adopted PiVs to investigate what influences their vehicle selection decisions, and what their potential charging profiles would be if they adopted PiVs. The case studies involved us carrying out interviews with staff in a variety of roles at different levels within each organisation. We found that operational suitability and costs of ownership were the most important vehicle selection considerations. Provision of charging facilities at employees’ homes was seen as a major barrier to PiV adoption by van fleets, as were government contract regulations applying to contractors working for public sector clients. In car fleets where users chose their own vehicles, those choices were made at the personal level, but constrained by criteria imposed by the organisation. The range of vehicle options for users reflected corporate goals such as providing employee benefits, and also corporate views of personal-level symbolic motivations for car choice. PiVs were not considered to reflect such motivations so were not offered as options. Home-based fleet PiVs are likely to be charged mainly in the evenings and overnight, since in the daytime they are in use on company business. In conclusion home-based fleet PiVs may contribute to the early evening electricity demand peak; but there appear to be additional barriers to PiV adoption by fleets that may limit their overall impact on the U.K. energy system.",1361-9209,Not found

Using Finland as a case study, this research aims to identify the possible implications of changing power relations created by autonomous mobility technology. This study uses a theoretical and conceptual approach grounded in the planning research tradition of Aristotelian practical judgement (phronesis). Drawing from political theory of technology, it investigates the social relations that may be afforded by autonomous mobility technology. Adapting a concept drawn from geography of power, it examines how power is expressed in terms of transcripts of dominant technological agency and hidden social context. 31 interviews of extended users in the transition (intermediaries) revealed three dominant transcripts of technological agency associated with the philosophy of cyberlibertarianism (liberation of the driver, safety of the driver and customer accessibility), and four hidden transcripts of social context (restrictions on sharing street space, loss of social safety, vulnerability of passengers, and loss of privacy). The phronetic research tradition that was used in the study revealed several things. The impact of autonomous mobility technology goes beyond the purely systemic, affecting the very fabric of our connection with place and society.

Will consumers prefer shared and pooled-use autonomous vehicles?

Many studies on autonomous vehicles address the sustainability potential of this technology, and they assume that vehicles will no longer be privately owned and will be used with pooling options (multiple riders on a trip). However, there is currently little evidence to indicate whether this assumption is supported by user preference. To address this gap, an online choice experiment including 709 participants was conducted. It assumed the full-market penetration of autonomous vehicles and explored future mode choices, considering both short-term and long-term mobility decisions. The experiment tested the influence of 15 short-term and 13 long-term decision instruments to encourage the adoption of shared and pooled use of autonomous vehicles, like autonomous taxis and autonomous public transport. Our findings partly support the assumption in the existing literature that vehicles are likely to be used in a pooled mode. In the control condition, 61% of Swiss respondents preferred pooled autonomous vehicles over private autonomous cars. Moreover, stated preferences indicated that combined instruments influencing comfort, cost, and time are likely to increase the proportion of pooled uses of autonomous vehicles.",1361-9209,Not found

The degree and speed of these impacts depend largely on who adopts these innovations and how quickly. Leveraging data from a novel survey of San Francisco Bay Area residents, we analyze adoption patterns for shared mobility, electrified vehicle technologies, and vehicle automation. We find that ride-hailing and adaptive cruise control have penetrated the market more extensively than have electrified vehicles or car-sharing services. Over half of respondents have adopted or expressed interest in adopting all levels of vehicle automation. Overall, there is substantial potential for market growth for the technologies and services we analyzed. Using county fixed effects regressions, we investigate which individual and location-level factors correlate to adoption and interest. We find that, although higher-income people are disproportionately represented among current adopters of most new technologies and services, low- to middle-income people are just as likely to have adopted pooled ride-hailing. Younger generations have high interest in automated and electrified vehicles relative to their current adoption of these technologies, suggesting that young people could contribute substantially to future market growth—as they are doing for ride-hailing. We find no evidence that longer commutes present a barrier to plug-in electric vehicle adoption. Finally, women are less likely than men to adopt and/or be interested in adopting most new transportation technologies, with the exception of ride-hailing; designing or marketing technologies with women’s preferences in mind could contribute to future market expansion.",1361-9209,Not found

The conceptual framework of this study is informed by mobility biographies and social practice theory. A web-based questionnaire was distributed by the two service providers to their members, and approximately 1,724 users of P2P and 1,117 users of Coop participated in the survey.

Results highlight that using P2P scheme emerged as statistically significant for students moving to Oslo and for employees starting in new jobs. For the Coop members, the birth of first or later children were statistically significant events in households’ decision to start with car sharing. Along with differences in meanings, skills, materiality and practices of carsharing, users of the two schemes varied with respect to spatial details as well – proximity to transit-stops, access to high-frequency public transport services, walking/cycling infrastructure and, parking facilities.

Collectively imagined forms of social life and social order are reflected in the design and fulfilment of scientific and technological projects as imagined futures shape the technological search space and influence social responses to innovation (Jasanoff and Kim, 2009, 2013). This research focuses on the imaginaries of pioneering and prospective adopters of EVs in business organizations in Milton Keynes. The imaginaries of organizational buyers and fleet managers subtly shaped their exploration of early-market vehicles as they articulated the demands, barriers and motivations of users within their firm. This research draws on a thematic analysis of interviews with business and governmental actors, policy documents and trade literature discussing the early-market adoption of EVs by business organizations. The results identify the processes through which business adopters make sense of the new technology as well as the policies and organizations that supported their learning process. In addition to technical concerns, key aspects concerned patterns of use and demand, fitness for operations, and new business and operational models suited to the characteristics of EVs. Thus, it is concluded that the imaginaries of business adopters and of the organizations supporting them increasingly envision adopters not just as rational optimizers but also as complex problem solvers working out new ways to embed EVs in innovative, competitive configurations that work for them.",1361-9209,Not found
"User decision-making in transitions to electrified, autonomous, shared or reduced mobility",10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.014,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Mobility affords a range of benefits, but there are environmental, social and economic problems associated with current transport systems. Innovations to address these issues include novel technologies (e.g., electric and autonomous vehicles; EVs, AVs), and new business models and social practices (e.g., shared mobility). Yet, far more attention by policy-makers and researchers has been paid to the technical aspects of a low-carbon mobility transition than to social or psychological aspects, or the role of the user. In this paper, we integrate insights from the multi-level perspective on transitions and socio-psychological literature and draw on transport expert interview (N = 11) data, to examine (a) what influences current attitudes and behaviours in respect of EVs and AVs, and shared mobility, and (b) how this may change in the years to come. We argue that technological change may be most compatible with the transport regime (dominated by personal car-based mobility) but potentially affords a narrower range of sustainability benefits, while mobility substitution (e.g., reducing the need to travel through tele-working or -shopping) may be most challenging for both policy-makers and publics, while potentially addressing a wider range of sustainability problems associated with the transport regime. Shared mobility options sit somewhere in between and challenge certain aspects of the regime (e.g., status associated with car ownership) while offering certain environmental, social and economic benefits. For all three areas of innovation, policy interventions need to address the needs, preferences, experiences and identities of users if they are to be effective and sustainable.",1361-9209,Not found
Involving users and user roles in the transition to sustainable mobility systems: The case of light electric vehicle sharing in Sweden,10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.011,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Low-carbon mobility alternatives, such as shared services integrating light electric vehicles, support transitions to sustainable transport systems. However, new products and services are not enough, as changes must also incorporate the practices of travelling, infrastructure, and mobility cultures in which users of mobility solutions are core stakeholders. This paper argues that user involvement is necessary in sustainable innovation processes but that the expected diversity of user roles and their involvement can also lead to contrasting outcomes for sustainable innovation transitions. Guided by theory in user involvement, this study investigated users and nonusers of light electric vehicles in a sharing mobility service system set up as living lab in two large workplaces in Sweden. Fifty-one interviews with employees at the workplaces were conducted during the implementation process and analysed combined with a questionnaire and data from system tracking through sensor technology. The paper finds that both users and non-users are co-creators in building momentum for sustainable mobility alternatives and provides a spectrum of user roles with defined characteristics. Four roles are distinguished within this spectrum: vigilant users, passive collaborators, active decision makers and ambassadors. We suggest that a convergent activation strategy is deployed for involving a full spectrum of users in order to capture their insights in ways that positively affect transition. Such a strategy addresses users and non-users as part of decision-making concerning alternatives and cultivates a culture of user collaboration, while also enabling a plurality of contributions in order to challenge existing regimes and established practices among individuals.",1361-9209,Not found
Green and gendered? Cultural perspectives on the road towards electric vehicles in Norway,10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.003,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"With Norway currently representing one of the few successful electric car markets in the world, our study provides early insights into the emerging electric vehicle culture. In this article, we argue that this culture challenges and modifies previous gendered constructions of cars as well as actual driving practices. When interviewing electric vehicle (EV) owners about the process of buying and owning an EV, we found stereotypical claims of feminine environmentalism and masculine fascination with technology. However, we also observed counter-narratives that destabilise such accounts, reframing the car in more hybrid terms. As a hybrid construction, the EV seems to appeal equally to both women and men, framing their enthusiasm within differently gendered narratives. We also found that owning and using EVs influenced driver identities and actual driving practices. Factors attracting EV users in Norway are many, extending beyond environmental concerns and financial savings. These insights bring crucial nuance to EV user representations and illustrate the significance of cultural inquiries in mobility transitions.",1361-9209,Not found
"Convenience, savings, or lifestyle? Distinct motivations and travel patterns of one-way and two-way carsharing members in Vancouver, Canada",10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.010,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Carshare membership in North America has grown approximately 25% per year over the past decade. Some have attributed this to pro-environmental values and low-impact lifestyles of millennials, the primary users of carsharing. Many municipal governments have adopted this belief and support carsharing through various accommodations and subsidies. Results from a survey in Vancouver, Canada (which has the highest level of carsharing in North America) showed that one-way and two-way carsharing members have different motivations for carsharing and travel patterns. One-way members, primarily millennials, self-report that they carshare for convenience, using shared vehicles twice as frequently and private vehicles three times as frequently as two-way members. Two-way members choose carsharing for financial savings and a more efficient lifestyle. They tend to walk and bike more often than one-way members and the overall Vancouver population. These trip mode and frequency differences are consistent across age, gender, income, and geography. Perhaps as a consequence of the above, we also found that while one-way members are on average younger and wealthier, two-way members self-report as having more affordable lifestyles. These findings point to two-way carsharing members adhering to more efficient, sustainable lifestyles. Municipalities may consider these differences in motivations and trip patterns between one-way and two-way members of relevance in their carsharing policies.",1361-9209,Not found
From value co-creation to value co-destruction? The case of dockless bike sharing in China,10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.004,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Sharing-economy platforms have gained momentum in urban areas worldwide by offering the potential for efficient resource utilisation and novel value creation. A recent addition to the mobility sector of the sharing economy is the dockless bike-sharing system (DBSS), which emerged in late 2015 with the aim of complementing urban mobility and contributing to urban sustainability. However, recently, debate and controversy have emerged about the potential negative consequences of DBSS. Building on the value-creation literature, and drawing on practice theory and the resource-integration perspective, we investigate how users participate in value co-creation and co-destruction activities related to DBSS. Through a thematic analysis of 8813 social media (i.e. Sina Weibo) tweets from April 2016 to December 2017, we find that riding experience is the most important practice in the core using process for both value co-creation and co-destruction, and that post-riding practices can result in significant value co-destruction. In the value-formation process of DBSS, the critical firm resources are product–service resources and relational resources, and the critical customer resources are emotional resources, relational resources and energy resources. We also argue the enabling role of peripheral practices in the transition between value co-creation and co-destruction. We contribute to the literature by proposing a value co-creation and co-destruction framework for DBSS derived from key social practices and resources.",1361-9209,Not found
Free-floating car-sharing electrification and mode displacement: Travel time and usage patterns from 12 cities in Europe and the United States,10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.018,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Free-floating car-sharing (FFCS) allows users to book a vehicle through their phone, use it and return it anywhere within a designated area in the city. FFCS has the potential to contribute to a transition to low-carbon mobility if the vehicles are electric, and if the usage does not displace active travel or public transport use. The aim of this paper is to study what travel time and usage patterns of the vehicles among the early adopters of the service reveal about these two issues. We base our analysis on a dataset containing rentals from 2014 to 2017, for 12 cities in Europe and the United States. For seven of these cities, we have collected travel times for equivalent trips with walking, biking, public transport and private car. FFCS services are mainly used for shorter trips with a median rental time of 27 min and actual driving time closer to 15 min. When comparing FFCS with other transport modes, we find that rental times are generally shorter than the equivalent walking time but longer than cycling. For public transport, the picture is mixed: for some trips there is no major time gain from taking FFCS, for others it could be up to 30 min. For electric FFCS vehicles rental time is shorter and the number of rentals per car and day are slightly fewer compared to conventional vehicles. Still, evidence from cities with an only electric fleet show that these services can be electrified and reach high levels of utilization.",1361-9209,Not found
"Substantial rebound effects in urban ridesharing: Simulating travel decisions in Paris, France",10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.006,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"This paper investigates how and to what extent changes in user behavior may mitigate the environmental benefits of urban ridesharing, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “rebound effect”. Ridesharing reduces both the individual cost of car travel (through cost splitting) and road travel times (by decreasing congestion). This may trigger a number of behavioral changes among transportation users, including: making less detours to avoid congestion (route choice effect), switching from public transit and active modes to the car (modal shift effect), travelling longer distances (distance effect), and relocating further from the urban center (relocation effect). Taking Paris region as a case study, this research applies an integrated transportation/land-use model to evaluate several ridesharing scenarios and quantify the four rebound effects. The overall rebound effect is found to be substantial, cancelling out from 68 to 77% of CO2 emission reductions and from 52 to 73% of aggregated social benefits (including congestion, air quality, CO2 emissions, noise) expected from ridesharing. This is primarily the result of the modal shift effect, supplemented as ridesharing develops by the distance effect. Although the simplified representation of ridesharing in the baseline model calls for caution regarding these estimates, a sensitivity analysis corroborates the main findings and the prevalence of substantial rebound effects. The paper also investigates to what extent three complementary policies - improving public transit, reducing road capacity or increasing the cost of car travel – might limit the overall rebound effect and thereby maximize the benefits of urban ridesharing.",1361-9209,Not found
Who will be the early adopters of automated vehicles? Insights from a survey of electric vehicle owners in the United States,10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.001,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Most major automakers are developing vehicles with some level of automated driving capability. These vehicles range from those with adaptive cruise control to full driverless vehicles. These vehicles are collectively referred to as automated vehicles. The adoption of automated vehicles by consumers is not well understood. It is likely that the first buyers will be typical early adopters i.e. consumers who have different lifestyles, attitudes, and socio-demographic profiles compared to the general population. Using a questionnaire survey of 2715 consumers in 36 states in the USA, we investigate the attitudes of early adopters of one automotive technology: plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). This sample was selected so that the perceptions and purchase intentions of early adopters could be investigated. This is opposed to assessing the attitudes of the public who are unlikely to be knowledgeable about automated vehicles and unable to accurately assess the vehicles and estimate their own purchase intentions. This study finds that PEV early adopters have positive perceptions of automated vehicles. However, being a PEV adopter does not necessarily lead to interest in purchasing an automated vehicle. PEV adopters are clustered into 5 different groups with differing levels of interest in automated vehicles (from “Pioneers” to “Laggards”). The results suggest that automated vehicles are likely to be purchased by a small group of pioneering consumers. These “Pioneers” are likely to be high income consumers, with good knowledge and positive perceptions of the automated vehicles (on safety, comfort, and purchase price), and positive attitudes towards technology in general.",1361-9209,Not found
Who wants shared mobility? Lessons from early adopters and mainstream drivers on electric carsharing in Germany,10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.011,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Shared mobility can contribute to tackling many of the pressing problems from transport and initiate a system change. But who is attracted by shared mobility and who not? How is this related to the attractiveness of electric driving? What are the perceptions underlying those preferences? We try to answer these questions based on two survey studies from Germany with a focus on carsharing. First, we present findings from an online survey (n = 1548) in one of Germany’s showcase regions for electric vehicles (EVs) to analyse the acceptance of carsharing in society. The data analysis shows that perceived compatibility with daily life is the most important factor related to the attitudes towards carsharing and that social norms also play an important role. Second, we analyse early adopters of electric carsharing, i.e. a combination of both innovations in more detail. We draw on a survey (n = 947) from field trials in Germany. We find that – extending the results of study 1 – the users are a socio-demographically specific group. A segmentation revealed that carsharing with EVs is particularly attractive for younger people who (i) live as a couple but without cars or (ii) are starting a family and use carsharing as a supplement to their own cars. The findings from the second study are in line with the first one and also emphasise that the affinity for carsharing and EVs is closely connected.

Technological diffusion as a process of societal embedding: Lessons from historical automobile transitions for future electric mobility,10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.012,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Technological diffusion can be understood as a broader process of co-construction of technology and its environment. This article conceptualizes this co-construction as a process of societal embedding, in which new technologies find their place in wider societal domains, which include immediate user contexts, cultural meanings, policies, and infrastructures. This perspective helps address three under-developed dimensions in adoption models: (1) diffusion includes more actors than users/adopters, (2) user characteristics and environments are not known in advance, but are articulated during the technological diffusion process, and (3) societal embedding is full of choices and struggles that affect the directionality and thus shape of socio-technical systems. Societal embedding therefore calls importance to the “demand side” of sustainability transitions. Because electric vehicles have, so far, only achieved limited diffusion globally, we cannot use it to test and illustrate our framework. We therefore use a historical comparative research design, which utilizes the societal embedding framework with two case studies of automobile diffusion in the United States and the Netherlands between the 1880s and 1970s. We subsequently apply the resulting lessons and insights to the future development of electric vehicles, with examples from multiple countries. An important finding is that the successful diffusion of electric vehicles demands a more robust co-construction policy focus that includes tinkering with all aspects of the societal embedding process, and one involving a constellation of agents beyond policymakers and purchasers.",1361-9209,Not found
How will automated vehicles shape users’ daily activities? Insights from focus groups with commuters in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.014,71,2019-06-01,2019,6,"Automated Vehicles (AVs) are expected to allow their users to engage in a broad range of non-driving activities while travelling, such as working, sleeping, playing games. The impact of this possibility on the satisfaction with travel and on travel demand has been extensively discussed in the literature. However, it has been hardly recognised that the availability of on-board activities influences the (time-geographic) constraints of daily activities and may alter the selection, location, and sequencing of other activities in the day. This hampers correct representation of travel behaviour in activity-based models aiming to predict the effects of AVs on mobility and environment (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions). To help fill this gap, we gathered and analysed qualitative data from focus groups, in which 27 commuters discussed their expectations concerning on-board activities and daily schedules in the AV-era. Among the core insights are the following three. First, it is useful to separate in modelling the satisfaction with travel and the potential for on-board activities during travel: they have different determinants and different consequences for activity schedules and individual travel demand. Second, on-board activities may be classified in 4 quadrants according to their novelty and priority level: this classification is helpful in understanding the potential re-arrangements of daily activities. Third, performing new activities during travel may lead to complex re-arrangements of daily activity patterns; the re-arrangements may ease or also increase time pressure. These, and other reported insights may facilitate more realistic representation of activity-travel behaviour in future travel behaviour models.",1361-9209,Not found

To assess sector-wide inertia in the transportation sector, this paper develops an agent-based stochastic simulation for characterization of the U.S. light-duty (LD) vehicle fleet, applying the output to quantifying the effect of electric vehicles sales on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the fleet as a whole. Such a model framework allows us to study transportation policies that might affect scrappage rates, vehicle types, and car sharing adoption and comparing them to different exogenous electric vehicle adoption scenarios. Overall, we find that the impact of scrappage rate on emissions is small – but could have synergistic interactions with our exogenous electric vehicle adoption scenarios. Furthermore, the impact of restricting vehicle type is negligible. Grid decarbonization has a large effect, roughly the same as doubling EV saturation. Lastly, mandating shared fleet electrification could have the same effect as decarbonization.",1361-9209,Not found

Furthermore, the complex interactions and power dynamics between different stakeholders introduce additional difficulties when attempting to predict the effects of different policies. In this study, we extend the current perspective on urban logistics decision-making by adopting a Complex Adaptive System (CAS) perspective. This allows us to better interpret the behaviors of urban logistics stakeholders and elucidate some of the most pressing challenges encountered in urban logistics policy-making. Building on the extant urban logistics and CAS literature, we establish an integrative decision-making framework that aims at increasing the success of urban logistics policies.

The potential of car advertising in pursuing transport policy goals: Code of good practices in the Spanish context,10.1016/j.trd.2019.05.010,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Climate change, which is mostly caused by CO2 emissions, continues to be a serious environmental problem. The dissemination of correct information regarding the environmental impact of car CO2 emissions and fuel consumption promoted by responsible advertising plays an important role in this problem. This article proposes that the promotion of responsible car advertising could serve as a tool for reducing climate change and decarbonizing transport. Thus, a qualitative and quantitative study was performed to analyse the influence of car advertising on CO2 emissions and attitudes regarding such emissions. The results of this study add value to the limited literature in the field of advertising, cars, and the environment. The analysis of the car advertising sector in Spain in 2007, 2015, and 2016 detected a low presence of good practices. Advertisements lack information regarding energy problems related to mobility, emissions, and climate change. There is an effort to hide CO2 emissions and fuel consumption information in advertising, energy labels are not presented, and information related to efficient driving or moderate vehicle use is lacking. Although the evolution of information regarding emissions and consumption has improved over time with respect to size and location in the advertisements, such data remains marginal. Recent car advertising does not highlight the environmental consequences of the products or offer advice to consumers regarding habits that can help reduce pollution or emissions. Finally, based on this analysis, a detailed code of 28 good practices for the responsible advertising of cars is proposed.",1361-9209,Not found
Contributions of shared autonomous vehicles to climate change mitigation,10.1016/j.trd.2019.05.005,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"The climate change impacts of the anticipated growth in shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are highly uncertain due to competing mechanisms whose magnitudes are difficult to estimate. On the one hand, SAVs could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by driving more efficiently, avoiding traffic congestion, accelerating adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and charging in alignment with renewable electricity generation. On the other hand, SAVs could induce more vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by lowering the time cost of travel and allowing non-drivers to travel more by car. In this study, we develop an energy system optimization model that integrates the electricity and transport sectors, computes endogenous technology adoption, and distinguishes SAVs from privately owned vehicles (POVs) to explore the contributions of SAVs to climate change mitigation. Our results show that widespread SAV adoption lowers costs and emissions, and that these desirable outcomes remain true even if SAVs induce double the VMT of the POVs they replace. SAVs dramatically accelerate the market penetration of electric vehicles. The environmental and economic benefits of this electrification trend are larger if electric SAV charging can be optimally aligned with renewable electricity generation. Especially in the short to medium term, SAV adoption can be a more impactful lever than a carbon tax for decarbonizing vehicle travel.",1361-9209,Not found
When to go electric?

In order to address some of these emission sources, alternative fuel technology vehicles are becoming more progressive and market ready. Transit agencies are making an effort to reduce their carbon footprint by adopting these technologies. The overarching objective of this paper is to aid transit agencies make more informed decisions regarding the process of replacing a diesel fleet with alternative-technology buses to minimize GHG emissions. This study investigates the complete course of fleet replacement using a deterministic mixed integer programming. Bus fleet replacement is optimized by minimizing the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of owning and operating a fleet of buses and required infrastructures while reducing GHG emission simultaneously. Buses operated by Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) were used as a case-study. Results also show a significant reduction in both cost and emission for optimized replacement schedule vs the unoptimized one. Results also show that a fleet consisting of 79% Battery Electric Bus and 21% Diesel Hybrid Bus yields the least cost solution which conforms to the other operational and environmental constraints. This study also includes various sensitivity tests, that illustrates that although the magnitude of the results may vary depending on the input data, the direction remains the same.

Driving dynamics parameters were correlated with cumulative NO X emissions measured during on-road driving on urban roads. In this work, the vehicle was driven on two different urban routes, one with mostly hilly roads and the other with predominately flat roads to assess the effect of road gradient on NO X emissions. Each route was driven six times, the first drive on each route was driven very timidly, each subsequent drive systematically became more aggressive with the sixth drive being very aggressive. From the vehicle speed and road gradient data, the instantaneous vehicle energy was estimated and correlated against the instantaneous NO X emission. In order to investigate for monotonic relationships, Spearmans rank correlation coefficient was used to investigate potential correlations between NO X emissions and driving parameters. A strong positive correlation was observed between instantaneous NO X emissions and instantaneous vehicle energy irrespective of the driving behaviour. The correlation of driving dynamics parameters with NO X emissions also showed a similar trend indicating that driving aggressiveness and vehicle NO X emissions have a strong relationship. Also there is evidence that the influence of road gradient on NO X emissions decreases with an increase in driving aggressiveness.",1361-9209,Not found
Surrogate-based optimization for the design of area charging schemes under environmental constraints,10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.015,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"A surrogate-based solution heuristic is presented for single-objective cordon and area-based road pricing problems that consider environmental constraints. In the proposed algorithm, surrogate models are constructed using geometric representations of charging boundaries. A surrogate model is defined here as a simple approximation to computationally expensive models used to simulate road users’ response to pricing. The surrogates are employed as part of a screening procedure to select the most promising candidate schemes for evaluation by potentially time-consuming models. Departing from previous elastic demand-based formulations of congestion charging problems, this study utilizes a set of objective functions that can be easily integrated with commonly used travel demand models. Environmental considerations are introduced to the pricing problem in the form of pollutant concentration constraints. Two constraint handling strategies are presented to account for the pollutant concentration constraints in the solution heuristics. Numerical tests were conducted to explore the surrogate models’ predictive accuracy and their degree of correlation with the model outputs. On average, the surrogate predictions exhibited relatively good correlation with model outputs (correlation coefficients greater than 0.70). Additionally, a sample application of the proposed problem and methods is presented for illustrative purposes. The tests examined the relative performance of the proposed algorithm, the diversity of the design solutions generated, and the impact of the pricing schemes on pollutant concentration in the hypothetical study area.",1361-9209,Not found

At the same time, increases in future mobility demand require the rapid development of new infrastructures. Here we quantify investment needs for transportation infrastructures over time to achieve both development and climate objectives. We compared investment needs between world regions and analyzed their main determinants. To do so, we built socioeconomic scenarios with the Imaclim-R integrated assessment model, combining alternatives for model parameters that determine mobility patterns. We then estimated the levels of investment that are consistent with the passenger and freight transportation trends in the different scenarios with and without climate policy. Finally, we used a global sensitivity analysis to identify the determinants of investments in low-carbon scenarios. We find that the expenditure needed for transportation infrastructure is lower in low-carbon pathways than in baseline scenarios. This result holds true at both the global and regional scales and is robust to the uncertainties considered. This overall decrease is brought about in particular by a reduction in transport activity. Rail utilization rates and road construction costs are determining factors for investment in all regions. Modal shift from road to rail can be a lever to reduce investment needs only if combined with action on rail infrastructure occupancy.

Gender, identity, and environmental values in Nordic transport practices and vehicle-to-grid (V2G)preferences",10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.013,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"In this paper, we provide a comparative and mixed methods assessment of the gendered dimensions of electric mobility and stated preferences for electric vehicles in the Nordic region. This includes the potential for such vehicles to be configured in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) manner, where they can store energy and offer services to the grid, generating revenue and accelerating decarbonisation. Based primarily on a survey distributed to a mix of more than 5000 respondents across five countries, research interviews, and focus groups, and supplemented with a comprehensive literature review, we examine how perceptions, attitudes, values and identities towards electric mobility differ by gender. We use this data to test, and largely confirm, with some exceptions, three hypotheses: H1: Men use cars (conventional and electric) more than women, more often own a car or EV, drive further than women, and use less public transport. H2: Women have stronger preferences for the environmentally friendly or safety attributes of vehicles (such as EVs and V2G), reflecting higher levels of environmental awareness. H3: Women attach less importance to acceleration, power, or sound, whereas men will emphasize range, sex appeal, and acceleration. In examining these hypotheses about gender, we reveal the more complex social dynamics behind how potential adopters in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden consider and calculate various aspects of conventional mobility, electric mobility, and V2G.",1361-9209,Not found
"How do road grade, road type and driving aggressiveness impact vehicle fuel consumption? Assessing potential fuel savings in Lisbon, Portugal",10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.016,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"The transportation sector contributes significantly to energy consumption with inherent consequences in terms of emission of local pollutants, which is associated with air quality deterioration. Considering that driving behavior significantly influences fuel consumption, this work goal was to assess how driving aggressiveness is influenced by the type of road and by the road grade, and consequently their impacts on fuel consumption. For that purpose, 47 drivers were monitored in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area during 6 months, allowing building an extensive 1 Hz real world driving database (∼33,000 trips, totalizing 28.9 million seconds). This database provided distinctive and representative data, allowing assessing the impacts on fuel consumption rates. Results showed that both road context and aggressive driving behavior impact fuel consumption rates significantly. However, for non-aggressive driving behavior fuel consumption rates increased more with road grade increments (up to 3 times) than for aggressive driving behavior (up to 2.3 times). Furthermore, this study results demonstrated that aggressiveness influences fuel consumption differently across road grades. Aggressiveness impacts are higher for lower road grades, with increased fuel consumption rates by up to 255%. The key findings associated to this research work are that aggressiveness on roads with lower grades tends to correlate with higher percent increase on fuel consumption for all speed ranges. Moreover, aggressiveness seems to correlate with higher fuel consumption on urban streets. Consequently, a reduction in driving under these conditions can offer significant savings in fuel consumption.",1361-9209,Not found
When energy efficiency is secondary: The case of Offshore Support Vessels,10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.006,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Offshore Support Vessels (OSVs) deal with time-sensitive logistics and sophisticated marine operations for high-value offshore oil and gas installations. We investigate whether this creates preferences that effectively penalize energy efficiency, either through lower hire rates or reduced utilization. We apply hedonic pricing fixed effect models which account for technical vessel specifications, contractual terms and market conditions. Our empirical findings show that energy efficient vessels fare worse both in terms of rates and utilization, reflecting industry preferences for high-powered fast vessels given the requirements for on-time operations, such that environmental considerations and energy efficiency is of secondary importance.",1361-9209,Not found
Air traffic assignment based on daily population mobility to reduce aircraft noise effects and fuel consumption,10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.007,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"The paper first investigates the influence of daily mobility of population on evaluation of aircraft noise effects. Then, a new air traffic assignment model that considers this activity is proposed. The main objective is to reduce the number of people affected by noise via lowering as much as possible the noise exposure level L den of individuals or groups of people who commute to the same locations during the day. It is hereby intended to reduce the noise impact upon individuals rather than to reduce the impact in particular – typically densely populated – areas. However, sending aircraft farther away from populated regions to reduce noise impact may increase fuel burn, thus affecting airline costs and sustainability. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization approach is utilized to obtain reasonable solutions that comply with overall air transport sustainability. The method aims at generating a set of solutions that provide proper balance between noise annoyance and fuel consumption. The reliability and applicability of the proposed method are validated through a real case study at Belgrade airport in Serbia. The investigation shows that there is a difference between the number of people annoyed (NPA) evaluated based on the census data and the NPA evaluated based on the mobility data. In addition, these numbers differ significantly across residential locations. The optimal results show that the proposed model can offer a considerable reduction in the NPA, and in some cases, it can gain up to 77%, while maintaining the same level of fuel consumption compared with the reference case.",1361-9209,Not found
The spatial distribution of noise barriers in Montreal: A barrier to achieve environmental equity,10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.011,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Road traffic noise constitutes a major problem for the health of populations exposed to it over extended periods. From a perspective of environmental equity, we focus on the distribution of four segments of the population—children, seniors, low-income individuals and visible minorities—in noise disturbance zones near major traffic routes of the Montreal Metropolitan Community. First, some corridors along these traffic routes with different levels of noise disturbance are defined according to a number of parameters; subsequently, the overrepresentation of the groups studied is assessed with the help of two indices. Next, we attempt to determine whether these groups have access to noise barriers, abatement measures to mitigate the noise. To assess the overrepresentation of the four groups under examination in protected and unprotected noise disturbance zones, multinomial logistic regression models were constructed for the entire territory, and then for six subregions. The results reveal a situation doubly inequitable for low-income persons and, to a lesser extent, for visible minorities. Indeed, these groups more often live close to major traffic routes and are less likely to be protected by noise barriers. In contrast, children are doubly advantaged.",1361-9209,Not found
Impacts of symbolic value and passenger satisfaction on bus use,10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.012,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Because of the symbolic value of the private car, driving a private car is a signal of wealth and a particular social status, but public transit is considered to be a means of transport for low- and middle-income people in the traditional culture of China, especially in face culture. Some prior studies have verified the impact of the symbolic value of the private car on car use and further indirectly speculated about its impact on public transit use, but these studies have seldom focused on the direct effect of the symbolic value of the private car on public transit use. Based on face-to-face questionnaire survey data from a sample of 323 commuters with experience using buses in Changzhou in 2016, this case study examines the relationship among the symbolic value of the private car and passenger satisfaction with bus services and bus use by using binary logit regression. The empirical results show a stable negative association between the symbolic value of the private car and bus use, while the passenger satisfaction with bus services is positively associated with bus use. These findings imply that improving the public transport services is important for the public transit priority policy, and the policy could be more effective if the Chinese traditional understandings of using public transit and private cars are changed.",1361-9209,Not found
Port sustainability and performance: A systematic literature review,10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.009,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Motivated by a lack of research on port sustainability performance and assessment, this paper uses a systematic literature review to identify trends, measurement methods, and mechanisms for the implementation of strategy and policy in this area. The paper provides a comprehensive and critical evaluation of port operational sustainability, focusing on ascertaining the impact of its implementation. The study analysed and synthesised established characteristics in the current literature regarding the performance of port sustainability and its evaluation in terms of operations and management. Successful performance measurement in port sustainability is driven by the dependence on establishing accurate indicators as the basis for measurement. Our clustering of analytical sustainability indicators reveals that environmental research is focused on pollution, social research is mainly focused on human resource management, while economic research is mainly on port management and borderline investment. Findings are discussed in four key areas of port sustainability performance and assessment: existing trends, implementation of measures, mechanisms for implementation, and assessment gaps and challenges. For existing trends, attempts to evaluate the applicability and practicality of green operations have improved the awareness and promotion of governmental green policies. Implementation measures relate to the utilisation of techniques that reveal optimal practices for practical sustainable operations while mechanisms largely relate to establishing indicators which increase understanding of performance. Finally, challenges in this field include achieving consistency among ports in how sustainability is measured. Future research should incentivise improvements in port operational practice and encourage self-examination in order to reprioritise activity.",1361-9209,Not found
Modeling electric vehicle adoption considering a latent travel pattern construct and charging infrastructure,10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.010,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"This paper presents a behavioral model of public, revealed preferences (RP) for various types of electric vehicles (EVs) while accounting for a latent (green) travel pattern construct and charging infrastructure characteristics. Specifically, a two-level nested logit (NL) model is estimated to explain households’ fuel type choice among five alternatives and three nests: (1) battery electric vehicles (BEVs); (2) hybrid vehicles including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in HEVs (PHEVs); and (3) conventional vehicles including gasoline and diesel vehicles. Further, a latent travel pattern construct which captures a week-long number of trips by non-vehicle travel modes as well as daily vehicle and tollway use is estimated in a structural equation setting and subsequently fed into the NL model. Using a recent RP dataset from the California Household Travel Survey, we identify market segments for alternative fuel types based on households’ socio-economic characteristics, built environment factors concerning public plug-in EV (PEV) charging infrastructure characteristics, latent and observable travel behavior factors of a household vehicle’s principal driver, and vehicle attributes. The results highlight that the number of public PEV charging stations is only significant for households choosing PHEVs and interestingly insignificant in the BEV utility. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of the findings reveals that PHEV users are elastic with respect to household vehicle ownership ratio and the latent green travel pattern construct, while BEV users are inelastic to any explanatory variable.",1361-9209,Not found
Machine learning estimates of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle utility factors,10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.008,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) combine an electric drive train with a conventional one and are able to drive on gasoline when the battery is fully depleted. They can thus electrify many vehicle miles travelled (VMT) without fundamental range limits. The most important variable for the electrification potential is the ratio of electric VMT to total VMT, the so-called utility factor (UF). However, the empirical assessment of UFs is difficult since important factors such as daily driving, re-charging behaviour and frequency of long-distance travel vary noteworthy between drivers and large data collections are required. Here, we apply machine learning techniques (regression tree, random forest, support vector machine, and neural nets) to estimate real-world UF and compare the estimates to actual long-term average UF of 1768 individual Chevrolet Volt PHEV. Our results show that UFs can be predicted with high accuracy from individual summary statistics to noteworthy accuracy with a mean absolute error of five percentage points. The accuracy of these methods is higher than a simple simulation with electric driving until the battery is discharged and one full daily recharge. The most important variables in estimating UF according to a linear regression model are the variance and skewness of the daily VMT distributions as well as the frequency of long-distance driving. Thus, our findings make UF predictions from existing data sets for driving of conventional vehicles more accurate.",1361-9209,Not found
Energy consumption and pollutant exposure estimation for cyclist routes in urban areas,10.1016/j.trd.2019.04.005,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"There is a growing effort on policies and projects to support a modal shift towards active transport modes, namely the bicycle. The selection of preferred routes, and consequently the implementation of cycle routes, are usually based on distance, time and safety, not on exposure to pollutants. This paper presents a methodology to compare alternative routes, considering not only journey distance and time but also cyclist effort and exposure to pollutants mainly from traffic emissions (that also relates to the cyclist effort). The main purpose of this work is to develop a simple tool that allows municipalities and end users to estimate the effort required and the exposure to pollutants on potential routes, therefore supporting planning and design of infrastructure. The concept of cyclist specific effort (CSE) is developed in this work. The cyclist's highest specific ventilation rates are estimated from a direct relationship with the CSE, based on the specific characteristics of the users and on a calibrated relationship in the lab. A case study is presented for the route that connects two campuses of the University of Coimbra, Portugal (≈5 km). Results show that some alternative routes, which are generally not considered due to the increment of distance and/or time, can significantly reduce exposure to pollutants while requiring the same or even less effort. A reduction of approximately one third in the inhalation of pollutants from traffic emissions (33.1%) is possible by choosing a slightly longer route (6%) and requires a similar total effort.",1361-9209,Not found
Origin and speciation of major and trace PM elements in the barcelona subway system,10.1016/j.trd.2019.03.007,72,2019-07-01,2019,7,"Wear in train and rail components in the Barcelona subway system includes brake pads, catenary wires, wheels, railways, and motor brushes. These components were characterised to evaluate their contribution to ambient particulate matter (PM) levels in two platforms (conventional F-L3 and new S-L9). The observed chemical compositions of these components were used to interpret the mineralogical, chemical, and leachability patterns of subway platform particulate matter (PM). The use of sulphides such as molybdenite (MoS2), pyrite (FeS2), stibnite Sb2S3) rich in toxic elements such as in Cu, Ni, As, Hg, Cd, and Pb and abrasives such barite (BaSO4) and zinzite (ZnO) in the brake pad composition, the composition of the catenary rich in Cu (98% metallic-Cu) with traces of Hg and that of the wheel/rail (98% metallic-Fe) with traces of As results in the production of fine PM particles of As, Hg, Cu, and Sb in ambient air PM in platform as a consequence of the abrasion/friction and sparking processes. The temperature reached in the aforementioned processes give rise to fine condensed and water-soluble As species (most likely As2O3 and As2O5). Moreover, the stibnite (Sb2S3) Hg-rich lateral brake pads used in L9 also contribute to fine and relatively soluble Sb and Hg oxides. Sulphide-rich brake pads significantly increase and change the occurrence mode of the Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr, Pb, and Ni present in PM by oxidation of brake-bearing metal sulphide to relatively water-soluble sulphate and oxide species. These changes in the mode of occurrence and speciation of elements in the PM of subway platforms points to the need for in-depth PM speciation studies, as well as the need for substituting conventional friction materials with low-metal materials—such as graphite pantographs/catenaries and rubber wheels and low toxic sulphides in brake pads—to reduce exposure to metals during subway commuting.",1361-9209,Not found

We worked with ungulate-vehicle collisions which took place on the Czech road network in the period 2014–2016 using the application Srazenazver.cz. With the KDE+ method, we chose the most significant hotspots with linkage to forest. For comparison we randomly selected control localities outside the KDE+ hotspots (i.e., with very low level of ungulate-vehicle collisions) but still in the forest area. A set of photos were taken at each hotspot and control locality (2 orthophotos and 4 driver views). Each set of images was then visually analysed by two independent evaluators. They did not know which set of images were for hotspots and which set of images were for control localities. From the point of view of the overall score, it cannot be said that these two groups of locations differ (p-value 0.3575, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The only attribute that demonstrated a difference between hotspots and randomly selected locations was “attractiveness (quality food source and cover) of the immediate vicinity of the transport infrastructure for the ungulates” (p-value 0.0016, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Results confirm the importance of landscape management in the surroundings of transport infrastructure, especially in its immediate vicinity. However, they did not confirm the possibility that the most dangerous locations from the UVC point of view could be identified on the basis of landscape composition and the overall state of vegetation around transport infrastructure.",1361-9209,Not found
Do residential location effects on travel behavior differ between the elderly and younger adults?,10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.015,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The built environment affects individuals’ travel behavior in a variety of dimensions, such as trip generation, mode choice, and travel duration. However, it is not well understood how these effects differ across different socioeconomic groups (e.g. the elderly versus younger adults) and how residential self-selection contributes to these differences. Using the 2013 Nanjing (China) Travel Survey data, this study estimates the differential responsiveness to the variation in residential location for different age groups. The two-step clustering method is applied to characterize two types of residential locations and the propensity score matching approach is utilized to address self-selection effects. We find that, after control for self-selection, residential location effects on travel behavior differ significantly between the elderly (60+ years old) and younger respondents (18–59 years old). Changes in the living environment play a more important role in influencing the elderly’s travel frequency and travel duration than those of younger adults. When we compare the observed effects of residential location, self-selection effects are modest for the elderly while they matter to a great extent for younger adults. In addition, due to differences in residential self-selection, there is an underestimation of residential location effects on the elderly’s travel behavior versus an overestimation of those for younger adults. These findings indicate that overlooking the variation of built environment effects between different age groups may lead to ineffective housing and transportation policy implications.",1361-9209,Not found
Evaluation of scenarios for improving energy efficiency and reducing exhaust emissions of a passenger car fleet: A methodology,10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.005,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Improvement of energy efficiency and exhaust emissions reduction are environmental targets of utmost importance in the transport and traffic sectors. The literature suggests that there is a need for the development of a general methodology that can be used to evaluate and compare scenarios for the reduction of the environmental impact caused by fossil-fuel usage of passenger car fleet. We develop such a methodology, which assesses the external costs of four combustion products (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons) as well as fuel consumption costs. In this study, we applied this methodology to evaluate and compare five scenarios. The methodology was tested for the case of the Serbian passenger car fleet. Serbia was selected as a country with the passenger car fleet primarily consisted of fossil-fuelled passenger cars. In addition, Serbia is a country in which rising demand for cars is met through the import of second-hand cars. We found that the only scenario which could result in a positive solution of the given problem is the “reduction of the total number of passenger cars in the fleet of a country” scenario. Moreover, the purchase of new cars and import of second-hand cars cannot result in significant positive effects. The results obtained for the case of Serbia can provide an important insight into the environmental effects of passenger car fleets for countries primarily using fossil-fuelled cars, in which the demand for cars is met mostly through the import of second-hand cars.",1361-9209,Not found

The model incorporates the effect of the currently owned vehicle (status quo) and future vehicles with different performance and market situations on consumers’ current purchase decisions. By identifying purchase timing, the model endogenously identifies new vehicle buyers for each period and derives the expected sales and stock share of the market. Choice experiments were conducted among 333 South Korean vehicle owners in 2018, and the results were applied to a simulation framework to forecast the future vehicle market (2018–2030). The proposed model showed significantly different results compared to models that ignored the effects of status quo and future vehicles on current purchase decisions. The key findings are as follows. First, consumers tend to prefer the same vehicle type as their status quo vehicle. Second, consumers tend to postpone their purchase of electric vehicles more than they do in the case of conventional vehicles, and they may delay or advance their purchase to the start or end of policies.

Measuring the potential emission reductions from a shift towards public transport,10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.010,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The research presented in this paper investigates the behavioural response and subsequent appraisal of a range of policy incentives devised to encourage greater use of sustainable travel options within the Greater Dublin Area (GDA). Interventions were assessed by employing four-stage modelling techniques, as a tool to identify signs of mode shifting behaviour from single occupancy vehicle (SOV) use to public transport modes. Extensive modelling work was conducted in collaboration with the National Transport Authority (NTA) of Ireland utilising the National Regional Modelling System (RMS) to represent the sustainable policy changes. Parameter modifications in the mode and destination choice and trip assignment stages were made to account for improvements made to frequency, time and cost attributes of public transport modes included in the model. Subsequent changes in vehicle kilometres travelled of various modes modelled were then utilised to estimate the potential emissions savings. In addition to this, the potential monetary savings generated from a reduction in emissions were calculated. The key results produced from this study found that an increase in the mode share of public transport of up to 2.87% could be achieved in the GDA. Up to 1.76% of which was estimated to come directly from private car trips, as a result of implementing the policy incentives tested.

Assessment of post-disaster reentry traffic in megaregions using agent-based simulation,10.1016/j.trd.2019.06.010,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Transportation personnel, assets, and systems play important roles during emergencies. Of particular note is the critical function of road networks as lifelines for evacuations, then, after such events, to facilitate the rapid inflow of support personnel and resources needed to assess and repair damage. They also provide access for the safe and rapid return of evacuees. Despite the importance of reentry and repopulation, the role of transportation systems for them has been a relatively lightly researched topic. This paper describes research to analyze the traffic processes associated with post-evacuation reentry and its associated travel time and delay. To examine the most extreme of conditions; this effort also focused on repopulation and reentry after mass evacuations in megaregions. Among the findings of this work were that, as expected, reentry traffic processes generally behave similar to, but in the reverse direction, of evacuations. However, contrary to commonly held belief, they are not identically opposite. Rather, network performance during reentry may often be better than that of evacuation. Another broad finding of the research was that the spatial heterogeneity of traffic distribution across available roadways is a primary factor in determining network performance, meaning the more uniform the spread of on all links, the more efficient the network will operate. A third significant finding of this research was also the importance of the temporal spreading of returnee departure times on network efficiency.",1361-9209,Not found
Polycentric urban form and non-work travel in Singapore: A focus on seniors,10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.003,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,This study explores how the planned polycentric urban form in Singapore influences local residents’ non-work trip frequency of different transport modes and how the travel impacts of access to the planned commercial/activity centers vary between the non-elderly adults (aged 20–54) and older adults (aged 55 and over) of different subgroups. The study applies a categorical variable approach to account for independent effects of aging and its interaction effects with urban form variables while controlling for neighborhood-scale land use characteristics. The results indicate that better access to different tiers of planned urban centers is associated with more walking trips for some age groups of older people but less walking trips for other age groups. Neighborhood-level land use characteristics such as higher density and better street connectivity significantly increase walking trips for all adults with no differential effects across age. This study provides new empirical evidence on the differential travel impacts of urban form between younger adults and older adults of different subgroups. The findings also provide some insights on evaluating the performance of polycentric urban development strategy and land use policies of Singapore in terms of facilitating local residents’ daily mobility.,1361-9209,Not found
A statistical operating cycle description for prediction of road vehicles’ energy consumption,10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.006,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"We propose a novel statistical description of the physical properties of road transport operations by using stochastic models arranged in a hierarchical structure.

Methods are described how to generate data on a form (the operating cycle format) that can be used in dynamic simulations to estimate energy usage and CO2 emissions. To showcase the behaviour of the description, two examples are presented using a modular vehicle model for a heavy-duty truck: a sensitivity study on impacts from changes in the environment, and a comparison study on a real goods transport operation with respect to energy usage. It is found that the stop intensity and topography amplitude have the greatest impact in the sensitivity study (8.3% and 9.5% respectively), and the comparison study implies that the statistical description is capable of capturing properties of the road that are significant for vehicular energy usage.

Several studies have argued that energy efficiency measures for virtual arrival and associated reduced anchorage time can significantly reduce emissions from ships by allowing for speed reduction on passage. However, virtual arrival is uncommon in shipping. In this paper, we examine the causes for waiting time for ships at anchor and the limited uptake of virtual arrival. We show the difficulties associated with the implementation of virtual arrival and explain why shipping is unlikely to achieve the related abatement potential as assumed by previous studies. Combining onboard observations with seafarers and interviews with both sea-staff and shore-based operational personnel we show how charterers’ commercial priorities outweigh the fuel saving benefits associated with virtual arrival. Moreover, we demonstrate how virtual arrival systems have unintended, negative consequences for seafarers in the form of fatigue.

Carsharing adopters own less cars, ride less car kilometers and depend on multiple transportation modes for their travel needs. There has been considerable interest in understanding the characteristics and motives of carsharing adopters. Yet, studies have been mostly limited to small-scale surveys, covering only specific cities or organizations and focusing on traditional B2C carsharing, disregarding the growing popularity of P2P carsharing through online platforms. This study contributes to extant research by investigating whether characteristics and motives differ between B2C and P2P carsharing adopters, and broadening the scope of the analysis to include an entire country (The Netherlands) and different carsharing provider types. First, our findings suggest that B2C and P2P carsharing adopters are rather similar in their characteristics but differ in the frequency in which they make use of carsharing and public transport. Second, we provide novel insights into the characteristics that influence a car owner to become an adopter of P2P carsharing as a provider. We find that car owners who already shared their car informally outside an online platform are also much more likely to provide their car through an online platform. We conclude with describing policy implications of our findings. Regulation should focus on shaping favorable conditions for a connected multi-modal transportation system instead of specific regulations for each carsharing business model.",1361-9209,Not found

The travel data were collected from an activity diary survey in rural Sichuan. Geographic information system technology, combined with on-site measurement, was used to obtain data on the built environment. After controlling the socio-demographic factors, the model results corroborate that all built environment variables had significant total effects on car ownership, travel distance, travel frequency, and travel emissions. Specifically, residents living in the village with more accessible markets, higher roads, and higher building density travel a shorter distance and emit less CO2. Meanwhile, residents living in the village with centralized living style and higher transit and destination accessibility travel less frequently but emit more CO2. Individual travel attitudes have a limited effect on travel behavior and CO2 emissions. This study suggests that planners and policymakers should consider shortening the distance between destination/transit and residential areas and increasing road and building densities. Moreover, promoting the construction of bicycling facilities and separate bicycle lanes to encourage rural residents to ride electric bicycles, bicycles, and motorcycles will reduce transport CO2 emission in Chinese rural areas.",1361-9209,Not found

Therefore, this study is conducted from business perspective that how the global container shipping sector can create value to its customers and stakeholders and also go tandem with environmental aspect. The objective of the study is to identify and examine the value creating factors and sub-factors of GMSCs of containerized freight. Data on value creating factors is collected by consulting 57 ports and shipping industry experts globally. We propose FAHP (Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process) framework for evaluating these value creating factors and develop this study which will not just help carriers but also the stakeholders in the containerized freight transport industry to measure their competitive edge over rivals. This study concludes with sensitivity analysis, results and discussions, managerial and practical implications of the conceptual framework.",1361-9209,Not found
Evaluation of environmental performance indices for ships,10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.002,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Pollution from ships is a significant environmental concern. Maritime environmental legislation has tightened in recent years since the introduction of the MARPOL 73/78 regulations, however there is often a significant time gap between when the regulations are adopted and when they legally enter force. The emergence of private voluntary environmental initiatives has occurred in an attempt to bridge this gap, reduce environmental impacts, and raise the environmental profile of ships. However, there are inconsistencies in the methodologies used to define ship performance, and the number and diversity of initiatives available for use can cause confusion, hindering progress towards greater sustainability. A critical analysis of existing environmental initiatives in the shipping industry has been conducted, challenging the applicability, scope, and environmental ambition of the methodologies adopted. The analysis highlights significant limitations of initiatives with regards to transparency, assessment rationale and environmental scope, and flexibility to be ship specific. Many show bias towards certain environmental indicators, while others have limited ambition. This paper challenges the effectiveness of existing environmental initiatives used in the shipping sector to promote environmental improvements beyond current regulatory requirements, and proposes an objective, quantifiable approach to assessing vessel environmental performance.",1361-9209,Not found
"Deep decarbonization from electrified autonomous taxi fleets: Life cycle assessment and case study in Austin, TX",10.1016/j.trd.2019.06.007,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Although recent studies of autonomous taxis (ATs) have begun to explore potential environmental implications of fleet deployment, little is known about their impacts over the long term. We present a life-cycle assessment framework that incorporates both direct and indirect effects of ATs at the subsystem, vehicle, and mobility-system levels. Eco-driving and intersection connectivity are the direct effects analyzed along with indirect effects that include empty kilometers, parking, charging infrastructure, powertrain rightsizing, electric vehicle adoption, ride-sharing, and fleet-turnover rates. A case study of an AT fleet in Austin, Texas from 2020 to 2050 with constant travel demand indicates the strategic deployment of an electrified AT fleet can reduce cumulative energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 60% in the base case, with a majority of this benefit resulting from electrified powertrains. Further reductions up to 87% can be achieved with accelerated electrical grid decarbonization, dynamic ride-share, longer vehicle lifetime, more energy efficient computer systems, and faster fuel efficiency improvements for new vehicles. We highlight the major opportunities for maximizing the environmental performance of AT fleets over the long term.",1361-9209,Not found
Quantifying the impacts of dynamic control in connected and automated vehicles on greenhouse gas emissions and urban NO<inf>2</inf> concentrations,10.1016/j.trd.2019.06.008,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Communication between vehicles and road infrastructure can enable more efficient use of the road network and hence reduce congestion in urban areas. This improvement can be enhanced by distributed control due to its lighter computational load and higher reliability. Despite favourable impacts on traffic, little is known about the effects of such systems on near-road air quality. In this study, an End-To-End (E2E) dynamic distributed routing algorithm in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) was applied in downtown Toronto, to identify whether benefits to network throughput were associated with lower near-road NO2 concentrations. We observe significant reductions in the emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) with increased penetration of CAVs. Nonetheless, at times, the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) increased with higher CAVs. Besides, a higher frequency and severity of NO2 hot-spots were observed under a 100% CAV scenario. Impacts of the proposed system on electric energy consumption in a full electric vehicle network were also investigated, indicating that the addition of CAVs that are electric did not contribute to high energy savings. We propose that such new transformative technologies in transportation should be designed with air pollution and public health goals.",1361-9209,Not found
How many fast-charging stations do we need along European highways?,10.1016/j.trd.2019.06.005,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"For a successful market take-up of plug-in electric vehicles, fast-charging stations along the highway network play a significant role. This paper provides results from a first study on estimating the minimum number of fast-charging stations along the European highway network of selected countries (i.e., France, Germany, the Benelux countries, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, the Czech Republic, and Poland) and gives an estimate on their future profitability. The combination of a comprehensive dataset of passenger car trips in Europe and an efficient arc-cover-path-cover flow-refueling location model allows generating results for such a comprehensive transnational highway network for the first time. Besides the minimum number of required fast-charging stations which results from the applied flow-refueling location model (FRLM), an estimation of their profitability as well as some country-specific results are also identified. According to these results the operation of fast-charging stations along the highway will be attractive in 2030 because the number of customers per day and their willingness to pay for a charge is high compared to inner-city charging stations. Their location-specific workloads as well as revenues differ significantly and a careful selection of locations is decisive for their economic operation.",1361-9209,Not found
Factors affecting the purchasing decision and operation of alternative fuel-powered heavy-duty trucks in Germany – A Delphi study,10.1016/j.trd.2019.06.003,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The transport sector is the third-largest producer of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Germany, but within the scope of the government’s climate action plan, the country aims to cut emissions from transport by at least 40% by 2030. Apart from passenger cars, commercial vehicles including heavy-duty trucks (HDTs) are one of the main contributors of emissions. Eco-innovations such as alternative fuel-powered HDTs could change that but diesel is still by far the prevalent fuel of choice. Hence, what factors affect the purchasing decision and operation of low-emission HDTs and which are the most relevant ones? We employed a Delphi study to answer the question of how 34 factors affect the adoption of alternative fuel-powered HDTs in Germany. Our factors combine cost factors, socioeconomic issues, environmental criteria, operational aspects, and political considerations. According to the experts, a truck’s reliability, an available fueling/charging infrastructure, the possibility to enter low-emission zones as well as current and future fuel costs are key factors when purchasing and operating an alternative fuel-powered HDT. In addition, we identified battery electric (BE), fuel cell electric (FCE), compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) as promising technologies to reduce emissions from HDTs. Thus, we analyzed motivators, barriers, and ways to overcome the main barriers when switching from diesel to those technologies. Among others, the experts evaluated the possibility to enter low-emission zones as an important motivator, but the fragmented fueling/charging infrastructure as a main barrier. Subsidies are one promising way to spur the penetration of low-emission HDTs.",1361-9209,Not found
Development of an integrated modelling-measurement system for near-real-time estimates of harbour activity impact to atmospheric pollution in coastal cities,10.1016/j.trd.2019.06.009,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Several studies focused on harbour impact on air quality of port-cities showing that maritime emissions could be comparable to traffic emissions of a medium-size town having relevant impact on air quality nearby the harbours. In order to plan efficient mitigation strategies, environmental and port authorities have an increasing need of reliable tools for investigating the impact of ships traffic and harbour logistics on atmospheric pollutants. In this work a system based on the integration of measurements collected using a network of low-cost on-line sensors with local scale dispersion modelling was developed. It was implemented, as a pilot action, in the information and management software of the Bari harbour (SE Italy). It can operate in near-real-time, in forecast mode, and on archived data for long-term assessments. It was tested studying the impact of the Bari harbour for the year 2018. The lowest impact was observed for CO, being the pollutant with the lowest share of the contribution of ships (between 8% and 68%) compared with the total harbour contribution. The impacts on PM2.5 and PM10 are larger arriving up to 11.8% of concentrations in the harbour area with an influence of shipping between 44% and 97%. The impact on SO2 is almost solely due to ships and it arrives up to 80% in the harbour area. The impact on NOX ranges from a few percent in the urban area up to 40% in the harbour area and it is the pollutant of major concern regarding compliance with air quality standards.",1361-9209,Not found
Representing vehicle-technological opportunities in integrated energy modeling,10.1016/j.trd.2019.06.006,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Light-duty vehicles (LDVs) are responsible for more than one tenth of global energy use and CO2 emissions and are therefore an important focus in pollution mitigation efforts. Integrated energy models (IEMs) are frequently used to explore cost-optimal climate change mitigation measures for energy supply and demand sectors, such as LDVs. Options include fuel and powertrain switching through efficiency standards, taxation, and technology mandates. This review provides an overview on how LDVs are modeled in 14 popular IEMs. We find that the representation of mitigation options can be enhanced by linking emissions and physical outputs from industry, agriculture, and energy conversion directly to the vehicle life cycle and by more carefully reflecting important factors that influence LDV life cycle emissions. This would allow for a more complete internalization of emissions in the technology mix optimization procedure of IEMs. The results highlight a range of mitigation options currently not considered in most integrated models, such as reducing embodied emissions in infrastructure and vehicle production, reducing methane leakage, or switching to less carbon intensive crude oil grades.",1361-9209,Not found
Supporting green transportation with transport impact assessment: Its deficiency in Chinese cities,10.1016/j.trd.2019.06.004,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Transport Impact Assessment (TIA) is one of the promising tools used by many city governments around the world to manage the transport impacts of land development, but how it has been implemented in Chinese cities is rarely studied.

Our research reveals that the TIA process enables local planning authorities to better cope with the traffic externalities stemming from various development projects, and to secure resources in advance for green transport modes. However, the effectiveness of this policy tool still falls short in how governments prioritize green transportation and in implementation details.

Emissions vs exposure: Increasing injustice from road traffic-related air pollution in the United Kingdom,10.1016/j.trd.2019.05.012,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"This paper presents unique spatial analyses identifying substantial discrepancies in traffic-related emissions generation and exposure by socioeconomic and demographic groups. It demonstrates a compelling environmental and social injustice narrative with strong policy implications for the UK and beyond. In the first instance, this research presents a decadal update for England and Wales to Mitchell and Dorling’s 2003 analysis of environmental justice in the UK. Using 2011 UK Government pollution and emissions data with 2011 UK Census socioeconomic and demographic data based on small area census geographies, this paper demonstrates a stronger relationship between age, poverty, road NOx emissions and exposure to NO2 concentrations. Areas with the highest proportions of under-fives and young adults, and poorer households, have the highest concentrations of traffic-related pollution. In addition, exclusive access to UK annual vehicle safety inspection records (‘MOT’ tests) allowed annual private vehicle NOx emissions to be spatially attributed to registered keepers. Areal analysis against Census-based socioeconomic characteristics identified that households in the poorest areas emit the least NOx and PM, whilst the least poor areas emitted the highest, per km, vehicle emissions per household through having higher vehicle ownership, owning more diesel vehicles and driving further. In conclusion, the analysis indicates that, despite more than a decade of air quality policy, environmental injustice of air pollution exposure has worsened. New evidence regarding the responsibility for generation of road traffic emissions provides a clear focus for policy development and targeted implementation.",1361-9209,Not found
Removal effect on stormwater runoff pollution of porous concrete treated with nanometer titanium dioxide,10.1016/j.trd.2019.06.001,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Development of the cities is facing many problems; one of them is runoff water pollution. On the other hand, some technologies have been applied to remove water pollution such as the photocatalytic effect method using nano-titanium dioxide (nTiO2). That technology exhibited a significant effect to remove various pollutants from runoff water. The use of nTiO2 on porous concrete (TPC) considers a new technology, which is effective and clean technology to deal with the non-point source pollution. In this paper, the permeability, mechanical properties and water purification capacity of using that technology have been investigated to analyze the environmental effect of TPC. In addition, this study tested the environmental impact using zebrafish aquatic toxicity and alkali dissolution experimentally. Moreover, the photocatalytic oxidation reaction of TPC is exploited to detect the purification effects of three typical pollutants, i.e., methylene blue, total phosphorus, and ammonia nitrogen. At the same time, three different application methods with three different concentrations of nTiO2 have been utilized in the porous concrete to obtain the optimum value. The removal effectiveness in pollutants is also measured, moreover the purification durability effectiveness is tested. After culturing the zebrafish embryos in the leachate of porous concrete with nTiO2, the hatching rate was 91.7%, which proved that this technology has little aquatic toxicity to organism and environment. The capacity of pollutants removing was effective and reached up to 60%-90%. Besides, porous concrete treated by nTiO2 that was placed in actual weather for a month showed a half reduction in water purification effect.",1361-9209,Not found
Real driving emissions of a scooter and a passenger car in Naples city,10.1016/j.trd.2019.06.002,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"The aim of the study was to investigate the real driving emissions of two vehicles widely used as private means of transport in Italian cities: a Euro 4 gasoline passenger car and a Euro 3 scooter. Exhaust emissions of two and four wheel vehicles were characterised over three urban routes in Naples. On-board measurement of CO, NOx, CO2 and fuel consumption of the car was made with a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS); exhaust emissions of NOx and fuel consumption of the scooter were measured in the laboratory, reproducing speed profiles acquired on the road on a chassis-dynamometer. In both cases, vehicle spatial position was acquired by Global Positioning System (GPS) at a frequency of 10 Hz. Real vehicle speed and acceleration together with road gradient were used to evaluate the specific power of the vehicle (VSP) and the results were modelled so as to correlate emissions with driving activities. Specific emissions and fuel consumption were also analysed as a function of road gradient. The most critical results for the car concerned NOx emissions which greatly exceeded the type-approval limit, and real driving of the scooter involved a significant increase in fuel consumption. For both vehicles, positive road gradient greatly influenced fuel demand, while NOx and CO emissions were considerably reduced on downhill stretches.",1361-9209,Not found
Optimizing the electric range of plug-in vehicles via fuel economy simulations of real-world driving in California,10.1016/j.trd.2019.05.013,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"This paper presents a modeling and simulation study of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of plug-in vehicles subject to real-world driving conditions. The simulations utilize open-source software tools for estimation of second-by-second energy and/or fuel consumption in more than 65 thousand real-world recorded trips in the California household travel survey (CHTS) data set. Statistical distributions of the equivalent well-to-wheels (W2W) GHG emissions corresponding to CHTS trips are generated for three baseline public-domain plug-in vehicle models of: (i) parallel-drive plug-in hybrid, (ii) serial-drive plug-in hybrid, and (iii) pure electric vehicle. In addition to the baseline models, several derived vehicle models are created by upsizing of the battery and powertrain via an iterative procedure to attain the new all-electric range (AER). The emissions model also considers days when a pure electric vehicle cannot meet the travel demand by assuming that the driving on those days is done on a conventional vehicle. For each of the considered powertrain architectures, optimizing the AER for minimum GHG emissions becomes a trade-off between reducing the gasoline driven miles and maintaining reasonably sized (lightweight) powertrain components. As such, the equivalent GHG emissions of a vehicle are shown to have diminishing returns in terms of AER, and the optimum AER depends on both the carbon content in the electric grid, as well as the charging behavior. Within considered modeling assumptions and several vehicle usage conditions, the optimum AER is estimated to be between 30 and 60 miles for PHEVs, and between 120 and 200 miles for BEVs.",1361-9209,Not found

A data collection campaign was conducted between March and July 2018 whereby 82 research participants were recruited to record daily driving behaviors in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) for a period of one week. A drive cycle construction methodology was employed to build representative drive cycles based on micro-trips. The constructed drive cycles were compared with the interpolated drive cycles derived from the default database of the USEPA MOVES model. The results indicate that the MOVES default opmode distributions lead to higher average-speed EFs than the ones derived from local data. The difference between two drive cycle construction methods was also evaluated by comparing the variability in opmode distributions and the resulting average speed EFs. We observed that EFs were similar within each speed category, and the variation in cumulative opmode distributions was highest for an average speed of 40 mph. Moreover, a Monte Carlo Simulation was conducted to generate EF distributions based on local opmodes, further illustrating that local drive cycles generated significantly lower emission estimates than those based on the default database of MOVES. Finally, the minimum number of GPS data points required to develop a local opmode database with adequate variability was determined, illustrating that 4400–19,300 s were needed to generate robust distributions for different speed categories and road types.",1361-9209,Not found
Exploring urban rail transit station-level ridership growth with network expansion,10.1016/j.trd.2018.04.006,73,2019-08-01,2019,8,"Urban rail transit (URT) is experiencing rapid network expansion in metropolises in China. The network expansion not only improves accessibility, but also motivates the surrounding land use development, which may have important effects on the ridership of existing stations. Considering the network scale, station-level accessibility increment, station characteristics, etc., this study develops an approach to explore the URT station-level ridership growth with network expansion, which can provide transit resource allocation guidance for URT agencies. Instead of collecting land use and socioeconomic data with huge labor and cost, we make good use of Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) data to develop proxy variables. Based on the temporal distribution of station-level ridership, a proxy for land use type is proposed. Then, multiple explanatory variables representing network expansion are introduced, and further the multivariate regression models are established to explore station-level ridership growth with network topology change and surrounding land use development. The results show that the proposed approach has good abilities to explain station-level ridership growth with network expansion and can make a response to network topology change and surrounding land use change.",1361-9209,Not found
A decision support model for risk management of hazardous materials road transportation based on quality function deployment,10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.026,74,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Risk management of hazardous materials (hazmats) road transportation has long been a concern because of the potential hazards that poses to society and the environment. In this work, a systematic and semi-quantitative decision support framework for risk management of hazmats road transportation based on the combination of quality function deployment (QFD), fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP), fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis (F-FMEA), and nonlinear goal programming is proposed. The QFD is used innovatively to construct the overall framework, which contains three main components of general risk management: risk identification, risk assessment, and risk control. The F-AHP is used to build a hierarchical risk assessment system and determine the importance rating of each risk factor. The F-FMEA is used to evaluate the potential risks of risk control measures and determine the risk adjustment coefficient of each risk measure, which is used subsequently to modify the fulfillment level of risk measure in the nonlinear goal programming model. To address the inherent vagueness and uncertainty contained in the risk management process, the fuzzy set theory is introduced as an effective tool. An empirical case on risk management of a hazmats transportation company is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed methodology.

Effects of ambient temperature on the route planning of electric freight vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.025,74,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Electric freight vehicles have strong potential to reduce emissions stemming from logistics operations; however, their limited range still causes critical limitations. Range anxiety is directly related to the total amount of energy consumed during trips. There are several operational factors that affect the energy consumption of electric vehicles and should be considered for accurate route planning. Among them, ambient temperature arises as a key factor because cabin heating or cooling may significantly increase the energy discharged from the battery during the trip and reduce the driving range. Additionally, cold temperatures decrease the battery efficiency and cause performance losses. In this study, we investigate the effect of ambient temperature on the fleet composition, energy consumption, and routing decisions in last-mile delivery operations. First, we present the mathematical programming formulation of the problem. Next, we perform an extensive computational study based on benchmark data from the literature. For solving the small-size instances we use a commercial solver. For solving the large-size instances we employ an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm. Our results show that the route plans made without considering the ambient temperature effect may lead to inefficient operations and disruptions. Specifically, the fleet size and energy consumption can increase by 46% and 81%, respectively, in small-size problems on average due to ambient temperature whereas the average increase can reach 15% and 68%, respectively, in large-size problems.

Hence, it is important to know that a distribution company how many and what types of vehicles do need to predict the fuel consumption of these vehicles. Extra fuel consumption may be required owing to carry unnecessary equipment or used vehicles with large engine volume. Therefore, in this paper, the fuel consumption levels of outage elimination maintenance, maintenance, and supervision vehicles are considered. Then, given the fact that fuel consumption increases with the increase of vehicle weight and Engine Displacement (ED), the extra fuel consumption has been predicted using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In a case study, the total annual fuel cost in the network under consideration is estimated to be $66750. In the case of a 40% increase in vehicle weight, the fuel consumption cost will rise by $24500, and when the engine displacement increases for a 500 CC, the cost rises up $17400 per year.",1361-9209,Not found

Using 7,774 individual samples across China, this study employs a multilevel ordered logit model to examine how commuting time is correlated with residents’ happiness. The effects of both the neighborhood and city-level built environment are revealed. Our findings show that commuting time is an essential factor correlated with residents’ happiness and the correlation varies across urbanization levels. People from cities with high urbanization rates (>70%) have a strong mental endurance of commuting time, whereas commuting time is more influential on residents’ happiness in cities with low urbanization rates (<50%). For the effects of the built environment, residents’ happiness is significantly associated with both levels of built environment in cities with urbanization rates higher than 50%. Conversely, residents’ happiness is only significantly correlated with the neighborhood built environment in cities with urbanization rates lower than 50%.

Several market-based measures have been proposed and submitted to IMO for discussion and evaluation. In this paper, we focus on one of these measures, namely the Maritime Emissions Trading Scheme (METS). An optimization model that integrates (global or regional) METS into the classical fleet composition and deployment problem is proposed. This model is used as a tool to study the impact of METS on fleet operations and their CO2 emissions. The results of the computational study suggest that, in the short term, the implementation of METS does not lead to emission reduction in most scenarios.

Two methods of estimating long-distance driving to understand range restrictions on EV use,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.008,74,2019-09-01,2019,9,"The distances travelled by individual cars vary strongly from day to day. This is problematic for electric vehicles since they cannot be used for journeys longer than the all-electric range. At present, long-distance travel is rarely covered by household travel surveys and little is known about the frequency of long-distance car travel on an individual car basis. Here, two methods are compared that estimate the number of days per year with a driving distance larger than a given threshold: a simulation method and a probabilistic method. The simulation method combines a national household travel survey, a car-use survey and a long-distance travel survey and simulates one year of car driving; the resolution of results is car trips over a full year. The probabilistic method uses statistical distribution to estimate the number of days per year with long-distance travel. Both methods are tested on a representative one-week sample of the German Mobility Panel with travel data from over 6000 cars. Our results show that both methods produce similar aggregated results for the distribution of days with long-distance car travel, the maximum mileages, and average long-distance travel frequencies amongst user groups. However, the two methods differ on the level of individual cars.

Public perceptions of electric vehicles and vehicle-to-grid (V2G): Insights from a Nordic focus group study,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.006,74,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Public awareness and acceptance of electric vehicles (EVs) are essential components to catalyse a faster uptake of more sustainable passenger transport as well as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mobility. As such, public perceptions are central to decarbonize transportation and help capture the co-benefits of reduced local pollution, noise emissions, and oil dependency. However, we observe that the general public is often treated statically and seen as either problematic or peripheral to questions within the transport and energy studies communities. This paper asks two questions. First, given increasing adoption in the Nordic region, how do ordinary members of the public perceive EVs? And second, how do they perceive V2G? With these questions, the paper offers an international and in-depth assessment of public perceptions of EVs and V2G systems across five Nordic countries using original data drawn from eight focus groups. We find eight themes of relevance for future research and policy. These include often discussed insights like an EV’s environmental sustainability, range, charging or price, but also insights around themes like social status, sound, and acceleration. Additionally, we asked the participants whether V2G strengthens (or weakens) the desirability of EVs.

In this study, we first conducted qualitative research to identify relevant factors influencing individual acceptance of autonomously driven electric buses. We then developed a comprehensive research model that was validated through a survey of 268 passengers of an AEB, operated in regular road traffic in Germany. The results indicate that a mix of individual factors, social impacts, and system characteristics determine an individual’s acceptance of AEBs. Notably, it is important that users perceive AEBs, not only as advantageous, but also trustworthy, enjoyable, and in a positive social light.

To characterize these emissions, we define critical parameters regarding fleet composition, activity, efficiency and fuel production in each country. Overall, with today’s technology at a national average level, on a per km driven basis, battery electric vehicles emit fewer greenhouse gases than conventional vehicles in all countries. Though vehicle energy consumption is similar in all countries, electricity production energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions per kWh electricity vary considerably, with Norway and China representing the low and high emitting endpoints, respectively. As electricity generation decarbonizes, EVs have the potential to be lower greenhouse-gas emitting than gasoline vehicles in all countries considered. The complexity of EV analysis across international boundaries, time periods, and environmental media complicates communication of EV benefits to stakeholders. Analysts must continue to address and clearly communicate the influence of EV and electricity production technology advancement into the future on EV impacts on all environmental media (air, water, land).",1361-9209,Not found
Strategy development for retrofitting ships for implementing shore side electricity,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.004,74,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Shore side electricity (SSE) is the use of electricity from the shore to power a ship’s system when it is berthing at ports. It is a solution to reduce the emissions of auxiliary engines at berth and to improve the local and regional air quality. This paper develops a multi-objective model that integrates spatial and temporal dimensions for strategic planning regarding whether and when to retrofit ships to use SSE. The strategic planning problem is to maximize the environmental benefit and to minimize the payback period of the investment over the entire planning horizon. By adopting an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), a series of retrofit strategies for container ships calling at Dalian Port in China are obtained under a projected annual visiting frequency of ships with different ship sizes and shipping lines. Depending on a selected retrofit strategy, the sum of the payback periods of ships that are determined to be retrofitted is 46 years (on average less than four years) and the environmental benefit of using SSE can be up to 128 million USD for Dalian Port in the planning horizon from 2020 to 2035. The results show that using SSE is an efficient method to decline emissions within the maritime sector and validate that the proposed methodology can be useful to ship owners to decide upon investing in SSE applications and to promote the development of green shipping and green ports.",1361-9209,Not found
Carbon Footprint of autonomous vehicles at the urban mobility system level: A traffic simulation-based approach,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.007,74,2019-09-01,2019,9,"This paper presents the results of a Carbon Footprint (CF) study of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and their environmental impact on the transportation network. By assuming that fully AVs are battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with connectivity, light detection and ranging sensors, this study measures the environmental impact at the urban mobility level. The AV complete life cycle impact was firstly evaluated. Next, by comparing the current situation with a future hypothetical scenario (100% AVs penetration), the positive environmental effect of the adoption of AVs on a real road network (city of Rome) is shown. For this scope, a traffic simulation-based approach was used to investigate the effects of AVs on the network congestion. The results show that the full AVs penetration scenario leads to an improvement in the network performances in terms of travel time and average speed. The Total Time Spent (TTS) decreases (−35% for intra-urban roads and −21% for highways), and the average network speed increases (48% for intra-urban road and 37% for highways). Moreover, the final amount of Vehicle Kilometer Traveled (VKT) shows an 8% increase on longer extra-urban routes, due to the higher capacity impact of AVs on highways, with a consequent load reduction for intra-urban shortcutting routes. In terms of life cycle impacts, AVs are characterized by the highest Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions related to construction, maintenance and end-of-life processes (on average 35% compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, 22% compared to hybrid electric vehicles and 5% compared to battery electric vehicles). Nevertheless, a 100% AVs penetration scenario generates a reduction of the environmental impact at the mobility system level of about 60%.",1361-9209,Not found
Young people's travel behavior – Using the life-oriented approach to understand the acceptance of autonomous driving,10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.023,74,2019-09-01,2019,9,"The self-driving public bus (SDPB) holds the potential to replace human-operated driving with more eco-friendly means and is therefore a valuable mobility solution for our future. The SDPB is based on the innovative technology of autonomous driving, which can only be guaranteed future market success with broad enough user acceptance. This acceptance is thus an essential factor for the growth of SDPB services. In this context, the travel behavior of young people is particularly interesting, as its development will continually demonstrate future mobility behavior trends. However, little research has been conducted regarding the best methods for motivating young people to accept SDPBs as a viable mode of travel. To address this topic, we first conducted a literature review, identifying factors that potentially influence SDPB acceptance. Subsequently, we developed a comprehensive research model based on the life-oriented approach and the technology acceptance model. This conceptualization was validated by a survey of 268 SDPB riders in real-world traffic. The results reveal several novel factors influencing the acceptance of SDPBs, in particular regarding differences in age. Our research contributes to existing research on both the life-oriented and travel behavior approaches by highlighting age differences and their importance in the field.

Model-based techno-economic evaluation of fuel cell vehicles considering technology uncertainties,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.002,74,2019-09-01,2019,9,"The future of fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) depends on its cost and performance competitiveness in the automobile market. In this study, we develop a techno-economic analysis framework to compare the cost and performance of major vehicle technologies (internal combustion, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, battery and fuel cell electric) under various progress scenarios for the years 2035 and 2050. We utilize a vehicle powertrain model to compare vehicle technologies with similar engineering performance and evaluate their cost competitiveness. We define the cost as (2018) U.S. dollars per mile driven ($/mile) during a certain ownership period and include the vehicle purchase price and fuel cost. Our results show that, in the 2035 scenarios, the costs per mile for FCEVs are 36% or 22% higher than those of conventional gasoline cars, based on a 5-year or 15-year ownership period, respectively. In the 2050 scenarios, the 15-year ownership costs of FCEVs are comparable to those of gasoline cars with comparable engineering performance. In all the 2035 and 2050 scenarios, fuel cell vehicles have a lower driving cost compared with electric vehicles with 200-mile driving range. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that hydrogen price and fuel cell system cost are the major uncertainties that determine cost competitiveness of FCEVs.",1361-9209,Not found
A trajectory-based energy consumption estimation method considering battery degradation for an urban electric vehicle network,10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.021,74,2019-09-01,2019,9,"As a cost-effective and environmental-friendly transport means, electric vehicle (EV) has received widespread attention in the recent decade. The increasing market share and wider adoption of EV in transportation systems also bring about the energy use issues. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate network-wide EV energy consumption by taking into account battery degradation. We first derive unit energy consumption functions with respect to the battery degradation rate by quadratic regression method using EV operational data in the US. We then put forward an easy-to-implement and tangible method to estimate EV network energy consumption based on EV trajectories and the derived unit energy consumption function. In detail, EVs’ battery degradation rates are assumed to follow a given and known probability distribution and daily travel mileage of each EV is derived from EV trajectories. Based on these, we can get the expected total energy consumption in the network. We also propose a prorated assignment approach to determine the expected energy consumed by EVs through each EV charging point based on the estimated temporal-spatial charging demand distribution from EVs’ trajectories. A case study in Singapore is demonstrated in the end and the importance of incorporating battery degradation is highlighted. The results reveal that overlooking battery degradation would lead to more than 10% of estimation error in energy consumption estimation.",1361-9209,Not found
Non-regulatory parameters effect on consumption and emissions from a diesel-powered van over the WLTC,10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.019,74,2019-09-01,2019,9,"The effect of various non-regulatory parameters on a vehicle’s performance and emissions is investigated in this study, i.e. road grade, presence of crosswinds, surface wetness, tire pressure and use of the vehicle’s auxiliary systems. The vehicle under study is a diesel-powered turbocharged light commercial vehicle, running on the WLTC 3–2 cycle; comparison with the NEDC is also provided. The results derive from a computational code based on an engine-mapping approach applying experimentally derived correction coefficients accounting for transient operation. The engine code is coupled to a vehicle model that calculates the main longitudinal dynamic parameters (tire rolling resistance, aerodynamic performance, gearbox efficiency) on a fundamental basis. Soot and nitrogen monoxide are the examined pollutants, with fuel and energy consumption and CO2 emissions computed and discussed too. From the parameters examined, road grade was found to have the greatest impact on emissions (CO2: +116.8%, NO: +107.2%, Soot: +100.7%, for the maximum road grade examined of 8%), followed by wind speed (CO2: +38.9%, NO: +33.6%, Soot: +12%, for the maximum wind speed examined of 80 km/h). Auxiliary power demand can have a considerable effect, mostly on fuel consumption/CO2 emissions (+13.7% for maximum auxiliary power demand of 5000 W); the impact of tire inflation pressure and surface wetness is comparably smaller. Among the two driving cycles, the WLTC proved to be more ‘sensitive’ to road load changes, due to the broader speed range encompassed and its highly transient nature, compared to the softer NEDC.",1361-9209,Not found

In addition to societal and environmental benefits, such a change should lead to private benefits for households through lower energy expenses, while avoiding the perceived costs that could accompany a modal change in personal transportation (switching away from cars). This paper uses a discrete choice experiment (stated preference) to explore the effects of using alternative fuel cost labels on the demand for more efficient cars. Results show that reframing from fuel consumption (litres) to monthly fuel costs increases the willingness to pay for higher levels of fuel efficiency.

Additionally, we employed the logarithmic mean divisia index method to explore the effect of several factors on the state of decoupling. The results showed that the under-developed provinces were more likely to present a weak decoupling state than the developed and coastal provinces. Income level was the major influential factor limiting the development of decoupling in the transport sector. The population scale had a very small negative role in the development of decoupling. Moreover, the effects of CO2 emissions efficiency, transport intensity and industry structure varied across provinces.

A multi-scale framework for fuel station location: From highways to street intersections,10.1016/j.trd.2019.07.018,74,2019-09-01,2019,9,"Electric drive vehicles (plug-in electric vehicle or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) have been promoted by governments to foster a more sustainable transportation future. Wider adoption of these vehicles, however, depends on the availability of a convenient and reliable refueling/recharging infrastructure. This paper introduces a path-based, multi-scale, scenario-planning modeling framework for locating a system of alternative-fuel stations. The approach builds on (1) the Flow Refueling Location Model (FRLM), which assumes that drivers stop along their origin-destination routes to refuel, and checks explicitly whether round trips can be completed without running out of fuel, and (2) the Freeway Traffic Capture Method (FTCM), which assesses the degree to which drivers can conveniently reach sites on the local street network near freeway intersections. This paper extends the FTCM to handle cases involving clusters of nearby freeway intersections, which is a limitation of its previous specification. Then, the cluster-based FTCM (CFTCM) is integrated with the FRLM and the DFRLM (FRLM with Deviations) to better conduct detailed geographic optimization of this multi-scale location planning problem. The main contribution of this research is the introduction of a framework that combines multi-scale planning methods to more effectively inform the early development stage of hydrogen refueling infrastructure planning.

"The impact of road grade on vehicle accelerations behavior, PM2.5 emissions, and dispersion modeling",10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.006,75,2019-10-01,2019,10,"This study explores the impact of road grade on the acceleration behavior of light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty transit buses on arterials. A piecewise linear model was constructed to estimate the impact of grade on acceleration at various speeds across field-collected second-by-second driving traces. The model results indicate that light-duty vehicles are only slightly impacted by road grade, while a significant decrease of average acceleration is observed for transit bus operations at higher grades, resulting in longer accelerating distances and times for buses to reach a target speed at these higher grades. Given the observed influence of road grade on acceleration behavior, a comparative analysis based on MOVES-Matrix and AERMOD was conducted to examine the impact of ignoring grade, and especially ignoring the grade-acceleration correlation, on the distribution of PM2.5 emissions and dispersion modeling results. Ignoring grade results in a significant under-estimation of PM2.5 emissions on uphill segments, and over-estimation on downhill segments. More interestingly, for heavy-duty buses, ignoring the grade-operation correlation introduces biases in opposite directions at the beginning versus the middle versus ending stages of the acceleration period. Results from this study help improve the understanding of how grade interacts with on-road operations for different vehicle types and supports policy guidance to potentially improve transportation air quality conformity and hot spot analyses, especially at signalized intersections for transit buses, and most likely for heavy-duty trucks.",1361-9209,Not found
Promoting zero-emissions vehicles using robust multi-period tradable credit scheme,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.012,75,2019-10-01,2019,10,"This study designs a robust multi-period tradable credit scheme (TCS) to incentivize travelers to shift from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs) over a long-term planning horizon to reduce vehicular emissions. The need for robust design arises because of uncertainty in forecasting travel demand over a planning horizon in the order of several years. The robust multi-period TCS design is formulated as a bi-level model. In the upper level, the central authority (CA) determines the TCS parameters (credit allocation and charging schemes) by vehicle type to minimize the worst-case vehicular emissions rate, i.e. the maximum vehicular emissions rate under the possible travel demand scenarios. The upper-level model is a mixed-integer nonlinear program. In the lower level, travelers minimize their generalized travel costs under the TCS parameters obtained in the upper level. These parameters are used to determine the vehicle type choice, between ICEVs and ZEVs, using a binomial logit function, and influence route selection based on the difference in credits charged on links for these two vehicle types. The lower-level model is a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints. The bi-level model is solved using a cutting plane method. Numerical experiments illustrate that the incentive to shift to ZEVs is fostered by allocating more credits and charging fewer credits to ZEV travelers compared to ICEV travelers. Further, the proposed TCS design reduces volatility in the realized vehicular emissions rates under different travel demand scenarios compared to a TCS design that does not consider demand uncertainty.",1361-9209,Not found

A modal-based approach for estimating electric vehicle energy consumption in transportation networks,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.001,75,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Electric vehicles (EVs) will play a central role in future energy-efficient and sustainable transportation systems. Compared to the operation of conventional vehicles, EVs provide significantly reduced energy consumption and lower operating costs. With conventional vehicles, fuel use ties directly to the instantaneous energy consumption required to provide motive power to the wheels. Predicting the energy use can be much more complex for EVs with hybridized powertrains because the onboard vehicle systems are trying to balance the provision of power to the wheels as well as manage the state of charge (SOC) of the battery pack. Traditional modeling methodologies for estimating real-world vehicle energy consumption either depend on numerical analysis of laboratory or on-road vehicle test data or the use of full-system simulation tools. Unfortunately, full-system simulation tools suffer from scaling problems in the context of large transportation network, necessitating the development of approaches that support large transportation network projections of modal EV operations and applicable modal energy use rates (energy use for various on-road modes of operation) to predict EV energy consumption. In this study, a new modal-based approach for estimating EV energy consumption is proposed. The modal-based approach considers the variance of vehicle operating conditions and supports energy estimation for large-scale transportation networks. The Department of Energy’s full-system vehicle simulation tool known as Autonomie® is used to generate energy consumption rates for specific simulations of on-road operating conditions. A sample of EV models was first developed in Autonomie® to simulate a wide range of operating conditions and generate energy use rates for selected EVs. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was then applied to the simulation output data to generate energy consumption rates under distinct on-road operating conditions, as represented by combinations of vehicle speed, acceleration rate, and battery state of charge (SOC). A large-scale regional travel demand analysis was performed for the Atlanta, GA metropolitan area, integrating a variety of EV market share scenarios. The CART-derived energy consumption rates are then applied to the model-predicted link-by-link traffic attributes to estimate fleet energy consumption. The modeling framework employs MOVES-embedded driving cycles to represent on-road operations for average speed operating conditions and random initial SOC start levels as model inputs. The model results suggest a 50% PHEV market share can achieve a 30% energy savings without significantly adding to electricity load. This modeling approach can be used to assess network-level energy use for a wide-variety of modeled transportation studies, such as evaluating transportation improvement plans, assessing the net impact on the electric grid, and forecasting the potential benefits of electrifying shared-autonomous vehicles under future scenarios.",1361-9209,Not found

It is a case study, which uses industry data to investigate the impact on climate change, a key driver for electrification, and a wider set of impacts, for average operation in Sweden, the European Union and the United States of America. The results show that non-chargeable hybrid electric vehicles provide clear climate change mitigation potential compared to conventional buses, regardless of the available fuel being diesel or HVO. When fueling with HVO, plug-in hybrid and all-electric buses provide further benefits for grid intensities below 200 g CO2 eq./kWh. For diesel, the all-electric option is preferable up to 750 g CO2 eq./kWh. This is the case despite batteries and other electric powertrain parts causing an increase of CO2 emissions from vehicle production. However, material processing to make common parts, i.e. chassis, frame and body, dominates the production load for all models. Consequently, city buses differ from passenger cars, where the battery packs play a larger role. In regard to other airborne pollutants, the all-electric bus has the best potential to reduce impacts overall, but the results depend on the amount of fossil fuels and combustion processes in the electricity production.

The results showed that under congested conditions the fuel consumption can increase by more than 18% in some cases, indicating the significance of incorporating similar congestion algorithms in macro emission models.

We use the non-parametric mathematical programming technique of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate the frontier. Our novel dataset includes information on CO2 emissions obtained for these Spanish Port Authorities using the fleet activity–based emission estimation (bottom-up) methodology. Using ships berthing as output, if all port authorities had been environmentally efficient in providing their services, CO2 emission could have been reduced to an average of 63% of their actual observed levels with a simultaneous increase in good output. When using cargo and passenger traffic as output in order to control for ship characteristics through the output mix, we find that reductions of emissions to 82% of observed levels could be achieved with simultaneous increases in outputs, and reductions to 72 of existing levels if good outputs remain constant.",1361-9209,Not found
Multimodality and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions: A relationship moderated by distance,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.022,75,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Encouraging multimodality as a tool to reduce exclusive car use is seen as a key ingredient of transport policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gases emissions, such as CO2. These policies are based on the assumption that increasing multimodality will contribute to a reduction in emissions. Yet, hardly any scientific attention has been paid to the empirical relationship between multimodality and CO2 emissions. This article addresses this unexplored question at both the individual and trip level using the English National Travel Survey. We find that the level of multimodality is only weakly associated with CO2 emissions. It is only when controlling for levels of travel activity (trip frequency, total distance travelled) that a moderate association in the expected direction is observed (i.e. that higher levels of multimodality correspond with lower CO2 emissions). This suggests that greater levels of travel activity among multimodals tend to offset the benefits derived from their more diverse modal choices. Similar patterns emerge from the trip-level analyses: higher emissions are found for (the typically longer) multimodal trips compared to unimodal trips, even when the only mode used is the car. However, for trips over similar distances, multimodal trips do have lower emissions. While there is merit in encouraging greater multimodality, this can hardly be the only or primary goal of climate mitigation policies in the transport sector. More attention needs to be paid to the key role of high levels of travel activity, and how these could be reduced.",1361-9209,Not found

Two reliability-based individual accessibility measures are proposed to evaluate individual accessibility by explicitly considering individual’s on-time arrival probability concern for activity participations. The proposed measures are further applied to quantify travel time uncertainty impacts on the equity of individual accessibility to shopping services. Results of this study demonstrate the capabilities of using spatiotemporal big data to examine the equity of accessibility in a disaggregated individual level. The results also suggest that travel time uncertainties have negative impacts on accessibility of all people groups, but more serious impacts on disadvantaged people groups with a lower accessibility level.",1361-9209,Not found
Development of a driving cycle for Istanbul bus rapid transit based on real-world data using stratified sampling method,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.023,75,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Environmental as well as financial issues forces to develop clean, efficient, and sustainable vehicles which constitutes an integral part of our daily life for urban transportation. Nevertheless, exhaust emissions of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles are the major source of global warming lead greenhouse effect. One solution for this issue is hybridization/electrification of the vehicles. One of the most important tools which can help to test performances of technical solutions systematically is driving cycles representing real driving conditions for vehicle emissions testing and estimation. When the history of the driving cycles was reviewed, it can be seen that there were big changes from constructing synthetically to real world cycles and from emission-focused cycles to emission, pollution and fuel consumption focused cycles. And now, a new application such as hybridization and/or electrification has been added to driving cycles. Main aim of this study is to create a practical driving cycle for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles. To do this, characteristic driving parameters such as speed, distance, time, acceleration have been determined first. Data acquisition from conventional vehicles running on İstanbul route was performed and then data were analysed. A driving cycle was developed by using Proportional Stratified Sampling (PSS) technique. Comparison between constructed driving cycle and the real-world data show that difference is less than 10%. And so, it can be concluded that proposed driving cycle was acceptable.",1361-9209,Not found
Influence of urban road characteristics on traffic noise,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.026,75,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Urban road networks significantly influence traffic noise. However, existing studies have neglected the causal chain between road characteristics and traffic noise; thus, clarity on their influencing mechanisms is lacking. In this study, structural equation models were developed to explore the mediated effect of road characteristics on traffic noise through traffic flow using data from field measurement in Dalian City, China; paired comparisons of scenarios though microscopic and macroscopic traffic simulations were performed for further analysis. The results show that lane number influences traffic noise mainly in terms of the number of vehicles in a group (NVG). More lanes indicate increased traffic demand due to connected urban land, which increases the NVG and, in turn, increases noise intensity but decreases noise amplitude. The influence of road segment length (RSL) on traffic noise mainly depends on the suppression effect. A longer RSL allows for higher vehicle speeds, leading to increased noise intensity and reduced noise amplitude. This also indicates that traffic flows disperse more easily, decreasing the NVG and, in turn, reducing noise intensity and increasing noise amplitude. Road junctions (RJ), which are classified according to the presence or absence of traffic lights, have significant direct effects on both noise intensity and noise amplitude, which are both likely to increase as drivers accelerate or decelerate in the middle of the road segment. These findings provide a reference for local governments and urban planners when working to improve quality of life in urban areas.",1361-9209,Not found

Accelerating the transition to alternative fuel vehicles through a Distributive Justice perspective,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.020,75,2019-10-01,2019,10,"In this paper, we investigate the ongoing endeavor to transition from conventional transportation to more sustainable systems. In addition to the traditional environmental objective, we propose a novel measure to quantify the social performance by using the concepts of Distributive Justice (DJ) and Sustainable Transition (ST) to investigate the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles (AFV). In our context, DJ is defined as fair access to transportation, the latter being a vital means for people to realize their full capabilities in the society. Furthermore, ST measures the social dimension through DJ and the environmental dimension through AFV sales. To model the complex network of relationships characterizing this framework, we use System Dynamics methodology to study the long term impact of considering DJ and ST. Our findings show that policy makers should adjust their targets to consider DJ criteria along with environmental objectives, thus aiming at a sustainable transition. By doing so, they can control and hasten the transition to AFV. Finally, we evaluate the contribution of each policy instrument to guide the policy-making process and catalyze this transition.",1361-9209,Not found
Utilization effects on battery electric vehicle life-cycle assessment: A case-driven analysis of two commercial mobility applications,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.005,75,2019-10-01,2019,10,"The utilization has a significant effect on the life-cycle assessment (LCA) of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). This article evaluates this effect in detail by presenting a case-driven LCA for BEVs deployed in two commercial mobility applications. The empirical data was recorded over 2.5 years and 450,000 km. The findings of this article indicate that regular and predictable mobility demand patterns in combination with a high vehicle utilization are favorable conditions for an environmentally beneficial deployment of BEVs. These characteristics allow tailoring the battery capacity to the requirements and avoiding an unnecessary offset from production. When charging the vehicles with electricity from renewable energy sources (RESs), the high operating grade utilizes the comparatively lower environmental impacts per kilometer. A high lifetime mileage allows breaking-even to comparable internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) in most investigated impact categories. Since regular and predictable mobility patterns, as well as a high operating grade, are commonly found in commercial applications these are especially suitable for replacing ICEVs with BEVs from an environmental perspective.",1361-9209,Not found

However, most studies measure accessibility from home only and report accessibility in terms of the travel time or number of activities. Such studies neglect the mobility and time budget constraints on people’s accessibility. Furthermore, modal accessibility disparity studies have not considered inequality between modes during the afternoon commute. We examine accessibility to non-work activities by automobile and public transport using spatiotemporal measures that determine the number of minutes people have available to participate in activities, given time budget and activity duration constraints, rather than simply the number of activities. We examine modal accessibility disparity in Warsaw, Poland. Our two major findings are the reverse of findings in previous studies: that disparity shifts toward public transport as the activity duration increases and the travel time decreases; and that it shifts toward public transport with increasing distance away from the city center.",1361-9209,Not found
Ridesplitting is shaping young people's travel behavior: Evidence from comparative survey via ride-sourcing platform,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.017,75,2019-10-01,2019,10,"To better understand the young people’s ridesplitting behavior characteristics and behavioral impacts on the emerging ride-sourcing platform, we present a survey-based comparison of DiDi Hitch and DiDi Express Pool that provide ridesplitting services in Hangzhou, China. Hitch is a social carpooling platform that helps commuters share rides. Express Pool is a mobility network providing pooled rides as the ridesplitting option of Express. In this paper, we explore why ridesplitting is popular, which mode is the primary, and how ridesplitting affects young people’s travel behavior. A total of 607 investigated responses were collected via the DiDi ride-sourcing platform. Based on the survey data, a variety of behavioral aspects were analyzed, including the trip purpose, temporal and spatial characteristics of trips, travel time/cost variation, and modal shift frequency. Behavioral impacts on modal shift were further analyzed in a binary logit framework. The findings show that Hitch and Express Pool have both similarities and differences. Hitch is intended for long trips, while Express Pool is mainly intended for short trips as a supplement of multimodal mobility. It also provides evidence for ridesplitting user identification and the market share loss of bus and taxi. Some suggestions are raised for discussions in future research.",1361-9209,Not found

Carbon offsetting and reduction scheme with sustainable aviation fuel options: Fleet-level carbon emissions impacts for U.S. airlines,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.015,75,2019-10-01,2019,10,"To reduce aviation carbon emissions, the International Civil Aviation Organization initiated the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which will take effect in 2021. In response, airlines have taken measures through various means, including the use of sustainable fuels. This article investigates the potential effects of a CORSIA-type policy when implemented in the United States. The study uses a combined model of airlines operations and multi-feedstock sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) to represent decisions of several actors, such as farmers, bio-refineries, airlines, and policymakers. The research employed a life-cycle assessment and Monte-Carlo simulation to evaluate two policy scenarios on the amount of SAF consumption and the resulting emissions. Implementing a CORSIA-type policy could stimulate the demand and production of SAFs, while also reducing air travel growth by increasing airfare. As a result of this combined effect and improved aircraft technology, there is a 3.5% chance that the U.S. airlines industry can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 37.5–50% by the year 2050, compared to the 2005 emission levels. Despite a projected increase in air travel in 2050 by a factor of 2.75 (the median value), the emissions in 2050 are expected to rise to only 120% (the median value) of the 2005 level. The price of petroleum-based aviation fuels followed by the growth rate of the carbon price are the two most important factors to determine whether the CORSIA-type policy would achieve the emission reduction target.",1361-9209,Not found
Design of material transportation systems for sustainability,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.014,75,2019-10-01,2019,10,"Moving towards sustainability implies a social challenge that entails urban planning and the environmental impact of the transport of waste management. Previous studies assume the use of a unique vehicle, but in this study; many levels of transportation are examined with different transportation methods at each level, allowing the use of greener and smaller transportation methods in urban centres. In this article, the comparison between the use of a unique vehicle and the use of a hierarchical structure for the collection and transportation is analyzed. In the first level of the transportation structure, the transportation method is, a human activity such as walking and carrying 10 kg, in the second level the transportation method was a bicycle carrying 100 kg and for the third and fourth levels the use of motorized vehicles carrying 1 and 10 tons of material. Results support the hierarchical structure with multiple levels and transportation methods to reduce energy consumption, over the most common use of a single level of transportation. The results show that population density has a significant association with reduced transport energy. Results also demonstrate that the loading ratio of each transportation method, the number of stops in each level and the energy spent per stop also affect the transport structure. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, this paper focuses on a real-life case study of the waste management system in Montreal, Canada.

Applying gradient boosting decision trees to the data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, this study addresses two gaps in the literature by identifying critical built environment determinants of CO2 emissions, and more importantly, illustrating threshold effects of built environment elements. The results show that three neighborhood-level built environment factors have the strongest influences on CO2 emissions: distance to the nearest transit stop, job density, and land use diversity. The distance to downtowns also has a substantial impact. This study further confirms that built environment variables are effective only within a certain range. These threshold effects offer valuable implications for planners to achieve desirable environmental benefits efficiently.",1361-9209,Not found

Heterogeneous residential preferences among millennials and members of generation X in California: A latent-class approach,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.001,76,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The millennial generation, the cohort born from 1981 to 1996, lives in large cities or denser parts of metropolitan areas more than preceding generations did at the same age. Studies have theorized that a combination of temporary economic hardship, long-term societal changes, and changing preferences and attitudes have been responsible for Millennials’ unique residential choices. This study examines a less-explored question about the presence and significance of heterogeneity in residential preferences across and within generations. In doing so, this study employs a latent-class choice model on a commuter subsample of Millennials and members of Generation X (n = 729) of the California Millennials Dataset, which collected a rich set of variables on various dimensions in Fall 2015.

The aim of the framework is to minimize cumulative noise annoyance and fuel burn. In the first step of the framework, multi-objective trajectory optimization is used to compute and store a set of routes that will serve as inputs in the second step. In the second step, the selection of routes from the sets of pre-computed optimal routes and the optimal allocation of flights to these routes are conducted simultaneously. To validate the proposed framework, we also conduct an analysis involving an integrated (one-step) approach, in which both trajectory optimization and route allocation are formulated as a single optimization problem. A comparison of both approaches is then performed, and their advantages and disadvantages are identified. The performance and capabilities of the present framework are demonstrated using a case study at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in The Netherlands. The numerical results show that the proposed framework can generate solutions which can achieve a reduction in the number of people annoyed of up to 31% and a reduction in fuel consumption of 7.3% relative to the reference case solution.",1361-9209,Not found
Demand drivers for charging infrastructure-charging behavior of plug-in electric vehicle commuters,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.015,76,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The public as well as the private sector that includes automakers and charging network companies are increasingly investing in building charging infrastructure to encourage the adoption and use of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) as well as to ensure that current facilities are not congested. However, building infrastructure is costly and, like road congestion, when there is significant uptake of PEVs we may not be able to “build out of congestion.” Modelling the choice of charging infrastructure of more than 3000 PEV drivers who had the opportunity to select among home, work, and public locations, we focus on understanding the importance of factors driving demand such as: the cost of charging, driver characteristics, access to charging infrastructure, and vehicle characteristics. We find that differences in the cost of charging play an important role in the demand for charging location. PEV drivers tend to substitute toward workplace charging when they pay a higher electricity rate at home, more so when the former is free. Additionally, socio-demographic factors like dwelling type and gender, as well as vehicle technology like electric range, influence the choice of charging location.",1361-9209,Not found
Designing area pricing schemes to minimize travel disutility and exposure to pollutants,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.001,76,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The introduction of area-based pricing schemes is often motivated by both urban congestion and pollution concerns. Existing discrete network optimization models for the design of area pricing schemes focus primarily on travel-related objectives, such as maximizing social welfare measures based on travel costs. In this paper, an area pricing problem is proposed that explicitly accounts for both travel- and environmentally-oriented objectives to optimally define charging boundaries and tolling levels. The environmental objective is formulated from an equity perspective. Specifically, it is assumed that regional planners are interested in minimizing inequality in the levels of pollutant encountered by individuals as they perform their daily activities. Here, pollutant exposure is specified in terms of agent-level intake of pollutants. In addition, it is assumed that pricing schemes must reduce pollutant concentrations in the region below an established threshold. A network-based activity model is presented as an approach for modeling the changes in travelers’ mobility behavior and activity patterns in response to pricing schemes. A surrogate-based optimization approach is proposed to solve the area pricing problem, as it is likely that, in practice, this design problem would be computationally costly. The proposed algorithm uses a geometric representation of the charging boundary. New procedures for generating candidate boundary locations are presented, which include the use of surrogate-based methods to screen for feasible, non-dominated solutions prior to their evaluation via the computationally expensive models. The proposed model and solution heuristic are tested using the Chicago Sketch Network and a smaller test network.",1361-9209,Not found
Spatial-temporal heterogeneity of air pollution: The relationship between built environment and on-road PM2.5 at micro scale,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.004,76,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Research on the relationship between built environment and PM2.5 has attracted notable attention during the past decades. However, previous studies were less to test the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of on-road PM2.5 and its related factors at micro scale. To this end, collecting high-resolution PM2.5 data by mobile monitoring along different roads in Guangzhou, China, this paper explored the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the relationship between built environment and on-road PM2.5 during the morning (7–9 am) and evening (7–9 pm) rush hours. Semi-variogram method and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model were utilized to reveal the non-stationarity associations among the large spatial dataset. In terms of temporal heterogeneity, the results showed that the spatial independent radii of on-road PM2.5 were 17 m and 21 m for morning and evening rush hours respectively. The aggregated median value of PM2.5 in the morning rush hours was 34.95 μg/m3, while the evening was up to 55.49 μg/m3. There were more significant factors of street conditions impact on on-road PM2.5 in the morning while more significant factors of land use and centrality that reflecting the cumulative effect of daily human activities with smaller buffer thresholds in the evening. In terms of spatial heterogeneity, GWR models achieved much better performance than the global ones of multivariate regression models with lower AICc, RMSE and higher adjusted R2 , explaining 10–69% of variance across different roads and rush hours. There was a high degree of spatial heterogeneity that the leading factors were different along various roads on rush hours. The results indicated that the policies and interventions should be more targeted to improve the on-road air environment and reduce personal exposure according to the spatial-temporal geographical context. It can be adopted to provide more realistic and practical guides for urban planning and environmental pollution control.",1361-9209,Not found

Realizing how crucial their potential is, we provide a thorough assessment of bicycle acceptance in general and DASB in particular. For an analysis to include perceptions related to the built environment, it would require an investigation ground that complies with three major conditions: (i) displays a common urban environment typology; (ii) features a high bicycle modal share; and (iii) presents a high penetration level of DASB. The most restrictive requirement being the common typology, we focused on university campuses to ensure consistency over each area investigated. After selecting five campuses across Shanghai, a pioneer city for DASB featuring one of the highest bicycle modal share worldwide, we surveyed 1131 respondents about their perception and use of the bicycle. A detailed analysis of our statistical model reveals that cycling is appreciated and even encouraged by a substantial, yet reasonable bicycle density. Moreover, DASB systems appear to paradoxically improve the cycling experience while generating new nuisances such as an increase in perceived danger and major parking issues. We believe our results could have a profound impact on how cycling infrastructures are thought about and realised. Indeed, understanding how DASBs affect the built environment could help city planners to overcome the major setbacks arising from DABS’s fast paced expansion while still encouraging the regular practice of cycling.",1361-9209,Not found

The fleet composition and driving conditions are characterized by the number of vehicles, their speeds and their types (passenger cars [PCs], light commercial vehicles [LCVs], heavy-duty vehicles [HDVs]) as well as their characteristics (make, model, fuel, engine, EURO emission standard, etc.). The number of vehicles passing on the boulevard is around 20,000 per day with about 44% of Euro 5 and Euro 6 vehicles. The impacts of fleet composition on emission were analyzed by ANOVA. The results show that the fleet composition has a significant impact on emissions for different pollutants. Higher percentage of gasoline PCs between Euro 4 to Euro 6 and Euro 4 diesel PCs induces more BC emission. Higher percentage of old gasoline and diesel vehicles (≤ Euro 3) induces higher emission of toluene, ethylbenzene and m + p- and o-xylene. Furthermore, emission factors estimated in this work were compared to those calculated in other in-situ studies that show a good agreement. For the chassis bench comparison, the in-situ PN and BC emission factors are in the same range as those measured for diesel vehicles without particle filter and gasoline vehicles with direct injection system.

This study explores the effects of AVs and vehicle electrification on greenhouse gas emissions using traffic microsimulation and emission modeling. The driving behavior modeling parameters most relevant to AVs are tested within ranges representing potential AV operations. The effects of AVs are evaluated under both uninterrupted and interrupted traffic flow conditions, representing highway driving and driving on arterial roads, under high and low traffic demand. The main findings indicate that AVs can bring positive changes in terms of emissions and traffic flow performance. The effects are more evident when AVs are tuned to more aggressive driving settings (i.e., drive closer together) and especially under high levels of traffic demand in an uninterrupted flow setting (highway). When AVs are programmed to operate more aggressively, the subsequent emission factors could be reduced by up to 26% on the expressway, while cautiously programmed AVs could deteriorate traffic performance and lead to a 35% increase in emissions.",1361-9209,Not found

We found that public transportation reduced travel time to urban parks for all residents, while it significantly increased the spatial inequality of urban park accessibility between public and private housing residents. We concluded that the spatial inequality of public park accessibility between public and private housing residents in Hong Kong did not owe to the spatial distribution of the urban parks or of the residential locations.

Factors underlying vehicle ownership reduction among carsharing users: A repeated cross-sectional analysis,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.018,76,2019-11-01,2019,11,"This study identifies and compares factors that drive carsharing users’ vehicle ownership changes, using repeated cross-sectional surveys conducted in the early (2014) and mature (2018) phases of the carsharing program in Seoul, Korea. Launched in 2013, the carsharing program has experienced a rapid growth in rental facilities and membership. Two types of mixed-effect logistic regression models are developed to predict the reduction in car ownership and the decision to defer a car purchase among carsharing members, respectively, for each phase, and the changes in estimated coefficients between two phases are evaluated statistically. Results show that about 31% of the members reduced their current or potential car ownership in favor of shared automobility in both phases, while the proportion of those who shed a private vehicle almost doubled from 2.3% to 4.3%. Carsharing’s impact on vehicle ownership reduction appears to be extended to more general cohorts of the membership (e.g., higher income, larger households) as the program expands and ages. While accessibility to carsharing services is consistently important for deciding against vehicle ownership, the relative importance of satisfaction with customer services, accident claims process, and rental charges increased significantly between 2014 and 2018. Those who choose shared vehicles for business or commute trips are more willing to decrease their vehicle ownership than those using the service for non-work trips. These findings help develop a clear understanding of carsharing users’ behavioral changes in terms of car ownership following the growth of carsharing services, with insights on the direction of further service improvement.",1361-9209,Not found
Optimal charging management and infrastructure planning for free-floating shared electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.021,76,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Recently, major car-sharing service providers have begun to include electric vehicles (EVs) in free-floating car-sharing fleets. For these EVs, downtime due to charging, including time spent traveling to and waiting in queues at charging stations in a sparse charging infrastructure network, is a major barrier to sustainable operation. An intuitive solution to overcome this barrier is to increase the number of fast-charging stations in the fleet service area. This paper studies the relationship between fleet vehicle downtime and the number of charging stations by modeling the fleet operations of a major car-sharing service provider. An integer programming model is developed that jointly optimizes charging station allocation, in terms of the number and location of charging stations, and the assignment of EVs to charging stations. Case study results showed that fleet vehicle charging time comprises 72–75% of the total downtime spent on charging trips. This indicates that charging time, as opposed to travel time or waiting time, is the dominant component of total fleet downtime for charging. The study also shows that by adding 5–20 new charging stations reduces total fleet downtime and travel time during charging trips by 2–4% and 26–49%, respectively. Although adding new charging stations to the fleet service area reduces total charging trip travel time significantly, it does not reduce total downtime significantly. Results also show that if the EV battery state of the charge (SOC) threshold—below which a charging trip is initiated—is less than 18%, not all EVs in the car-sharing fleet can be charged using the existing direct current fast chargers (DCFCs) in the fleet’s service area. This implies that adequate charging infrastructure coverage is required to ensure that EVs of a given range can operate in the car-sharing fleet.",1361-9209,Not found

This study examines the walking accessibility to recreational amenities for older adults in the Chinese context with an explicit focus on equity.

To this end, we draw on the 2015 Nanjing Travel Survey and the city’s GIS database. Instead of assuming a fixed threshold, this paper applies a spatial expansion model to allow for person- and location-specific walking distances to measure accessibility. The spatial disparities in access to recreational amenities are evaluated using the notion of vertical equity for identifying areas that are better-off or worse-off. Our results show pronounced distributional effects of current land-use and transportation policies for different age cohorts. In particular, elderly people experience lower accessibility to chess/card rooms and urban parks than their younger counterparts. The empirical evidence in this research can inform planning and policy interventions and feed current scientific debates on the role of accessibility in addressing social inclusion for an age-friendly society.",1361-9209,Not found
Impacts of free-floating bikesharing system on public transit ridership,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.014,76,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The development of bike sharing system (BSS) has changed travelers’ commuting and lifestyle in recent years. Whether BSSs are complementary or competitive to public transit remains controversial. This study uses a propensity score matching-based difference-in-difference (DID) method to evaluate the impact of free-floating BSS on bus ridership in Chengdu, China. The transaction data of bus service and BSS and the neighboring points of interest are investigated. Results indicate that, (a) on the bus route level, each shared bike results in a 4.23 increment and a 0.56 reduction in daily bus ridership on weekdays and weekends, respectively; (b) on the bus stop level, the increment in shared bikes significantly negatively impacts bus ridership on weekends; (c) on the route level, regarding the time of day, each unit increment of shared bike significantly increases bus ridership on weekdays by 0.54, 0.34, and 0.15 during a.m. peak, p.m. peak, and off peak, respectively; and (d) on the bus stop level, the relationship between shared bikes and bus ridership is insignificant on weekdays.

Racial/ethnic differences in job accessibility effects: Explaining employment and commutes in the Los Angeles region,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.007,76,2019-11-01,2019,11,"The lack of spatial access to job opportunities is considered one major barrier that explains low employment rates and long commutes of racial/ethnic minorities, particularly in the U.S. But it is unclear whether the job accessibility effects vary by race/ethnicity. This research fills this gap. Results based on the Los Angeles region reveal complicated relationships: job accessibility has similarly insignificant effects on the employment probability of white and black job seekers, while the effects on Hispanics and Asians are plausible and significant in low- and medium-education groups. High job accessibility by transit mode reduces commute distance for all racial/ethnic groups, but job accessibility by automobile does not. Therefore, policies that aim to improve economic prospects or to reduce commutes and related externalities need to be both place-sensitive, e.g., improving transit services to employment clusters, and race/ethnicity-sensitive, e.g., considering transportation needs of low- and medium-education Hispanic and Asian workers.",1361-9209,Not found
"Comparing alternative heavy-duty drivetrains based on GHG emissions, ownership and abatement costs: Simulations of freight routes in British Columbia",10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.031,76,2019-11-01,2019,11,"This study quantified the well-to-wheel GHG emissions, total ownership costs and abatement cost for 16 different heavy-duty truck (HDT) drivetrains, including those powered by natural gas, electricity, and hydrogen. Using the case of British Columbia, Canada, we employed GPS activity data for almost 1600 container tractor-trailer trucks to extract six distinct drive cycles. Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the range of uncertainties in several critical model parameters. Results vary widely across drivetrains and across drive cycles. Using hydroelectricity, the battery electric catenary and pure battery electric drivetrains emit the lowest GHG per tonne km on short and long haul cycles respectively. On average over the variety of drive cycles, the plug-in parallel-hybrid diesel has the lowest total ownership cost (including infrastructure costs) for both short and long haul operations. We divided ownership costs by GHG reductions to calculate abatement costs ($/tonne). Plug-in parallel hybrid diesels have the lowest abatement cost, with negative costs on most drive cycles either using diesel or bio-diesel. Comparing drivetrains with their maximum cargo loads, plug-in parallel hybrid fuel cell and conventional diesel have the highest capacity on short and long haul routes respectively. Our analyses can help policymakers, industry and other stakeholders to compare different pathways to reduce GHG emissions in freight, including tradeoffs between the magnitude and cost of emissions reduction. Our conclusion highlights the implications and challenges of drivetrain choice, as well as recommending some areas for further improving the analysis.",1361-9209,Not found
Real-world emissions of gaseous pollutants from motorcycles on Indian urban arterials,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.010,76,2019-11-01,2019,11,"Motor vehicles contribute significantly to the total emissions in a city. Several studies have attempted to quantify emissions from cars, buses, and trucks using laboratory-based or real-world emission tests. However, real-world emissions from motorcycles (or motorized two-wheelers) has not received adequate attention. Unlike developed countries where cars are predominantly used for personal transport, motorcycles are widely used in developing countries. In this study, we quantify emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitric oxide (NO) from four typical motorcycles (MC 1, MC 2, MC 3, and MC 4) using real-world emission measurements and develop emission models. We also compare the observed real-world speed-time profiles with the laboratory test cycles and the emission factors developed using real-world emission measurements with the Bharat Stage (BS) emission standards. The real-world emission factors of CO for MC 1, MC 2, MC 3, and MC 4 were 12.3 times, 3.18 times, 9.71 times, and 5.84 times above the respective BS emission standard values. Also, the CO and [HC + NO] emissions from a two-stroke motorcycle (MC 1) were higher than the four-stroke motorcycles. The models presented in this paper can be used to accurately quantify real-world emissions from motorcycles on Indian urban arterials and to formulate policies for air quality improvement.",1361-9209,Not found
Psychological and behavioral factors affecting electric vehicle adoption and satisfaction: A comparative study of early adopters in China and Korea,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.009,76,2019-11-01,2019,11,"This study compares psychological and behavioral factors affecting EV (electric vehicle) adoption and satisfaction between China, the largest EV market in the world, and Korea, a fledgling EV market. Respective samples were collected from relatively mature EV users in four major cities in China (Chinese early majority) and from members of a fledgling EV community in Korea (Korean early adopters). The results show that environmental concern is an important determinant of EV purchase for the Chinese early majority, whereas the goal of minimizing operating costs is the most important determinant for the Korean early adopters. Usage satisfaction is high in both samples, with this factor being higher for the Korean early adopters than for the Chinese early majority. Usage satisfaction is also found to be related to the original purchase motive. Finally, EV owners in both countries cited “battery range” and “battery charging” as the two most important reasons for their dissatisfaction.

Perception towards electric vehicles and the impact on consumers’ preference,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.003,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Relative advantage, or the degree to which a new technology is perceived to be better than an existing technology which is being replaced, has a significant impact on individuals’ decisions on when, how and to what extent to adopt. An integrated choice and latent variable model is used, in this paper, to explicitly measure the perceived advantages in electric vehicles over the conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. The analysed data is obtained from a stated preference survey including 1076 residents in New South Wales, Australia. According to the results, the latent component of the model disentangles the perceived advantages across three dimensions of vehicle design, impact on the environment, and safety. These latent variables are interacted with price, driving range and body type, respectively, to capture the impact of perception on preference. The developed model is then used to examine the effectiveness of different support schemes on Millennials (Gen Y), the generation before them (Gen X) and after them (Gen Z). The results show higher probability of adopting electric vehicles for Gen Y, compared to Gen X and Z. Gen Y is found to be the least sensitive cohort to purchase price, and Gen X to be the most sensitive cohort to this attribute. People are more sensitive to incentives for the initial price compared to ongoing incentives for operating costs. Also, offering financial incentives to consumers as a rebate on the purchase price is more effective than allocating the same incentive to manufacturers to reduce the purchase price.",1361-9209,Not found

Environmental and economic impacts of expanding electric vehicle public charging infrastructure in California′s counties,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.017,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Plug-in electric Vehicles (PEVs) are believed to be one of the solutions to mitigate emissions from road transportation. Which types of factors are most effective at encouraging PEV adoption, and what magnitude of reduction in emissions could be achieved by expanding charging infrastructure as an influential factor on PEVs? To answer these questions, we developed a statistical model relating charging station infrastructure and other potential factors to PEV adoption rate in 58 California counties. We found that male buyers in households with fewer number of vehicles are more likely to purchase PEVs particularly in counties with more available public charging station per capita. Then we investigated the life-cycle petroleum use, emissions, and costs of light duty vehicles for a hypothetical scenario where existing public charging stations are expanded relative to total daily miles travelled in each county. We found under this scenario Modoc County experiences the largest reduction in life-cycle GHG emissions, by 0.035%, followed by Sierra and Mono counties. The smallest potential is found in counties with low response rate to expanded charging station infrastructure, led by Alpine, Del Norte, and King counties. For 20 counties, including Butte, San Joaquin, and San Francisco, the benefit-cost ratio is less than one, which means the investment and maintenance costs of new infrastructure have not been offset by operation and externality cost savings. For the rest of the counties, this scenario is found to be compatible. The results assist planners in assessing environmental and economic benefits of PEVs and optimizing infrastructural investments.",1361-9209,Not found
A methodology for high resolution vehicular emissions inventories in metropolitan areas: Evaluating the effect of automotive technologies improvement,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.007,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"The establishment of public policies that successfully control pollutants concentration in the atmosphere has been a challenge in many urban areas. As the road transport is an important source of pollution, information on fleet composition and its emissions are important to verify emissions control strategies and to guide mitigation measures. In that context, the present study proposes a method to develop and evaluate high resolution inventories for road transport emissions in metropolitan areas. This method was applied to the Florianópolis Metropolitan Area (FLMA), in Santa Catarina, Brazil. A probabilistic bottom-up approach was employed using modeled transportation data to produce a vehicular emissions inventory in high resolution. This approach was developed to account for fleet characteristics in emission factors estimations. The impact of vehicle categories and their emissions distribution was also analyzed. Results showed that light vehicles categories were responsible for 96% of CO, 87% of NMHC, 82% of CH4 and 74% of N2O emissions, well distributed throughout the road network. Heavy-duty vehicles emitted the biggest amount of the NOx and MP (80% and 94%, respectively), mostly concentrated in expressways. An analysis of emissions on each network hierarchy showed that expressways comprehended 45% of CO, 48% of HC, 79% of NOx, and 85% of PM emissions. The residual part of those pollutants is emitted by local, collector, connector and arterial roads. And finally, a hypothetical scenario pointed that replacing the FLMA’s fleet for vehicles of model-year from 2017 has a potential to decrease emissions up to 95%.",1361-9209,Not found
Can Canadian households benefit economically from purchasing battery electric vehicles?,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.014,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This study uses a 2015 national survey data set to investigate the economic suitability of Canadian households for a battery electric vehicle (BEV) purchase. We compare the total cost of ownership (TCO) for a BEV and an equivalent internal combustion engine vehicle (ICE) of similar vehicle class under a series of incentive and purchase price scenarios. Even with no incentive in place, we find that a considerable share of households (18%) in our national sample are economically suited for a BEV purchase. A bivariate ordered probit model is then used to estimate annual mileage and vehicle ownership period. These variables are the most influential factors on the TCO outcome. According to the results, suburban, multi-vehicle households with children have higher mileages. Education and income have positive impacts on both annual mileage and ownership period, and thus on increasing the economic suitability of BEVs. Results of this study suggest targeted decisions regarding policy and marketing based on consumer conditions as ways to further promote the adoption of BEVs in Canada.",1361-9209,Not found
Are internally observable vehicle data good predictors of vehicle emissions?,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.004,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Scientific research has demonstrated that on-road exhaust emissions in diesel passenger vehicles (DPV) exceeds the official laboratory-test values. Increasing concern about the quantification of magnitude for these differences has meant an increasing use of Portable Emissions Monitoring System (PEMS), but the direct use of Internally Observable Variables (IOVs) can be useful to predict emissions. The motivation for this paper is to develop an empirical approach that integrates second-by-second vehicle activity and emission rates for DPV. The objectives of this research are two-fold: (1) to assess the effect of variation in acceleration-based parameters, vehicle specific power (VSP) and IOVs on carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission rates; and (2) to examine the correlation between IOV-based predictors of engine load and VSP. Field measurements were collected from four DPV (two small, one medium and one multi-purpose) in urban, rural and highway routes using PEMS, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and On-board Diagnostic (OBD) scan tool, to measure real-world exhaust emissions and engine activity data. Results suggest the relative positive acceleration (RPA) and mean positive acceleration (MPA) allowed a good differentiation with respect to route trips. IOVs models based on the product of manifold absolute pressure (MAP) and engine revolutions per minute (RPM), and VSP showed to be good predictors of emission rates. Although the CO2 correlation was found to be good (R 2 > 0.8), the models for NOx showed mixed results since some vehicles showed a reasonable correlation (R 2 ~ 0.7) while others resulted in worst model predictions (R 2 < 0.6). IOVs models have potential to be integrated into vehicle engine units and connected vehicles, for instance, to provide real-time information on emissions rates, but other parameters regarding the thermal management on after treatment system must be included in NOx prediction. This would allow for a better understanding of true physics behind NOx emissions in DPV.",1361-9209,Not found
Longitudinal changes in transport-related and recreational walking: The role of life events,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.006,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Walking is a common form of physical activity and has a considerable impact on public health. Walking behavior may change over time due to life events, including residential relocation. Only a few studies based on longitudinal data have examined the impacts of life events on walking behavior.

In total, 1185 respondents aged 18 or older who completed both survey waves were included in our sample. Multilevel mixed-effects Tobit regression models were fitted and showed that both childbirth and relocation to less urbanized areas were related to an increase in transport-related walking over time. No significant associations of life events with recreational walking were observed. Findings suggest that transport-related walking is more likely to be influenced by changes in the household composition and residential relocation than recreational walking.

Estimation of environmental impacts of roads through life cycle assessment: A critical review and future directions,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.010,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Motivated by the lack of a systematic analysis of the use of life cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate the environmental impacts of roads, this study conducts a critical review to examine the methods, common practices, limitations, and underlying reasons, so that future directions can be recommended. In this work, 94 papers that adopt LCA methods to assess the environmental impacts over the whole life cycle of roads were analyzed. The results demonstrate that the process-based LCA remains the most commonly adopted LCA method; however, the hybrid LCA has been gradually recognized. After examining the goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory, life cycle impact assessment, and life cycle interpretation of these studies, it was found that the current LCA applications in roads face limitations owing to the inconsistent and inappropriate selection of the functional unit, limited consideration of the maintenance and repair, use, and end-of-life phases, limited reporting of data sources, lack of standardized impact assessment procedures, and lack of sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. These limitations can be attributed to the lack of a standardized LCA procedure for roads. There is also a lack of LCA studies focusing on network-level analysis, which may restrict the use of LCA to assist policy making in road planning and management. In addition, the time effect is rarely considered to reflect the dynamic changes of environmental impacts over the project life cycle. Therefore, future directions are recommended accordingly. Improvements in these areas are expected to generate more reliable LCA results for informed decision making.",1361-9209,Not found
Exploring the effect of battery capacity on electric vehicle sharing programs using a simulation approach,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.013,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Aided by mobile computing technology, shared electric vehicles (SEVs) have become an accessible and affordable mobility option. However, limited battery capacity remains a major obstacle for large-scale adoption of SEVs, and greatly undermines their popularity. In this study, a discrete-event simulation approach was employed to estimate how battery capacity affects the performance of a carsharing program. Results show that limited battery capacity lowered user satisfaction and vehicle utilization in the program. Increased charging speed, maximum range, and vehicle-to-trip ratio help mitigate these negative effects. Specifically, increasing the maximum range or charging speed contributes to the increment of the average SEV usage time and the percentage of satisfied rental requests. A higher vehicle-to-trip ratio contributes to a greater level of user satisfaction but a lower level of vehicle utilization. Additionally, the negative effects of battery capacity are greatly diminished after charging speed is increased to a certain threshold. These findings help capture the trade-off between charging facility investment, vehicle utilization, and user satisfaction. Increasing charging speed and maximum range are necessary if operators want to maximize vehicle utilization and promote user satisfaction. However, this investment must also account for cost-effectiveness.",1361-9209,Not found

However, countries differ regarding their framework conditions, e.g. the availability of home charging, and the question of how much public charging infrastructure is needed cannot be answered equally for all countries. Yet, studies analyzing the framework conditions for the medium- to long-term demand for charging infrastructure are rare. Here, we review the existing literature and summarize the evidence for the importance of framework conditions on charging infrastructure needs. Furthermore, we illustrate the literature evidence by comparing the framework conditions for charging infrastructure in different countries based on a comprehensive dataset of framework parameters.

In this method, environmental impacts (e.g., particulate matter and carbon dioxide emissions) and safety concerns (e.g., deaths and injuries in accidents) are treated as undesirable outputs under the slacks-based measure (SBM). We apply the model to conduct a joint assessment of environmental impacts and safety concerns of road transport for a group of OECD countries over the period 2000–2014. We show that the unified measure from joint assessment can be drastically different from that of assessing environment and safety separately.

Existing models for public transport network design cannot adequately capture the dependence between electric vehicle charging infrastructure requirements and route operational characteristics. In this context, this paper investigates the combined Transit Route Network Design and Charging Infrastructure Location Problem and proposes a bi-level formulation to handle both planning stages. At the upper level, candidate route sets are generated and evaluated, while at the lower-level wireless charging infrastructures are optimally deployed. A multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MO-PSO) algorithm embedded with an integer programming solver is employed to handle the complexity of the problem and the conflicting design objectives related to passengers and operators.

Energy and emissions implications of automated vehicles in the U.S. energy system,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.003,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Vehicle automation has the potential to drastically transform transportation, with important implications for energy and the environment. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of automation on travel demand and vehicle efficiency. We utilize the MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) energy system model to examine four previously published scenarios that consider different effects of automation on efficiency and demand. We do not replicate detailed estimation of individual mechanisms but apply key outcomes from prior studies within a broader energy system framework. Our analysis adds insights on fuel switching, upstream impacts, and air emissions. MARKAL dynamically captures interactions between transportation and non-transportation sectors, which is important given that the revolutionary shifts from automation may invalidate static assumptions. Model results suggest that increasing travel demands from automation may boost fuel use and petroleum-based fuel prices, potentially increasing the market penetration of alternative-fuel vehicles. In contrast, dramatic efficiency improvements from automation could drive fuel prices lower, greatly reducing the competitiveness of alternative-fueled vehicles. Furthermore, these shifts could yield positive or negative environmental impacts. Some automation scenarios even resulted in counterintuitive results. For example, if high levels of efficiency improvement drive out alternative-fuel vehicles, such as battery electric and hybrids, a net worsening of air quality relative to the other scenarios could result. We also found system-level dynamics to be key. For example, reductions in liquid fuel prices led to increased consumption, and the resulting increase in air pollutant emissions offset a portion of the potential air quality benefits of automation.",1361-9209,Not found

Six multisource regression models were estimated to explain the variation of taxi ridership in the last 24 h. Characteristics of the approaching hurricane, local weather conditions, and zonal socio-demographic variables were entered as explanatory variables. It was found that taxi ridership during hurricane-affected periods has a strong linear association with the ridership in unaffected periods but the proportion decreases as the storm approaches; a storm has the greatest impact on taxi ridership during weekend and at night, and the least impact on a weekday during the day; and taxi users make fewer trips during conditions of heavy rain or strong wind.",1361-9209,Not found

A vehicle specific power (VSP) based approach is applied to estimate fuel consumption. A typical signalized intersection in Beijing is selected to verify the optimization model.

Analysis of transit users’ waiting tolerance in response to unplanned service disruptions,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.011,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Public transit not only provides an affordable, efficient, and green service but also plays a critical role in the development of resilient transportation systems in urban areas. Transit disruption as a common incident in transit service operation can severely affect the resiliency of the transportation system as well as users’ satisfaction. While it is of great interest to transportation authorities to understand passengers’ decision behavior during unplanned transit disruptions in order to implement efficacious recovery strategies, still little is known about users’ behavior in case of such incidents. The scarcity of available data is a major underlying factor for this gap. Utilizing a recently collected data of transit users in the Chicago metropolitan area, the current study investigates transit users’ waiting tolerance during unplanned service disruptions and disclose the factors that affect their behavior. A set of interval-censored accelerated failure time models using different survival distributions are developed, compared, and the factors influencing the survival functions of the waiting tolerance are identified. The results of the analysis reveal that, for instance, having experience of using ridesharing services decreases users’ waiting tolerance during a disruption. Further, built-environment attributes (such as the density of pedestrian-oriented links and transit service frequency), availability of alternative modes, transit service type, user’s attitudes, and trip characteristics turn to be significant in users’ decision behavior.",1361-9209,Not found

This study contributes by providing new evidence about spatial heterogeneity in consumer preferences for AFVs in space using the most recent travel behavior data. The Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is used to explore the spatially varying correlates of AFV ownership. Results reveal significant spatial variations in the associations of AFV ownership and key factors across the United States. For example, high-income households in Southeastern or Northwestern states are more likely to own an AFV. Seniors are with a greater likelihood of owning an AFV relative to young adults, especially in Northeastern and Northwestern states. The effectiveness of incentives is uneven across different states. The incentives are more effective in Florida than in other parts of the country. The number of alternative fuel stations is positively related to AFV ownership. Other spatially varying correlates are related to household size, education, daily trip distance, and online shopping behavior.

The intended outcome of the study is to provide information about consumer preferences regarding owning AFVs, which can potentially impact our transition to a low Carbon economy.",1361-9209,Not found
Impact of restrictions to tackle high pollution episodes in Madrid: Modal share change in commuting corridors,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.021,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"With the increasing concern about environmental problems in metropolitan areas, policy-makers are establishing restrictions on private vehicles in city centers to mitigate air pollution levels. Like many other European cities, Madrid fails to fulfill repeatedly the legal limits on pollutant concentrations established by the European Commission. Accordingly, in order to comply with acceptable air quality levels, Madrid City Council passed a protocol to address high NO2 pollution episodes. This paper aims at gaining deeper insight into how emission abatement plans foster a more sustainable mobility in suburban trips. To that end, a discrete choice analysis is conducted to explore the influence of the different restriction stages on modal share in a commuting corridor. Based on traffic counts and transit entrances, two multinomial grouped logit models are calibrated. Moreover, differences across trip frequencies are studied in order to determine to what extent a modal shift from private vehicles to more environmentally-friendly modes of transport occurs. The paper concludes that modal choice in suburban trips is influenced by the mobility restrictions adopted. Nevertheless, this effect shows to be fairly limited in the case of the Madrid NO2 Protocol. Therefore, more severe measures should be implemented to achieve a greater modal shift towards more sustainable transport modes.",1361-9209,Not found
Economic analysis of a high-pressure urban pipeline concept (HyLine) for delivering hydrogen to retail fueling stations,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.005,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Reducing the cost of delivering hydrogen to fueling stations and dispensing it into fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) is one critical element of efforts to increase the cost-competitiveness of FCEVs. Today, hydrogen is primarily delivered to stations by trucks. Pipeline delivery is much rarer: one urban U.S. station has been supplied with 800-psi hydrogen from an industrial hydrogen pipeline since 2011, and a German station on the edge of an industrial park has been supplied with 13,000-psi hydrogen from a pipeline since 2006. This article compares the economics of existing U.S. hydrogen delivery methods with the economics of a high-pressure, scalable, intra-city pipeline system referred to here as the “HyLine” system. In the HyLine system, hydrogen would be produced at urban industrial or commercial sites, compressed to 15,000 psi, stored at centralized facilities, delivered via high-pressure pipeline to retail stations, and dispensed directly into FCEVs. Our analysis of retail fueling station economics in Los Angeles suggests that, as FCEV demand for hydrogen in an area becomes sufficiently dense, pipeline hydrogen delivery gains an economic advantage over truck delivery. The HyLine approach would also enable cheaper dispensed hydrogen compared with lower-pressure pipeline delivery owing to economies of scale associated with integrated compression and storage. In the largest-scale fueling scenario analyzed (a network of 24 stations with capacities of 1500 kg/d each, and hydrogen produced via steam methane reforming), HyLine could potentially achieve a profited hydrogen cost of $5.3/kg, which is approximately equivalent to a gasoline cost of $2.7/gal (assuming FCEVs offer twice the fuel economy of internal combustion engine vehicles and vehicle cost is competitive). It is important to note that significant effort would be required to develop technical knowledge, codes, and standards that would enable a HyLine system to be viable. However, our preliminary analysis suggests that the HyLine approach merits further consideration based on its potential economic advantages. These advantages could also include the value of minimizing retail space used by hydrogen compression and storage sited at fueling stations, which is not reflected in our analysis.",1361-9209,Not found
Investigating observed and unobserved variation in the probability of ‘not travel’ as a behavioural response to restrictive policies,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.008,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Besides technological improvements, restrictive car policies are likely to be the most effective measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from local passenger transport. Restrictive policies may lead some individuals to choose to not travel to otherwise useful or enjoyable activities. This paper therefore explores what factors drive the probability of ‘not travel’ as a behavioural response to restrictive policies. Using stated choice data among car owners in the 10 largest cities in Norway, we investigate observed and unobserved taste variation for ‘not travel’ given different (hypothetical) policies. The empirical evidence suggests that the likelihood of ‘not travel’ (a) is lower for work-related trips; (b) is higher where respondents state they have no decent alternatives; (c) increases with trip distance; and (d) increases with the intensity of the policy. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations illustrating different predicted choice behaviour for car users and public transport users under different types of stylized policies (travel time changes versus travel cost changes).",1361-9209,Not found
Designing wildlife crossing structures for ungulates in a desert landscape: A case study in China,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.015,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This paper reports on the design of wildlife crossing structures (WCSs) along a new expressway in China, which exemplifies the country’s increasing efforts on wildlife protection in infrastructure projects. The line and belt transect method, the surface water survey, and the sign-tracking investigation were used to determine the target species in the study area and the quantity, candidate locations, size, and type of the WCSs. The intensity index and encounter rate showed that the ibex (Capra ibex), argali sheep (Ovis ammon), and goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) are the main ungulates in the study area. Among them, the goitered gazelle is the most widely distributed species. Underpass WCSs were proposed based on the expert knowledge and crossing hotspots estimated using survey results. The mean distance between estimated hotspots and their nearest proposed WCSs is around 341 m. In addition, those proposed WCSs have a width of no less than 12 m and height of no lower than 3.5 m, which is believed to be sufficient for ungulates in the area. Given the limited availability of high-resolution movement data and wildlife-vehicle collision data during the road’s early design stage, the approach demonstrated in this paper facilitates the practical spatial planning and provides insights into designing WCSs in a desert landscape.",1361-9209,Not found
Mitigating roadside noise pollution: A comparison between rounded and sinusoidal milled rumble strips,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.006,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Shoulder or centerline rumble strips (RS) generate noise and vibration to alert drivers when they are departing the travel lane. Although inexpensive to install, easy to maintain, and have documented safety benefits, RS are not installed on many roadway segments primarily due to noise concerns of nearby property owners. This study evaluated the feasibility of using sinusoidal RS as a substitute for rounded milled RS on roadway segments in Oregon (U.S.A.) with lane-departure crash problems. Exterior sound levels generated by rounded and sinusoidal RS strikes were compared to baseline sound levels for three vehicle types (passenger car, van, and heavy vehicle) to establish sound generation and alerts of the two designs. A total of 39 vehicle strikes of RS were recorded in a controlled field experiment. Rumble strip strikes by the passenger car and van generated less exterior noise with the sinusoidal (3.1 dBA) than with the rounded (passenger car: 5.4 dBA, van: 4.6 dBA) design. Results for the heavy vehicle were complicated due to bridging of the narrower rounded rumble strip by the tires. The wider cut of the sinusoidal RS generated a clearly detectable increase in exterior roadside noise for the heavy vehicle.",1361-9209,Not found
The comparative CO<inf>2</inf> efficiency of short sea container transport,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.025,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"European transport policies have over the last decades advocated the CO2 efficiency of maritime transport relative to road haulage, and consequently, shipping reaping the benefits of being considered the green mode of freight transport. To date, research focusing on CO2 emissions from ships has to a great extent followed a modeling approach, based on a set of more or less well-founded assumptions. Yet these presumptions raise questions regarding the reliability of the emission results presented and the foundation of which transport policies are built upon. In an attempt to broaden the discussion, this paper presents CO2 emissions that have been calculated based on data from actual container feeder operations in Europe over a full year of service. Through the development of origin-destination matrices representing these real container flows, a mode-comparative analysis of CO2 efficiency is undertaken by constructing a counterfactual road transport alternative serving the same market. Although the results generally corroborate the environmental superiority of short sea container shipping with respect to CO2 efficiency, the comparative edge seems to be marginal in some scenarios. Thus, highlighting the need for shipping services to obtain a fairly high capacity utilization in order to still represent the green mode of transport in terms of CO2 emissions.",1361-9209,Not found

Conceptual framework of life-cycle performance measurement: Ensuring the resilience of transport infrastructure assets,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.002,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Having efficient and effective transport infrastructure (e.g. bridges, roads, railways, airways and tunnels) in place is essential for supporting the economic and social well-being of an economy. External disturbances that emerge as a result of climate change, for example, are impacting its performance. Delivering, managing and maintaining transport assets that are resilient and adaptive to changing environmental conditions have become a priority for many governments worldwide. Central to ensuring that transport infrastructure functions at their optimum and is resilient to external changes is performance measurement, as it enables those processes that need to be modified and improved for enhancing the asset’s adaptability throughout their lifecycle to be identified. Despite the importance of performance measurement in ensuring the resilience of transport infrastructure, it has received limited attention by governments in their policy making. Therefore, this paper provides a review of the extant literature and proposes a life-cycle resilient performance measurement framework (PMF) within transport context. The developed PMF is robust in comprehensively capturing the underlying perspectives that are significant for: (1) understanding the current state of the resilient level of transport assets; and (2) enabling a higher ability of the assets to adapt to environment-related changes in the future.

A decision-support framework for emergency evacuation planning during extreme storm events,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.024,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Developing an effective real-time evacuation strategy during extreme storm events such as hurricanes has been a topic of critical significance to the emergency planning and response community. The spatial and temporal variabilities of inland flooding during hurricanes present significant challenges for robust evacuation planning. In this study, a framework for real-time evacuation planning was developed that combines the results obtained from hydrodynamic modeling and traffic microsimulation. First, a fine-scale hydrodynamic model was developed based on depth-averaged 2D shallow-water equations (SWE) to obtain information pertaining to flood depth and velocity for planning evacuation routes during a storm event. Next, a traffic microsimulation was conducted using time-dependent information from the hydrodynamic model regarding the traffic velocities along evacuation routes during an event. An optimization technique was also implemented to reduce the overall travel time by about 6% from that of the base model. The last component of the framework involves combining the results from both models to generate a time-lapse animation of emergency evacuation based on a geographic information system (GIS). The results obtained using this framework could be easily accessed by the general public and decision-makers to enable efficient evacuation planning during extreme storm events.",1361-9209,Not found
Fuzzy real options and shared savings: Investment appraisal for green shipping technologies,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.016,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Shipping finds itself at the beginning of a greening process that leads to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) objective of a 50% cut on the 2008 levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions until 2050.

Most research is focused on those abatement measures including policies, while partially neglecting financing issues. This article addresses this research gap by assessing the impact of financing concepts on the overall net present value (NPV) of a greening technology. Therefore, the latest green shipping research is reviewed, and the Fuzzy Pay-Off Method (FPOM) and the Center of Gravity-FPOM (CoG-FPOM) are applied.

Impacts of weather on cycling and walking on twin trails in Seattle,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.022,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Active travel is associated with various health, environmental, social, and economic benefits. However, barriers exist in active travel activities and promotion. In particular, cycling and walking tend to be more severely affected by inclement weather than encapsulated modes, such as passenger and transit vehicles. This study analyzes the impacts of weather and climate conditional changes on the usage of twin multi-use trails in Seattle, United States. Both comparative analysis and residual regression analysis methods are used to examine the impacts. The buffered effects of rainfall on cycling and walking are particularly investigated. The findings indicate that at the daily level, weather conditions are more influential on active travel on the two trails on weekdays than on weekends. Nevertheless, cyclists and pedestrians on weekdays tend to be more resilient to weather influence than weekend riders and walkers at the hourly level. Cycling could be more severely influenced by weather condition changes than walking, especially on weekdays. The concurrent rainfall not only affects the concurrent active travel, but it also affects the usage of trails 1 h earlier. Comparatively, the delay effects of rainfall on active travel can last a longer period of time for cycling on weekdays. Note that self-selection in a time-series data analysis, particularly at a finer temporal scale, must be controlled.

In this study, we developed a tsunami-induced, network-wide traffic evacuation optimization strategy. A hierarchical evacuation structure is established to guide vehicle routing decisions. At the first stage of evacuation, the optimization objective is to minimize the maximum evacuation time for all the individual evacuees from affected areas to temporary shelter zones to satisfy their primary safety needs within the shortest time periods. At the second stage of evacuation, the optimization objective aims to minimize the total evacuation time of all the evacuees from temporary shelter zones to safe zones. The lexicographic minimax optimization and Tabu search techniques are adopted to obtain a unique solution. Numerical examples are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model based on a real transportation network in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The impact on accessibility to employment is analyzed using a dataset of sea-level increases merged with road network (TIGER) data and Census data on population and employment. Using measures of accessibility, it is shown how access will be reduced at the block-group level. An additional analysis of low and high income quartiles suggest that lower-income block groups will have greater reductions in accessibility. The implication is that increasing sea levels will have large impacts on people and the economy, and large populations will have access to employment disrupted well before their own properties or places of employment may begin to flood (assuming no adaptation).",1361-9209,Not found
Observing transient behavior during Hurricane Sandy through passively collected data,10.1016/j.trd.2019.09.025,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Transients, such as tourists or business travelers, often fly into large cities and subsequently have to rely on public transportation for movement within the city. It is difficult to observe transient behavior in the event of a disaster through traditional survey methods. Thus, transient behavior has not been understood as well as resident behavior, which presents a challenge to emergency management. This study used taxi trip records that are passively collected year-round in New York City (NYC) to observe transient behavior during Hurricane Sandy (2012). The linkage between transients and taxi trips was built upon the fact that many transients choose hotels as accommodation and depend on taxis during their travel in NYC. This study extracted and analyzed taxi trips originating from hotels shortly before and after the hurricane landfall, which cover transient outbound activities in a week. In the pre-landfall period, it was found that transients who evacuated out of Manhattan were more likely to leave hotels about 18–24 h before hurricane landfall; and those who stayed made more shopping trips within Manhattan. In the post-landfall period, transients were more likely to relocate on the second day after hurricane landfall; some transients headed to local airports once limited service was resumed. This is believed to be the first study to use passively collected data to observe transient travel behavior in the event of a hurricane as well as on normal days.",1361-9209,Not found

Using agent-based modeling to evaluate the effects of Hurricane Sandy's recovery timeline on the ability to work,10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.011,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Hurricane Sandy greatly disrupted the New York City (NYC) region’s transportation systems, electric power systems, work locations, and schools in 2012. This study uses survey responses from NYC Metropolitan Area residents to develop an agent-based model that depicts commuter travel behavior and adaptation after the disruption. Six scenarios were tested to quantify which systems were more critical to recover for an earlier return to productivity - defined as the ability to work for one’s employer. The recommended system restoration order depends on the pattern of normal commuting behavior. In the NYC Metropolitan Area, a larger share of commuters use transit to commute than in any other US metropolitan area. This resulted in the model indicating the subway/rail system recovery as the most important factor for returning the most people to productivity. The second most important factor is widespread power restoration itself, which allows residents to telework while waiting for the transportation system to recover. The next most important factor is the reopening of schools and daycares (with associated infrastructure systems), freeing parents to commute. The remaining expedited system recovery scenarios tested using the agent-based model resulted in a faster return to productivity than the baseline, but to a lesser degree than the subway/rail, power, and childcare systems scenarios. Additional analysis of recovery shows that households with higher annual income benefit more from power recovery compared to those with lower incomes. Moreover, the effectiveness of recovery scenarios can differ based on residential location and the extent of disruption in that location.",1361-9209,Not found

Although recent studies demonstrate profound weather effects on mobility in single case study areas, international cross-comparisons are required to reveal how effects differ between cities with different transport and climate regimes. This paper provides an international cross-comparison of the simultaneous effects of weather on destination choices, distances, trip chaining, and transport modes in the urban regions of Utrecht (Netherlands), Oslo and Stavanger (Norway), and Stockholm (Sweden). Hereto, regional subsamples of national travel survey data were linked to meteorological records for the three respective countries and analysed in generalised Structural Equation Models. Our findings generally indicate that light, calm, dry and warm atmospheric conditions may positively affect cycling and the selection of outdoor leisure destinations, while cold and to a lesser extent wet and windy weather conditions reduce cycling and enhance car use and travel optimising strategies like trip chaining, to reduce weather exposures. A positive effect of air temperature on cycling flattens out above 20–25 °C in most of our study areas, but hot weather does not seem to reduce cycling strongly. However, our findings also show considerable regional differences in the effects of weather on mobility.

These extreme weather events could also affect urban mobility, since people who walk or bike may shift to public transit or avoid travel if they cannot afford a vehicle. To address these concerns, this study examines the effects of extreme weather events on bus ridership and the extent to which this relationship varies by income and destination. This study analyzes highly detailed micro-level bus data between 2012 and 2017 for a county in the Pacific Northwest using a negative binomial regression model. Results suggest modest reductions in bus ridership on very hot and cold days, as well as on days with heavy rainfall, with impacts differing between weekdays and weekends. Findings also show that bus ridership is more sensitive to extreme weather events in lower-income areas relative to the wealthiest neighborhoods, which may be partly driven by a large university student population who can ride the bus for free. Finally, results show that bus ridership around commercial areas and parks increases on very cold days and days with heavy precipitation, reinforcing the importance of public transit during these weather events. These results suggest extreme weather events affect urban mobility, with greater impacts in lower-income neighborhoods, parks and commercial areas. Transit agencies and policymakers should consider ways to increase accessibility and mobility during these weather events, especially for lower-income households.",1361-9209,Not found

To enable efficient resource allocation during natural disasters, managers need to know what citizens are experiencing and where. During Hurricane Irma in 2017 in Florida over six million people were asked to evacuate. The hurricane caused widespread damage. We utilized geospatial and machine learning techniques to categorize geolocated tweets, which were both about Hurricane Irma and located within Florida. We employed sentiment analysis to classify tweets about damage and/or transportation into negative, neutral, or positive groups. We used the American Community Survey (ACS) 2017 geography to provide socio-economic context, and relied on a multinomial logit specification to examine which features of the tweet, tweeter, or location were likely to be associated with negative or positive sentiments. We found that longer tweets were more likely to have useful sentiment-based content. We also discovered that popular tweeters were likely to tweet positive sentiments, and that popular tweets were less likely to have useful information about the disaster. The ACS backdrop suggested that the likelihood of tweets with negative sentiments was higher in census block groups with younger families. The probability of tweets with useful positive or negative sentiments dropped in locations with higher property values or median rents. This paper offers a methodology for extracting information embedded within social media data, and suggests ways to develop a probability-based understanding of needs to guide disaster managers.",1361-9209,Not found
How can the UK road system be adapted to the impacts posed by climate change? By creating a climate adaptation framework,10.1016/j.trd.2019.02.007,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This paper aims to analyse the impacts of climate change to the current and predicted future situations of road transportation in the UK and evaluate the corresponding adaptation plans to cope with them. A conceptual framework of long-term adaptation planning for climate change in road systems is proposed to ensure the resilience and sustainability of road transport systems under various climate risks such as flooding and increased temperature. To do so, an advanced Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning (FBR) model is first employed to evaluate the climate risks in the UK road transport networks. This modelling approach can tackle the high uncertainty in risk data and thus facilitate the development of the climate adaptation framework and its application in the UK road sector. To examine the feasibility of this model, a nationwide survey is conducted among the stakeholders to analyse the climate risks, in terms of the timeframe of climate threats, the likelihood of occurrence, the severity of consequences, and infrastructure resilience. From the modelling perspective, this work brings novelty by expanding the risk attribute “the severity of consequence” into three sub-attributes including economic loss, damage to the environment, and injuries and/or loss of life. It advances the-state-of-the-art technique in the current relevant literature from a single to multiple tier climate risk modelling structure. Secondly, an Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach is used to prioritise the best adaptation measure(s) by considering both the risk analysis results from the FBR and the implementation costs simultaneously. The main new contributions of this part lie in the rich raw data collected from the real world to provide useful practical insights for achieving road resilience when facing increasing climate risk challenges. During this process, a qualitative analysis of several national reports regarding the impacts posed by climate change, risk assessment and adaptation measures in the UK road sector is conducted for the relevant decision data (i.e. risk and cost). It is also supplemented by an in-depth interview with a senior planner from Highways England. The findings provide road planners and decision makers with useful insights on identification and prioritisation of climate threats as well as selection of cost-effective climate adaptation measures to rationalise adaptation planning.",1361-9209,Not found
Modeling the resilience of an airline cargo transport network affected by a large scale disruptive event,10.1016/j.trd.2019.02.011,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"This paper presents modeling the resilience of an airline cargo transport network affected by a given (large scale) disruptive event. The airports represent the nodes and the air routes and flights between them the links of the network. Modeling implies synthesizing a methodology consisting of two sets of the analytical models: (a) a generic (existing) analytical model for assessing the resilience of particular airports, routes/links, and the entire network; and (b) the new analytical models of the selected indicators of the network’s performance used as the FOMs (Figures-Of-Merit) for assessing the corresponding resilience. These indicators of performance include: (i) the airline flights; (ii) the airline transport work; (iii) the airline profits; (iv) the value of time of transported air cargo shipments; and (v) the inventory cost of air cargo shipments at the network nodes/airports. Such proposed methodology enabling assessment of the resilience of affected network over time, i.e., prior, during, and after the impact of a given disruptive event, has been applied to the real airline cargo network (FedEx Express, U.S.) affected by the large scale disruptive event (extreme snowstorm - the so-called nor’easter) characterized by its duration, intensity, and spatial scale.

Assessing seismic vulnerability of urban road networks by a Bayesian network approach,10.1016/j.trd.2019.02.003,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Evaluating the seismic vulnerability of urban road network is important for proactive reinforcement of the weakest link of the road network and post-disaster response and recovery of infrastructure systems. The paper proposes a Bayesian network (BN) method for seismic vulnerability assessment of an urban road network considering spatial seismic hazard with different levels of ground motion intensities, vulnerability of the components and effect of structural damage of components within the road network to the network functionality. Seismic vulnerability of the components in the road network is quantified based on physical structural damage under the earthquake demand. The vulnerability of the network is evaluated in terms of its dis-connectivity due to structural damage and induced transportation functional loss. BN model is built with vulnerability of the components as prior probability. The BN structure and CPT (Conditional Probability Table) is established based on transportation network analysis. The dis-connectivity of the road network is updated in light of information obtained from the observation of system or component states. Thus, the posterior probability could be calculated to identify the critical links and assess the seismic vulnerability of road network respectively. A case study is presented to show the application of the method. Results may contribute to the decision making on the reinforcement of the road network and the management of available resources to improve the disaster resilience and functionality of transportation systems in terms of seismic vulnerability.",1361-9209,Not found
Optimal levee installation planning for highway infrastructure protection against sea level rise,10.1016/j.trd.2019.02.002,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Sea level rise predictions have motivated research towards the protection of shoreline infrastructures, including transportation systems. Transportation network interactions in cases of inundation can lead to severe disruptions that cause capacity and accessibility reduction and thus considerable delays, especially due to congestion feedback, because congestion occurring due to an inundated link or a link that becomes isolated through inundation of one of its nodes can lead to delays in other parts of the network, due to queue spillback or traffic rerouting. This paper describes a decision tool to support infrastructure protection planning against sea level rise. A simulation-based optimization model is designed to minimize delays occurring in a transportation system under inundation. The model considers budget constraints, hydrodynamic interactions within the shoreline, as well as traffic assignment in the network. The case study focuses on San Francisco Bay area, for a 0.5 m sea level rise that is expected in 2054 and may increase highway users’ travel time by 37%. The results show that the optimal strategies vary according to the available budget, and that there exist relatively critical shorelines to protect in order to reduce the traffic disruptions. We anticipate our research to provide a general framework for transportation infrastructure protection planning against sea level rises.",1361-9209,Not found
Evacuation decision behavior for no-notice emergency events,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.025,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"No-notice emergency events refer to unpredictable disasters such as earthquakes, chemical spills, or terrorist attacks, where it is impracticable to forewarn the public about their occurrence and design evacuation plans for them. This calls for an in-depth investigation of people’s evacuation behavior and identifying the most influential factors in their evacuation planning process to develop policy-sensitive pre-disaster plans for such events. As a response to this need, the current study investigates individuals’ evacuation decision behavior in the context of no-notice emergency events. Since it is highly expected that people will have heterogenous decision behavior in such situations, we first apply a clustering algorithm to classify them into three maximally homogeneous clusters. Then, cluster-specific multivariate ordered probit models are developed to estimate the likelihood of selecting any of the three options of ignoring the situation, seeking shelter at the place, and evacuating to a safe place. The model estimation results indicate that a wide spectrum of factors affect the evacuation decision including individuals’ socio-economic attributes, disaster characteristics, built-environment factors, and government evacuation order. Further, variations of estimated coefficients across the population clusters highlight the significant dissimilarities in decision behavior of their associated members.",1361-9209,Not found
An indicator-based methodology for assessing resilience in urban mobility,10.1016/j.trd.2019.01.004,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"Resilience is an increasingly more important concept to understand the response urban systems are able to deliver to endogenous and exogenous shocks in the current context of climate change and socioeconomic uncertainty. Urban mobility, a fundamental component of urban systems, is naturally sensitive to shocks with significant impacts on daily life of individuals and businesses. The concept of resilience in urban mobility is under intensive research with increasingly more sophisticated approaches and methods being developed to assess resilience in transport modes due to different shocks. The literature is, however, absent on applications aimed at using simpler mobility indicators that are used and validated in urban mobility planning processes in the context of lack of data or expertise. We propose a resilience evaluation method that uses commonly available origin–destination (OD) datasets to evaluate an overall indicator of resilience. We consider the possibility of trips made in motorised modes to be transferred to active modes in the event of a disruption of the mobility system. Results of the application of the method to two urban areas in Brazil show that each one has a specific pattern of mode change that is related to the OD patterns. The spatial distribution of trips shows the relative importance of resilient trips in the urban area. Finally, different levels of income have different sensitivity to the variation of resilience.",1361-9209,Not found
"Streets, storm surge, and the frailty of urban transport systems: A grid-based approach for identifying informal street network connections to facilitate mobility",10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.024,77,2019-12-01,2019,12,"A variety of real-world infrastructure systems, including power grids, telecommunications, roads and social networks can be conceptualized and modeled using basic concepts from graph theory and network science. The abstraction of real-world systems into an edge-node topology enables analysts to quantify and characterize a range of network properties, including structure, connectivity, and modularity, as well as the attributes of individual nodes and edges such as degree, criticality, and betweenness. One major problem with the abstraction process associated with traditional network analysis is that edges and nodes are stripped of important proximal, contextual information that is critical for understanding how network elements operate in situ. For example, the geographic context of an elevated causeway is significantly different than a landlocked residential street, yet they are both simply represented as edges in traditional network modeling. The purpose of this paper is to explore the implications associated with network abstractions, including the loss of geographic fidelity, and why it matters for vulnerability analysis and emergency response during extreme events. Specifically, this paper introduces an alternative network conceptualization that preserves important on-network information, but also provides in situ context for local network elements, helping to deepen our understanding of local operating conditions. A case study for hurricane storm surge flooding in Volusia County, Florida is utilized to highlight how the developed approach better captures the realities of how evacuees and emergency response teams can leverage information for both on- and off-network space during a major disaster.",1361-9209,Not found
Real-world gaseous emission characteristics of Euro 6b light-duty gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102215,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"To accurately investigate vehicle emissions that have become major contributors to global air pollutants and greenhouse gases, test conditions have been transferred from laboratory type approval test cycles to real-world driving conditions. In this study, the real-world driving emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (THC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2) from one gasoline and two diesel Euro 6b light-duty passenger vehicles were investigated by a portable emission measurement system (PEMS) in Lyon, France. NOx and CO2 emission controls remain critical to addressing the real-world driving emissions of Euro 6b vehicles. Notably, the tested gasoline vehicle emitted higher CO2 emissions than diesel vehicles on all types of roads, especially on the urban road with an excess of 29.3–48.3%. The highest emission factors of gaseous pollutants generally occurred on the motorway for the gasoline vehicle, while on the urban road for diesel vehicles. In particular, for high-speed driving conditions, the gasoline vehicle gaseous emissions, especially NOx emissions, were more affected by acceleration than diesel vehicle emissions. In addition, the CO emissions, especially THC emissions, for the gasoline vehicle, were more influenced by warm-start, especially cold-start, than those for diesel vehicles.",1361-9209,Not found

We also investigate the related relationship between profitability and disclosure using an instrumental variables strategy. Lastly, we examine the interaction between competition and profits. Our results show the probability of large American airlines disclosing direct repair costs after a wildlife strike event are linked to market competition and profitability.

Charging infrastructure demands of shared-use autonomous electric vehicles in urban areas,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102210,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Ride-hailing is a clear initial market for autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) because it features high vehicle utilization levels and strong incentive to cut down labor costs. An extensive and reliable network of recharging infrastructure is the prerequisite to launch a lucrative AEV ride-hailing fleet. Hence, it is necessary to estimate the charging infrastructure demands for an AEV fleet in advance. This study proposes a charging system planning framework for a shared-use AEV fleet providing ride-hailing services in urban area. We first adopt an agent-based simulation model, called BEAM, to describe the complex behaviors of both passengers and transportation systems in urban cities. BEAM simulates the driving, parking and charging behaviors of the AEV fleet with range constraints and identifies times and locations of their charging demands. Then, based on BEAM simulation outputs, we adopt a hybrid algorithm to site and size charging stations to satisfy the charging demands subject to quality of service requirements. Based on the proposed framework, we estimate the charging infrastructure demands and calculate the corresponding economics and carbon emission impacts of electrifying a ride-hailing AEV fleet in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also investigate the impacts of various AEV and charging system parameters, e.g., fleet size, vehicle battery capacity and rated power of chargers, on the ride-hailing system’s overall costs.",1361-9209,Not found
Economic benefits of introducing LNG-fuelled ships for imported flour in South Korea,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102220,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"As the concerns about air pollution have steadily increased, the perception that ships are the source of pollutants and toxic emissions is also expanding. Thus, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is tightening maritime regulations to reduce air pollution from ships. Currently, the government and related industries are trying to replace heavy fuel oil with liquefied natural gas (LNG) to counter future IMO regulations. Since the use of LNG is expected to increase costs, it is necessary to estimate the social benefits to determine the legitimacy of the replacement. The purpose of this study is to analyse the public’s willingness to pay (WTP) for products imported in LNG-fuelled ships using the contingent valuation method. Flour, the most of which is currently imported in South Korea, is chosen as the subject of empirical analysis. As a result, the mean additional WTP was KRW 571 (USD 0.51) per kg. This value corresponds to about 36% of the existing flour price. Therefore, South Korean households are willing to pay a considerable premium on the flour imported via LNG-fuelled ships. These results can serve as useful bases for future LNG bunkering-related policies.",1361-9209,Not found

In addition, we have implemented a load aggregation method based on the features revealed by a clustering process. This aggregation method simulates the electricity demand of an arbitrary number of charging stations, all of which are connected to the main feeder of a building. Several scenarios are simulated using charging stations and building demand data from the University of British Columbia campus in Vancouver.

Optimal development of alternative fuel station networks considering node capacity restrictions,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.018,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"A potential solution to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the transport sector is the use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFV). As global GHG emission standards have been in place for passenger cars for several years, infrastructure modelling for new AFV is an established topic. However, as the regulatory focus shifts towards heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), the market diffusion of AFV-HDV will increase as will planning the relevant AFV infrastructure for HDV. Existing modelling approaches need to be adapted, because the energy demand per individual refill increases significantly for HDV and there are regulatory as well as technical limitations for alternative fuel station (AFS) capacities at the same time. While the current research takes capacity restrictions for single stations into account, capacity limits for locations (i.e. nodes) – the places where refuelling stations are built such as highway entries, exits or intersections – are not yet considered. We extend existing models in this respect and introduce an optimal development for AFS considering (station) location capacity restrictions. The proposed method is applied to a case study of a potential fuel cell heavy-duty vehicle AFS network. We find that the location capacity limit has a major impact on the number of stations required, station utilization and station portfolio variety.",1361-9209,Not found
Eco-routing problem considering fuel consumption and probabilistic travel time budget,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102219,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Road transportation is one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. To reduce energy consumption and alleviate this environmental problem, this study aims to develop an eco-routing algorithm for navigation systems. Considering that both fuel consumption and travel time are important factors when planning a trip, the proposed routing algorithm finds a path that consumes the minimum amount of gasoline while ensuring that the travel time satisfies a specified travel time budget and an on-time arrival probability. We first develop link-based fuel consumption models based on vehicle dynamics, and then the Lagrangian-relaxation-based heuristic approach is proposed to efficiently solve this NP-hard problem. The performance of the proposed eco-routing strategy is verified in a large-scale network with real travel time and fuel consumption data. Specifically, a sensitivity analysis of fuel consumption reduction for travel demand and travel time buffer is discussed in our simulation study.",1361-9209,Not found
Indoor air quality and passenger thermal comfort in Beijing metro transfer stations,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102217,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"In this study, particulate matter was investigated as the primary pollutant in the air quality of Beijing Metro transfer stations, and passenger thermal comfort during the transfer process was evaluated by using the relative warmth index (RWI). Passenger thermal comfort level is not ideal in 87% of the measured space and is slightly hot overall, with an RWI range of 0.20–0.43. Although 20% of the measured space has lower values than ASHRAE’s cooling comfort class, the thermal comfort level of most measured space is good in winter morning rush hours, with an RWI range from −0.18 to 0.28. The particulate matter (PM) concentration is related not only to the season and spatial depth but also to the transfer design of the metro station. During the morning rush period, the concentration ranges difference of PM10 and PM2.5 in winter are 262.9 μg/m3 and 125.5 μg/m3, respectively, which are 1.43 and 1.46 times higher than those of in summer. There are significant differences in the PM concentration and RWI values between the island and lateral platforms of Beijing Metro transfer stations, and the design of the lateral platform is superior to that of the island platform. Another exploratory experiment is conducted to determine if the PM concentration has a potential effect on human metabolic rate. The data in this paper provide a valuable reference for further comfort research and environmental control in metro station, and the conclusions may guide the further underground space design of metro transfer stations.",1361-9209,Not found
Sources and exposure risk of trace elements for traffic policemen in roadside locations,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.005,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Samples of PM2.5 and PM10 at four types of roadside location (major road, secondary road, branch road, and expressway) in Tianjin were collected and analyzed in 2015. The average annual roadside PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were higher than the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS: GB3095-2012). The chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), and cadmium (Cd) concentrations in both PM2.5 and PM10 over four seasons displayed significant differences (p < 0.05). An enrichment factor (EF) analysis revealed that Cd, copper (Cu), Zn, As, Ni, and Pb in PM2.5 and PM10 mainly originated from anthropogenic sources. A factor analysis (FA) and correlation analysis (CA) revealed that vehicle emissions (exhaust and non-exhaust), soil dust, coal combustion, and industrial emissions were the main sources of roadside PM2.5 and PM10 in Tianjin. Both the total hazard quotients (total HQ) and the total carcinogenic risk (total CR) for selected elements in PM2.5 and PM10 were within acceptable limits. The HQ of Pb was higher than for other metals, and it should therefore be given special attention. The CR for traffic policemen was highest for Cr exposure (1.01 × 10−5 for PM2.5 and 1.52 × 10−5 for PM10), followed by As and Ni. A sensitivity analysis showed that the total contributions of the metal concentrations, exposure time (ET), and exposure frequency (EF) accounted for over 50% of the risk for Cr, As, and Ni, suggesting that these metals had the greatest impact on the uncertainty of health risk assessments.",1361-9209,Not found
Planning transport for social inclusion: An accessibility-activity participation approach,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102212,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Social equity is increasingly becoming an important objective in transport planning and project evaluation. This paper provides a framework and an empirical investigation in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) examining the links between public transit accessibility and the risks of social exclusion, simply understood as the suppressed ability to conduct daily activities at normal levels. Specifically, we use a large-sample travel survey to present a new transport-geography concept termed participation deserts, neighbourhood-level clusters of lower than expected activity participation. We then use multivariate models to estimate where, and for whom, improvements in transit accessibility will effectively increase activity participation and reduce risks of transport-related social exclusion. Our results show that neighbourhoods with high concentrations of low-income and zero-car households located outside of major transit corridors are the most sensitive to having improvements in accessibility increase daily activity participation rates. We contend that transit investments providing better connections to these neighbourhoods would have the greatest benefit in terms of alleviating existing inequalities and reducing the risks of social exclusion. The ability for transport investments to liberate suppressed activity participation is not currently being predicted or valued in existing transport evaluation methodologies, but there is great potential in doing so in order to capture the social equity benefits associated with increasing transit accessibility.",1361-9209,Not found
Modeling travel mode choice of young people with differentiated E-hailing ride services in Nanjing China,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102216,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"E-hailing ride service (ERS) has become increasingly popular globally and is changing the urban mobility landscape. There is insufficient research effort in understanding the impact of ERS on travel behavior, in particular among young people. This paper aims to start filling that research gap by first collecting mode choice preference data through a stated preference survey in City of Nanjing, China and then applying nested logit (NL) models and a series of post-estimation analysis to address a number of key research questions of mode choice behavior without and with ERS. Three ERS modes are considered in the Chinese context: DiDi Taxi (D-Taxi), DiDi Express (D-Express), and DiDi Premier (D-Premier), all provided by DiDi Chuxing, the dominant ERS service provider in China. The study finds that age makes little difference in mode choice preference when ERS is introduced between the two age groups considered (18–30 and 31–45). The study results also suggest that young travelers are naturally drawn to ERS for what it represents (a technology innovation) and its business (pricing) model. ERS appears to be a competitive alternative to the conventional modes especially when they are under performed. The study also finds that ERS will likely increase vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) considerably, which will lead to increase in on-road vehicular emissions, unless some mechanism to switch users to ridesharing is in place.",1361-9209,Not found

Moreover, these sustainable alternatives need to offer sufficient levels of accessibility regardless of where people live or work. We present and discuss an approach for capturing and evaluating perceived accessibility, with the ability to differentiate between individuals. Levels of perceived accessibility are compared before and after a fictive car use restriction, and between residential areas, using data from 2711 residents of Malmö, Sweden. A main conclusion is that levels of perceived accessibility become significantly lower for car users when they are limited in their options for daily travel. The difference is more substantive for frequent car users, who already travel less by sustainable modes today. There are also significant differences in levels of perceived accessibility in the restricted scenario, depending on where individuals live. These novel findings may not come as a surprise, but they emphasize the importance of including and analyzing perceptions of car users when designing accessible and sustainable transport systems.

Comparison of energy demands of drone-based and ground-based parcel delivery services,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102209,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Drones are one of the most intensively studied technologies in logistics in recent years. They combine technological features matching current trends in transport industry and society like autonomy, flexibility, and agility. Among the various concepts for using drones in logistics, parcel delivery is one of the most popular application scenarios. Companies like Amazon test drones particularly for last-mile delivery intending to achieve both reducing total cost and increasing customer satisfaction by fast deliveries. As drones are electric vehicles, they are also often claimed to be an eco-friendly mean of transportation. In this paper an energy consumption model for drones is proposed to describe the energy demand for drone deliveries depending on environmental conditions and the flight pattern. The model is used to simulate the energy demand of a stationary parcel delivery system which serves a set customers from a depot. The energy consumed by drones is compared to the energy demand of Diesel trucks and electric trucks serving the same customers from the same depot. The results indicate that switching to a solely drone-based parcel delivery system is not worthwhile from an energetic perspective in most scenarios. A stationary drone-based parcel delivery system requires more energy than a truck-based parcel delivery system particularly in urban areas where customer density is high and truck tours are comparatively short. In rather rural settings with long distances between customers, a drone-based parcel delivery system creates an energy demand comparable to a parcel delivery system with electric trucks provided environmental conditions are moderate.",1361-9209,Not found

Larger, denser, mixed-use, and more walkable MXDs show a larger share of trips internally, compared with conventional suburban developments. Those MXDs with good access to transit, employment, and destinations also show higher levels of walking, biking, and transit shares on external trips, thus helping to reduce traffic impacts on the external road network. Perhaps the most impressive finding is that well-designed MXDs have walk shares of more than 50 percent on internal trips.

Analysis of the effect of charging needs on battery electric vehicle drivers’ route choice behaviour: A case study in the Netherlands,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102206,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Electric travelling appears to dominate the transport sector in the near future due to the needed transition from internal combustion vehicles (ICV) towards Electric Vehicles (EV) to tackle urban pollution. Given this trend, investigation of the EV drivers’ travel behaviour is of great importance to stakeholders including planners and policymakers, for example in order to locate charging stations. This research explores the Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) drivers route choice and charging preferences through a Stated Preference (SP) survey. Collecting data from 505 EV drivers in the Netherlands, we report the results of estimating a Mixed Logit (ML) model for those choices. Respondents were requested to choose a route among six alternatives: freeways, arterial ways, and local streets with and without fast charging. Our findings suggest that the classic route attributes (travel time and travel cost), vehicle-related variables (state-of-charge at the origin and destination) and charging characteristics (availability of a slow charging point at the destination, fast charging duration, waiting time in the queue of a fast-charging station) can influence the BEV drivers route choice and charging behaviour significantly. When the state-of-charge (SOC) at the origin is high and a slow charger at the destination is available, routes without fast charging are likely to be preferred. Moreover, local streets (associated with slow speeds and less energy consumption) could be preferred if the SOC at the destination is expected to be low while arterial ways might be selected when a driver must recharge his/her car during the trip via fast charging.",1361-9209,Not found
Modal shift implications of e-bike use in the Netherlands: Moving towards sustainability?,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102202,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"This paper investigates the modal shift patterns of e-bike users in the Dutch context. We focus on the change in e-bikers’ travel behavior to assess whether this change benefits sustainability. Our study provides direct ecologically valid evidence on modal shift by using a longitudinal dataset from the Netherlands Mobility Panel survey. We examine e-bikers’ modal shift patterns before and after acquiring an e-bike. The findings indicate that after e-bike adoptions, conventional bike use reduces significantly, while car use reduces less strongly. Nonetheless, the share of car kilometers is much larger than that of conventional bikes at the baseline. Besides, the emission rate per passenger kilometer of an e-bike is several times lower than that of a car. These imply a net environmental gain after e-bike adoptions. The present study also sheds light on modal shifts at a disaggregated level by investigating those e-bikers who are more likely to drive less after e-bike adoption. The findings suggest that e-bikers younger than 50 and those around retirement age (60–69) seem more likely to step out of their cars. Additionally, people living in rural areas tend to be more likely to reduce their car use than their counterparts in highly urbanized areas.

Using GPS-data to determine optimum electric vehicle ranges: A Michigan case study,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102203,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Fuel-switching personal transportation from gasoline to electricity offers many advantages, including lower noise, zero local air pollution, and petroleum-independence. But alleviations of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are more nuanced, due to many factors, including the car’s battery range. We use GPS-based trip data to determine use type-specific, GHG-optimized ranges. The dataset comprises 412 cars and 384,869 individual trips in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. We use previously developed algorithms to determine driver types, such as using the car to commute or not. Calibrating an existing life cycle GHG model to a forecast, low-carbon grid for Ann Arbor, we find that the optimum range varies not only with the drive train architecture (plugin-hybrid versus battery-only) and charging technology (fast versus slow) but also with the driver type. Across the 108 scenarios we investigated, the range that yields lowest GHG varies from 65 km (55+ year old drivers, ultrafast charging, plugin-hybrid) to 158 km (16–34 year old drivers, overnight charging, battery-only). The optimum GHG reduction that electric cars offer – here conservatively measured versus gasoline-only hybrid cars – is fairly stable, between 29% (16–34 year old drivers, overnight charging, battery-only) and 46% (commuters, ultrafast charging, plugin-hybrid). The electrification of total distances is between 66% and 86%. However, if cars do not have the optimum range, these metrics drop substantially. We conclude that matching the range to drivers’ typical trip distances, charging technology, and drivetrain is a crucial pre-requisite for electric vehicles to achieve their highest potential to reduce GHG emissions in personal transportation.",1361-9209,Not found

Individuals who live in areas with lower annual income are both (i) more likely to drive vehicles that fail emissions inspections at a higher average rate, and (ii) more likely to fail emissions inspections conditional on vehicle characteristics. The top income quintile fails emissions inspections 20% less often than the bottom income quintile even when controlling for observable vehicle characteristics. This implies that owner characteristics, in addition to observable vehicle characteristics, have a non-negligible impact on vehicle emissions rates.

A sample of 1100 Swedish residents was analysed for the effect of variables related to accessibility, usual commute mode and attitudes. Significant variables were used to create a precondition index, which was cross-tabulated with demographic variables and stages drawn from the transtheoretical model. The results show that there are differences in the preconditions regarding motivation to reduce private car use between segments of the population. Results indicate that climate morality is the most critical factor affecting motivation, specifically the motivation of persistent drivers. Usual commute mode, car advocacy, health concern, attitudes towards cycling, car identity and travel time also influence motivation. Males, the middle-aged, people with low educational attainment, and rural residents have the least favourable preconditions concerning motivation to reduce private car use.",1361-9209,Not found
Effects of a hovering unmanned aerial vehicle on urban soundscapes perception,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.024,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Several industry leaders and governmental agencies are currently investigating the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or ‘drones’ as commonly known, for an ever-growing number of applications from blue light services to parcel delivery. For the specific case of the delivery sector, drones can alleviate road space usage and also lead to reductions in CO2 and air pollution emissions, compared to traditional diesel-powered vehicles. However, due to their unconventional acoustic characteristics and operational manoeuvres, it is uncertain how communities will respond to drone operations. Noise has been suggested as a major barrier to public acceptance of drone operations in urban areas. In this paper, a series of audio-visual scenarios were created to investigate the effects of drone noise on the reported loudness, annoyance and pleasantness of seven different types of urban soundscapes. In soundscapes highly impacted by road traffic noise, the presence of drone noise lead to small changes in the perceived loudness, annoyance and pleasantness. In soundscapes with reduced road traffic noise, the participants reported a significantly higher perceived loudness and annoyance and a lower pleasantness with the presence of the same drone noise. For instance, the reported annoyance increased from 2.3 ± 0.8 (without drone noise) to 6.8 ± 0.3 (with drone noise), in an 11-point scale (0-not at all, 10-extremely). Based on these results, the concentration of drone operations along flight paths through busy roads might aid in the mitigation of the overall community noise impact caused by drones.",1361-9209,Not found
Estimating mortality impacts from vehicle emission reduction efforts: The Tune In and Tune Up program in the San Joaquin Valley,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.019,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"As a response to profoundly poor air quality and associated environmental justice concerns in the San Joaquin Valley region in California, the Tune In & Tune Up (TI&TU) program provides residents with free vehicle emissions testing and vouchers for smog repair. We used data on approximately 19,000 repaired TI&TU vehicles from 2012 to 2018, and several estimation techniques, to quantify a range of nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions prevented as a result of the program. We then calculated resulting mortality impacts from reduced exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the form of secondary nitrates. After applying a novel smog repair emissions abatement depreciation function, we find that six years of operation of the TI&TU program has reduced NOX emissions by approximately 53–302 tons by the end of 2018. Using a concentration response function for ambient PM2.5, we found that between 0.055 and 0.31 premature deaths have also been avoided. We present multiple methods for assessing public health impacts, which can be used as guidance for evaluating similar transportation-based emission reduction programs.",1361-9209,Not found
Exhaust emissions generated under actual operating conditions from a hybrid vehicle and an electric one fitted with a range extender,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.012,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"The paper describes exhaust emission tests performed on a PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) and a BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle), in which the combustion engine was used as a range extender. The measurements of the exhaust emissions were performed for CO2/fuel consumption, CO, THC and NOx. The RDE measurements were performed including the engine operating parameters and emissionsanalysis. This analysis shows that the engines of BEVs and PHEVs operate in a different parameter range when under actual operating conditions, which directly translates into the exhaust emission values. This is particularly the case for the emission of NOx. The investigations were carried out for two routes differentiated by the length and share of the urban and extra-urban cycles. For both routes, the emission of THC and CO were lower for the PHEV engine – HC by 69% (22 mg/km, route 1) and 6% (15 mg/km, route 2), CO by 69% (0.12 mg/km, route 1) and 80% (0.1 mg/km, route 2). For route 1, characterized by a greater share of the urban cycle, the emission of NOx was lower by 70% (2 mg/km) for the BEV engine, and (route 2) lower by 60% (8 mg/km) for the PHEV engine. Additionally, the curves of the exhaust emissions in time for individual exhaust components have been presented that indicate that in the motorway cycle the emission of THC and CO from the BEV vehicle increases significantly up to ten times compared to urban cycle.",1361-9209,Not found

This paper aimed to develop a traffic noise prediction model for mountainous cities. In China, the traffic noise prediction model HJ 2.4-2009, which itself is based on the sound pressure level corrected for roadway gradients (RGs), has been receiving widespread acceptance. On the basis of the model in HJ 2.4-2009, the RG correction coefficient was proposed to modify the original model and a per-vehicle noise prediction model was built using a multilayer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) model. The data collected from a municipal road of a hilly city, Chongqing, was used to train and validate the ANN model. The predictor variables comprised the per-vehicle noise value, vehicle type, vehicle velocity, and roadway gradient. The results showed that the modified HJ 2.4-2009 model incorporating the gradient correction coefficient achieved a significantly higher R2 for mountainous cities than the original model.

Customers’ selections between premium electric taxis and liquefied petroleum gas taxis,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.001,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Reducing roadside emissions is a common challenge in metropolitan cities. In Hong Kong, conventional liquefied petroleum gas taxis are one of the main contributors to roadside emissions as they operate on the streets 24 h a day with a long daily driving mileage. Moreover, these taxis suffer from a severely poor service reputation. To enhance the environmental friendliness and service quality of the taxi industry, this study explores the market potential of operating premium electric taxis in the dispatching mode. A stated preference survey was conducted to 1410 taxi customers about their taxi-riding choices between premium electric taxis and conventional liquefied petroleum gas taxis. In total, 5640 observations were obtained and used to develop a series of binary logistic regression models with different model formulations for the determination of the significant factors influencing customers’ selections. The findings indicate that walk time to and wait time for taxis were the most critical concerns to the customers, and they were more willing to take premium taxis if their journey distance was longer and their desired improvement on taxi service quality was greater. The socio-demographic status of taxi customers also influences their choices. The associated policy implications are discussed for promoting taxis with better service quality and fewer roadside emissions. The findings provide some policy insights to other international cities that have a similar taxi market to Hong Kong.",1361-9209,Not found
Smart charging management for shared autonomous electric vehicle fleets: A Puget Sound case study,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.013,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Increasingly, experts are forecasting the future of transportation to be shared, autonomous and electric. As shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) fleets roll out to the market, the electricity consumed by the fleet will have significant impacts on energy demand and, in turn, drive variation in energy cost and reliability, especially if the charging is unmanaged. This research proposes a smart charging (SC) framework to identify benefits of active SAEV charging management that strategically shifts electricity demand away from high-priced peak hours or towards renewable generation periods. Time of use (TOU), real time pricing (RTP), and solar generation electricity scenarios are tested using an agent-based simulation to study (1) the impact of battery capacity and charging infrastructure type on SAEV fleet performance and operational costs under SC management; (2) the cost reduction potential of SC considering energy price fluctuation, uncertainty, and seasonal variation; (3) the charging infrastructure requirements; and (4) the system efficiency of powering SAEVs with solar generation. A case study from the Puget Sound region demonstrates the proposed SC algorithm using trip patterns from the regional travel demand model and local energy prices. Results suggest that in the absence of electricity price signals, SAEV charging demand is likely to peak the evening, when regional electricity use patterns already indicate high demand. Under SC management, EVs with larger battery sizes are more responsive to low-electricity cost charging opportunities, and have greater potential to reduce total energy related costs (electricity plus charging infrastructure) for a SAEV fleet, especially under RTP structure.",1361-9209,Not found
Identification of neighborhood typology for potential transit-oriented development,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.015,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"While a good number of studies have defined neighborhood typologies based on transit-oriented development (TOD) factors, the literature offers limited clues for the identification of neighborhood types that are likely to be designated as TODs. The present study fills this gap through the use of a cluster-multilevel modeling approach for examining the underlying effects of urban structure on travel behavior among different neighborhood types. A two-step cluster analysis on spatial data from 47 neighborhoods of the Delhi metropolitan region has resulted in six neighborhood types. The study verifies the developed typology through the analysis of significant differences in terms of socio-demographic, and travel behavior variables, and found that the typology is valid. Besides, individual multilevel regression (MLR) models were developed using 5553 individual responses from all neighborhoods of typology. The MLR models were evident that the urban structure has an apparent effect and explains about one-third of the total variation in the distance traveled, assuming that other factors such as residential self-selection, land values, and environment may explain the remaining effects. This study has identified that the ‘transit’ type has shown consistent relationships between urban structure and vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT), thereby replicate TOD as a concept. The findings from the study are useful as a prescription tool for planners, policymakers, and government authorities to compare the performance of TOD characteristics within existing and planned neighborhoods. The modeling results are easy to be interpreted and are transferable to other Indian cities.",1361-9209,Not found
Eco-driving behaviors of electric vehicle users: A survey study,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.017,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Previous research has shown that electric vehicle (EV) users could behave differently compared to internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) drivers due to their consciousness or practices of eco-driving, but very limited research has fully investigated this assumption. This research explores this topic through investigating EV drivers’ eco-driving behaviors and motivations. We first conducted a questionnaire survey on EV drivers’ driving behavior and some hypothetical decisions of their driving. It indicates various characteristics between EV and ICEV commuters, including self-reported daily driving habits, preferences of route choices, tradeoff between travel time and energy saving, and adoption of in-vehicle display (IVD) technologies. Then, through statistical analysis with Fisher’s exact test and Mann-Whitney U test, this research reveals that, compared to ICEV drivers, EV drivers possess significantly calmer driving maneuvers and more fuel-efficient driving habits such as trip chaining. The survey data also show that EV drivers are much more willing to save energy in compensation of travel time. Furthermore, the survey data indicate that EV drivers are more willing to adopt eco-friendly IVD technologies. All these findings are expected to improve the understanding of some unique behavior found in EV drivers.",1361-9209,Not found
Decomposition analysis of decoupling freight transport from economic growth in China,10.1016/j.trd.2019.12.003,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Freight transport industry plays a significant role in boosting economic growth, while also creating many negative externalities for social welfare and the environment. Using data from 1997 to 2017, this study employs the complete decomposition technique to identify the driving forces of freight transport and explores its internal relations with economic growth in China. The decomposition analysis focuses on four factors that are responsible for freight transport: economic activity, industrial structure, transport intensity, and haulage distance. Then, the decoupling index is adopted to examine the decoupling relationship between freight transport and economic growth in China. The results showed that weak decoupling between freight transport and economic growth was the main state during the study period. A strong decoupling effect was identified in 1997–1998, 2012–2013, and 2014–2015, whereas no decoupling effect was observed in 1998–1999, 2008–2009, and 2011–2012. The transport intensity was the most important contributor to the decoupling progress, the industrial structure effect played a role in promoting the decoupling progress over half of the years during the research period, and the haulage distance effect facilitated the decoupling progress in more than one-third of the years examined.",1361-9209,Not found
Consumer preferences for battery electric vehicles: A choice experimental survey in China,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.014,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"To accelerate the diffusion of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), consumer preferences for different products and policy attributes must be determined. Although previous studies have investigated consumer preferences for some product attributes, including purchase price, operation cost, driving range, and charging time, limited studies have discussed the broader aspects of product attributes, such as battery warranty and depreciation rate. Moreover, market-oriented incentives, including the personal carbon trading (PCT) scheme and the tradable driving credits (TDC) scheme, can theoretically be effective alternatives to expensive purchase subsidies. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence that confirms the influence of these two schemes on BEV adoption. To fill these gaps, we conducted a stated preference choice experimental survey in China and investigated the effect of product attributes, existing policy incentives, and two emerging market-oriented incentives on BEV adoption. Our results reveal that along with the main product attributes, battery warranty has a significant positive effect on inducing mainstream consumers to adopt BEVs while no preference difference occurs among existing policy incentives after purchase subsidies are abolished. For young consumers, almost all incentives that reduce the operation cost (e.g., PCT) or increase convenience (e.g., TDC) can increase their adoption of BEVs. These findings can provide important implications for the government with regard to designing novel incentives and promoting BEV adoption.",1361-9209,Not found
Public charging infrastructure for plug-in electric vehicles: What is it worth?,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.011,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Lack of charging infrastructure is an important barrier to the growth of the plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) market. Public charging infrastructure has tangible and intangible value, such as reducing range anxiety or building confidence in the future of the PEV market. Quantifying the value of public charging infrastructure can inform analysis of investment decisions and can help predict the impact of charging infrastructure on future PEV sales. Estimates of willingness to pay (WTP) based on stated preference surveys are limited by consumers’ lack of familiarity with PEVs. As an alternative, we focus on quantifying the tangible value of public PEV chargers in terms of their ability to displace gasoline use for PHEVs and to enable additional electric (e−) vehicle miles for BEVs, thereby mitigating the limitations of shorter range and longer recharging time. Simulation studies provide data that can be used to quantify e-miles enabled by public chargers and the value of additional e-miles can be inferred from econometric estimates of WTP for increased vehicle range. Functions are synthesized that estimate the WTP for public charging infrastructure by plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles, conditional on vehicle range, annual vehicle travel, pre-existing charging infrastructure, energy prices, vehicle efficiency, and household income. A case study based on California’s public charging network in 2017 indicates that, to the purchaser of a new BEV with a 100-mile range and home recharging, existing public fast chargers are worth about $1500 for intraregional travel, and fast chargers along intercity routes are valued at over $6500.",1361-9209,Not found

Competitive strategies for original equipment manufacturers considering carbon cap and trade,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.022,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"This paper considers an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) faces competition from an independent remanufacturer (IR) and they both are regulated by carbon cap and trade policy (CTP). We develop models to explore the OEM’s optimal competitive strategy in the face of IR’s competition and environmental regulation. We first investigate the impact of CTP on the OEM and IR. Then, we analyze three competitive strategies that the OEM may choose: remanufacturing, fixed-fee licensing, and royalty licensing. We investigate their optimal decisions under each strategy and identify the conditions under which these strategies can coordinate the OEM and IR. Finally, we explore conditions under which one strategy is superior to another. The results show that the OEM is worse off when competing with the IR under CTP if the carbon cap allocated to the OEM is small. Fixed-fee licensing and royalty licensing can coordinate the OEM and IR not only from an economic perspective but also from an environmental perspective. The OEM’s optimal competitive strategy is determined by thresholds of three critical parameters: the fixed cost of setting up a remanufacturing system, the fixed-fee, and the per-unit royalty. We provide specific guidance on strategy selection for the OEM.",1361-9209,Not found
The allocation problem of electric car-sharing system: A data-driven approach,10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.021,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Car-sharing is an emerging transportation mode with increasing applications of electric vehicles (EVs). One of the important issues for one-way electric car-sharing systems (ECS) is unbalanced vehicle distributions and high relocation costs. To improve its efficiency and overall profit, this research proposes a data-driven optimization model with the consideration of demand uncertainty. Firstly, a large amount of historical order data from an ECS company are analyzed to characterize the dynamics of the vehicles and the behavioral features of the users. An important observation is that the daily demand by users, i.e., pick-ups, follows Poisson distribution; and the arrival rates vary across time exhibiting four major temporal stages. Based on this observation, this research constructs the ECS reallocation problem as a data-driven optimization model which is a combination of a probability expectation model and a linear programming problem with real-time data as input. More importantly, different from existing research, this research formulates the profit as the mathematical expectation of a discrete random variable with uncertain consumer demands. This allows for a comprehensive consideration of all possible future demands. Furthermore, driving range constraint has been considered in the proposed model as EV is the focus of this paper. A linear solution method is proposed to obtain the global optimal. At the end, the model is validated using real data from 30 ECS stations. The results indicate the daily improvement of profit could be as high as 19.05% with an average of 10.16%.",1361-9209,Not found
Are young Americans carless across the United States?

This study performs a spatial analysis to examine the potentially non-stationary relationships between sociodemographic factors and vehicle ownership. Consistent with previous studies, modeling results from this study showed that young Americans are more likely to be carless than older adults. The spatial analysis answers the research question – in which regions(s) young Americans are even less likely to have a car. The results highlighted the Northeast states for the young American’s extra-lower vehicle ownership if the influences of all other factors are held constant. The cost of living and availability of transportation alternatives are possible reasons. Further, this study built separate models for young adults (25–34 years old) and three older age groups. The vehicle ownership correlates within the young adults are found to be generally consistent with the correlates among all adults. Among young adults, vehicle ownership is still significantly related to their gender, educational attainment, employment status, household characteristics, and travel demand. However, young adults’ vehicle ownership seems to be less sensitive to household income than mid-age adults’ (35–44 years old), perhaps because young people may not perceive financial stress such as child support and mortgage. This study contributes by using a spatial analysis approach to reveal the non-stationary correlates of vehicle ownership. This approach is useful for future travel behavior research and transportation policy considering the spatial heterogeneity.",1361-9209,Not found

However, the studies of PM data from a limited number of monitoring stations have not fully accounted for variations in regional PM concentration. Furthermore, consideration of only one of two key urban characteristics may not provide a complete picture of the relationship. Hence, the primary goal of this study is to estimate the effects of both land cover and transportation on the PM 2.5 concentration indicated by satellite imagery. Focusing on the Texas Triangle region, we implemented diverse transportation measures with Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques and land cover measures with remotely sensed imagery at the census tract level.

"Electric vehicle charging station locations: Elastic demand, station congestion, and network equilibrium",10.1016/j.trd.2019.11.008,78,2020-01-01,2020,1,"Battery-only electric vehicles (BEVs) generally offer better air quality through lowered emissions, along with energy savings and security. The issue of long-duration battery charging makes charging-station placement and design key for BEV adoption rates. This work uses genetic algorithms to identify profit-maximizing station placement and design details, with applications that reflect the costs of installing, operating, and maintaining service equipment, including land acquisition. Fast electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are placed across a congested city's network subject to stochastic demand for charging under a user-equilibrium traffic assignment. BEV users’ station choices consider endogenously determined travel times and on-site charging queues. The model allows for congested-travel and congested-station feedback into travelers’ route choices under elastic demand and BEV owners’ station choices, as well as charging price elasticity for BEV charging users. Boston-network results suggest that EVCSs should locate mostly along major highways, which may be a common finding for other metro settings. If 10% of current EV owners seek to charge en route, a user fee of $6 for a 30-min charging session is not enough for station profitability under a 5-year time horizon in this region. However, $10 per BEV charging delivers a 5-year profit of $0.82 million, and 11 cords across 3 stations are enough to accommodate a near-term charging demand in this Boston-area application. Shorter charging sessions, higher fees, and/or allowing for more cords per site also increase profits generally, everything else constant. Power-grid and station upgrades should keep pace with demand, to maximize profits over time, and avoid on-site congestion.",1361-9209,Not found

Therefore, as a first step, the influence of simulated car traffic noise on real rent prices in the study area in question is analyzed and compared to existing studies. It is shown that modeled noise values from the transportation model are able to explain significant impacts on rent prices when using a hedonic pricing regression. When using noise as a continuous variable, price discounts of 0.4% per dB(A) are found. A discount of up to 9.6% for particularly loud locations is estimated when noise is used as a categorical variable. Care should be taken when controlling for accessibilities that may correlate with noise.

Then, a variational inequality problem is formulated to model the equilibrium of EV traffic on transportation networks, and an optimal power flow model is proposed to model the power network flow with PV power plants and optimally serve the EV charging requirements. Based on the above models for describing system states, we then formulate a model to simultaneously design charging stations, PV plants, and time-dependent charging fee.

We hypothesized that animal proximity to the road, group size, vehicle approach, and ambient conditions would affect perceived risk by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to vehicle approach, as measured by flight-initiation distance (FID). We constructed a priori models for FID, as well as road-crossing behavior. Deer responses were variable and did not demonstrate spatial or temporal margins of safety. Road-crossing behavior was slightly and positively influenced by group size during winter. Deer showed greater FIDs and likelihood of crossing when approached in the road; directionality of approach likely increased the perceived risk.

While plug-in behavior can differ among PEV owners based on their travel patterns, preferences, and access to infrastructure studies often make generalizations about charging behavior. In this study, we explore differences in charging behavior among different types of PEV owners based on their use of charging locations and levels, we then identify factors associated with PEV owner’s choice of charging location and charging level. We identified socio-demographic (gender and age), vehicle characteristics, commute behavior, and workplace charging availability as significant factors related to the choice of charging location.",1361-9209,Not found
Comparison of “Advanced” biofuel cost estimates: Trends during rollout of low carbon fuel policies,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102211,79,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Costs of producing “advanced” biofuels (those with the lowest GHG and land use impacts) have not decreased in recent years as envisioned by analysts. Despite aggressive policy incentives, no transition to a lower cost mature industry has occurred. Information about the cost dynamics and slow industry emergence is of major interest to policymakers and others seeking to understand the likely success – and cost – of incentive programs. This paper reviews literature on production cost at the plantgate – without considering taxes or delivery costs – for selected biofuel technology pathways using a levelized cost of fuel approach, applying common financing assumptions for capital amortization and converting all values to year 2016 dollars, and examines results in the current low carbon fuel policy context. The average production cost estimate for cellulosic ethanol was $4 per gallon-gasoline equivalent (gge). For drop-in fuels, the pyrolysis-biocrude-hydro treatment pathway had the lowest average production cost estimate at about $3.25/gge. Biomass to liquid (BTL) production cost estimates averaged $3.80/gge, while hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) – the sole fuel studied gaining commercial traction – averaged about $3.70/gge. Estimate ranges did not allow any definitive rank ordering of the fuels by production cost. Production cost estimates are higher in later than in earlier publications for non-HEFA fuels due primarily to higher costs for feedstock and capital expenditure components. This may reflect learning from early but largely unsuccessful commercialization efforts that yielded more realistic (and higher cost) information and detail on feedstock provision and conversion processes.",1361-9209,Not found
Consumer intentions for alternative fuelled and autonomous vehicles: A segmentation analysis across six countries,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102243,79,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Rapid advances in the development of autonomous and alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs) are likely to transform the future of mobility and could bring benefits such as improved road safety and lower emissions. Achieving these potential benefits requires widespread consumer support for these disruptive technologies. To date, research to explore consumer perceptions of transport innovations has tended to consider them in isolation (e.g., driverless cars, electric vehicles). The current paper examines the predictors of consumer interest in and willing to pay for both AFVs and autonomous vehicles through a choice experiment conducted in six diverse markets: Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, UK and US. Using Latent Class Discrete Choice Models, we observe significant heterogeneity both within and across the country samples. For example, while Japanese consumers are generally willing to pay for autonomous vehicles, in most European countries, consumers need to be compensated for automation. Within countries, though, we found some segments – typically, those with a university degree, and self-identifying as having a pro-environmental identity and as being innovators– are more in favour of automation. Significantly, we also found that support for autonomous vehicles is associated with support for AFVs, perhaps, due to common demographic or socio-psychological predictors of both types of innovative technology. These findings are valuable for policymakers and the automotive industry in identifying potential early adopters, as well as consumer segments or cultures less convinced to adopt these innovative transport technologies.",1361-9209,Not found
How can shipowners comply with the 2020 global sulphur limit economically?,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102234,79,2020-02-01,2020,2,"To comply with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2020 global sulphur limit for maritime shipping, low-sulphur fuel oils (LSFOs) and scrubbers are the most commonly applied approaches in practice, as a result of which, however, shipowners’ profits will be affected. This paper is to identify a more economical sulphur reduction approach, for which a 19,000 twenty-foot equivalent unit container ship sailing between Far East and Europe is set as a case study. Using the cost-benefit analysis, the use of scrubbers is proved to be more economical due to the higher net present value and lower annual unit cost. The sensitivity check suggests that a scrubber is more attractive in most cases except for two scenarios where LSFOs are more popular. That is, a scrubber is losing its attractiveness when prices of LSFOs and heavy fuel oil (HFO) move in the same direction with the price spread is equal to or below US$56 per ton, and when prices of HFO rise and prices of LSFOs fall with the price spread is equal to or below US$16 per ton. This finding well explains the current popularity of installing scrubbers among shipowners although retrofitting still faces many challenges.",1361-9209,Not found
"Integrating e-scooters in urban transportation: Problems, policies, and the prospect of system change",10.1016/j.trd.2020.102230,79,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Throughout the world, cities seek to ease transport-related problems of congestion, air pollution, noise, and traffic injuries. Urban transport planners have welcomed e-scooters as an alternative to motorized individual transport, specifically the car. The public has met e-scooters with both enthusiasm and scepticism, as cities have struggled with unforeseen outcomes such as forms of irresponsible riding, cluttering, or vandalism. This paper investigates the challenges associated with the introduction of e-scooters in ten major cities, based on a content analysis of local media reports. News items (n = 173) were identified through Internet searches and include print media, TV and radio websites. Concerns prior to and after the introduction of e-scooters are assessed, analysed, and interpreted in the context of new policies for this transport mode. Results suggest that many cities have moved through trial and error stages in their search for appropriate legislation. The paper concludes that it is prudent for urban planners to introduce policies regarding maximum speeds, mandatory use of bicycle infrastructure, and dedicated parking, as well as to limit the number of licensed operators. Where negative public opinion can be averted, e-scooters stand a chance to become a disruptive niche innovation with the potential to transform urban transport systems.",1361-9209,Not found
Fleeing from hurricane Irma: Empirical analysis of evacuation behavior using discrete choice theory,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102227,79,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper analyzes the observed decision-making behavior of a sample of individuals impacted by Hurricane Irma in 2017 (n = 645) by applying advanced methods based in discrete choice theory. Our first contribution is identifying population segments with distinct behavior by constructing a latent class choice model for the choice whether to evacuate or not. We find two latent segments distinguished by demographics and risk perception that tend to be either evacuation-keen or evacuation-reluctant and respond differently to mandatory evacuation orders. Evacuees subsequently face a multi-dimensional choice composed of concurrent decisions of their departure day, departure time of day, destination, shelter type, transportation mode, and route. While these concurrent decisions are often analyzed in isolation, our second contribution is the development of a portfolio choice model (PCM), which captures decision-dimensional dependency (if present) without requiring choices to be correlated or sequential. A PCM reframes the choice set as a bundle of concurrent decision dimensions, allowing for flexible and simple parameter estimation. Estimated models reveal subtle yet intuitive relations, creating new policy implications based on dimensional variables, secondary interactions, demographics, and risk-perception variables. For example, we find joint preferences for early-nighttime evacuations (i.e., evacuations more than three days before landfall and between 6:00 pm and 5:59 am) and early-highway evacuations (i.e., evacuations more than three days before landfall and on a route composed of at least 50% highways). These results indicate that transportation agencies should have the capabilities and resources to manage significant nighttime traffic along highways well before hurricane landfall.",1361-9209,Not found

From willingness to action: Do push-pull-mooring factors matter for shifting to green transportation?,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102242,79,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Motivating individuals to choose green transportation is becoming increasingly important. Based on push-pull-mooring framework, this study aims to explore how push, pull and mooring factors foster individual’s willingness to shift to green transportation. This study also analyzes the role of information provision in narrowing the gap between shifting willingness and behavior. The findings revealed that push factors, including perceived environmental threats and perceived inconvenience, drive individual’s mode-shift away from private cars, whereas the pull factors, including green transport policies and campaigns, and green transport system attract individual’s mode-shift to green transportation. Moreover, the mooring factor, namely inertia, not only negatively affects individual’s shifting willingness but also negatively moderates the effects of push and pull factors on individual’s shifting willingness. In addition, shifting willingness positively affects the shifting behavior and the information provision positively moderates the relationship among them. Such findings are vital to achieve the realization of China’s low-carbon goals.",1361-9209,Not found

Based on 120 taxi drivers’ natural driving data during 4 months, driving behavior data under various conditions of the roadway, traffic, weather, and time of day are extracted. The driver's fuel consumption is directly collected by the on-board diagnostics (OBD) unit, and safety index is calculated based on Data Threshold Violations (DTV) and Phase Plane Analysis with Limits (PPAL) considering speed, longitudinal and lateral acceleration. By using a linear mixed model explaining the fixed effect of the external conditions and the random effect of the driver, the influences of various external factors on fuel consumption and safety are analyzed and discussed.

Electric vehicles and residential parking in an urban environment: Results from a stated preference experiment,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102222,79,2020-02-01,2020,2,"This paper presents the results of a preference survey of 1545 respondents’ willingness to purchase electric vehicles (EVs) in Philadelphia. We pay particular attention to respondents’ willingness to pay for convenient charging systems and parking spaces. If the value of dedicated parking substantially outweighs the value of convenient charging systems, residential-based on-street charging systems are unlikely to ever be politically palatable. As expected, respondents are generally willing to pay for longer range, shorter charging times, lower operating costs, and shorter parking search times. For a typical respondent, a $100 per month parking charge decreases the odds of purchasing an EV by around 65%. Across mixed logit and latent class models, we find substantial variation in the willingness to pay for EV range, charge time, and ease of parking. Of note, we find two primary classes of respondents with substantially different EV preferences. The first class tends to live in multifamily housing units in central parts of the city and puts a high value on parking search time and the availability of on-street charging stations. The second class, whose members are likelier to be married, wealthy, conservative, and residing in single-family homes in more distant neighborhoods, are willing to pay more for EV range and charge time, but less for parking than the first group. They are also much likelier to consider purchasing EVs at all. We recommend that future research into EV adoption incorporate neighborhood-level features, like parking availability and average trip distances, which vary by neighborhood and almost certainly influence EV adoption.",1361-9209,Not found
Decouple transport CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from China's economic expansion: A temporal-spatial analysis,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102225,79,2020-02-01,2020,2,"China’s transport industry is energy intensive and high-polluting. While with the surging urbanization and the development of service industry, China’s economic relies more and more on the transport sector. Therefore, exploring the relationship between transport energy-related carbon emission (TECE) and economic development is crucial to the realization of China’s “Post Paris” mitigation target. The paper carries out a decoupling research between TECE and Gross domestic product (GDP) at both national level and province level based on Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition analysis with the extended Kaya identity and Tapio decoupling model. The model quantifies eight factors’ effects on the relationship with focusing on external macro socio-economic related factors (i.e., spatial pattern, urbanization, per capita service industry output value, reciprocal of the service industry’s share of GDP, and demographic variable) successfully. The key conclusions are indicated as follows: (1) the national decoupling status was extensive coupling during 2004–2010 and then weak decoupling during 2010–2016. The progress can be attributed to the decline of energy intensity. (2) Per capita service output was always the prominent factor to promote carbon emissions growth in different time periods and provinces with inhibiting the advancement of decoupling process, followed by urbanization.

Are French millenials less car-oriented? Literature review and empirical findings,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102221,79,2020-02-01,2020,2,"Generation effects play a key role in shaping long-term trends in travel behaviors. Though cohorts born until the 1970s have been increasingly car-focused, a reversal of this trend was noticed among the millenials. Determining whether this break-in-trend resulted from changes in living conditions and economic difficulties, or demonstrates a shift in attitudes away from the car, is critical to future travel trends. We bring a contribution to this debate in the French context, through a literature review followed by empirical findings, using the French Base of Local Household Travel Surveys. Through age-cohort analysis, we find evidence of changing travel patterns among the millenials, taking the form of a shift from driving to transit, along with a decline of car ownership. However, travel attitudes of the millenials play little role, as they do not differ substantially from their elders. Besides, we show that generation effects disappear once a large number of structural factors are controlled for. It looks like the main driver of change in travel behaviors comes from a shift in residential patterns, in relation with longer studies and a delayed entrance into the workforce, and possibly because of increasing work pressure, degraded transport conditions and changes in residential attitudes and desired lifestyles. In the end, these assumptions should be further explored, along with complementary research tracks, including the role of economic factors, the effects of learning experience, as well as heterogeneity in travel patterns, in relation with issues of social and spatial equity.",1361-9209,Not found

In this article, we develop a transportation policy to handle air pollution caused by the heavy flow of traffic in urban areas. In particular, we aim to distribute the traffic flow more evenly through a city, by developing a flow algorithm that computes multiple solutions, each of which accommodates the maximum flow. The paper makes the following contributions to build such a transportation policy: (a) Develops a Pareto-optimal Max Flow Algorithm (PMFA) to suggest multiple max flow solutions. (b) Introduces the notion of k-optimality into PMFA to ensure that the suggested pareto solutions are sufficiently distinct from each other – referred to as Pareto-k-optimal Max Flow Algorithm (k-PMFA).

We study the VAMO scheme located in Fortaleza, Brazil, as the first e-carsharing scheme in the country. We study two policies combined: a VAMO planned growth policy and a retirement policy for conventional vehicles. Our results show that the VAMO incentive policy is an important factor to reduce emissions and to increase awareness of electric vehicles, highlighting the role of the government as an institutional entrepreneur, stimulating and sustaining the VAMO scheme. The retirement policy in combination with the VAMO incentive policy obtained the best results in our simulations, reducing 29% of CO2 emissions and increasing 36% electric vehicle adoption, when compared to the business-as-usual scenario. The main conclusions are that such e-carsharing schemes offer direct and indirect benefits to urban mobility (specially to electric vehicle adoption) and that they depend on how the government supports them.",1361-9209,Not found

Based on a propensity score matching and difference-in-difference analysis, we found no evidence of a decrease in PM10 concentrations in cities after they implemented driving restrictions. This finding may be attributed to an increase in the number of cars in these cities after implementing driving restrictions, but we also found no evidence of an improvement in air quality for a given number of cars after implementation of the policies.",1361-9209,Not found

Do high income households reduce driving more when living near rail transit?,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102244,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Transportation planning today requires an understanding of how income and near-rail residence jointly influence household travel behavior. This article fills a gap in the literature by showing how vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and transit trips taken (TT) vary with income and rail transit access by neighborhood type. Results indicate that, when comparing households with similar incomes and examining how the “near-rail” versus “far from rail” VMT and TT gap varies by income, the cross-sectional reduction in nominal VMT and the increase in TT on a percentage basis is generally larger for higher-income households (>$50,000), and particularly so in neighborhoods dense with both jobs and population. These findings offer support for the notion that near-transit housing targeting higher-income households can have both sustainability and transit use benefits. We note, though, that equity considerations are a strong reason to include low-income housing near rail transit, and argue that policies focusing overly singly on either low-income or high-income housing near rail transit will not be as impactful as a robust focus on mixed-income housing developments in rail transit-oriented developments (TODs).",1361-9209,Not found

Such an assessment is required in order to provide policymakers with guidance on if and how real-time trading services can serve as a tool to incentivize e-vehicle ownership. We propose a fully reproducible simulation model of the value creation process of real-time trading services, and use the model to assess services with a range of e-vehicle provider characteristics as well as with a range of technology setups. Our empirical results show that all considered real-time trading services are able to create significant energy cost savings, and that overall cost savings strongly depend on technology characteristics, surcharge rate, as well as on the e-vehicle provider's commute, household size, and office hours. We show that services including solar energy generation have the largest economic potential but do not necessarily maximize renewable energy deployment with residential households.

Our results show that the impact of accessibility on public transport mode share is stronger and non-linear for the low-income group especially in the largest metropolitan areas, where increasing accessibility past a certain optimal value will lead to a decrease in public transport mode share. However, this point occurs at the 80th percentile of existing accessibility, so improvements in mode share are nonetheless expected with improved accessibility in most areas within these regions. Moreover, in regions where an optimal value is not readily observed, improved accessibility throughout the region would lead to increased uptake of public transport for both the higher- and to a greater extent, the low-income group. Findings from this paper can be of value to transport professionals working towards meeting ridership goals around the world as comparisons between groups and across regions highlight the variation in the impacts of accessibility on mode share.",1361-9209,Not found
Dynamic calculation of ship exhaust emissions based on real-time AIS data,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102277,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"The activity-based methodology is becoming an increasing way to calculate exhaust emissions from ships in a port.

This article proposes a method of dynamic calculation of ship exhaust emissions based on real-time ship trajectory data. Firstly, real-time ship AIS messages are partitioned into continuous data blocks and go through a series of pre-processing operations, including trajectory extraction, association and interpolation. Ship activity parameters are then determined by database querying and regression analysis based on ship attributes. Subsequently, an improved activity-based methodology is employed to estimate exhaust emissions from ships in a distributed way. Based on the grid model, regional ship exhaust emissions can be statistically and dynamically calculated by the spatial allocation of all ship emissions. In a case study, a real-time monitoring platform for ship exhaust emissions in Shenzhen port is developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",1361-9209,Not found

Previous studies have shown that the urban form at the city scale has affected active transport in Chinese cities.

This research investigates the four most representative neighborhood types found in Chinese cities: traditional mixed-use, slab block work-unit, gated community, and resettlement housing. Household travel diaries conducted in Chengdu in 2016 were analyzed using binary logistic regressions, supplemented by informal onsite interviews. The findings indicate significant variations in the use and accessibility of active transport in each neighborhood type for non-work trips. This suggests that each neighborhood type may need different strategies for promoting active transport: (1) the traditional mixed-use neighborhoods are in need of intensified urban retrofitting projects to reclaim public open space; (2) the work-unit could benefit from comprehensive plans rather than a patchwork of projects; (3) while opening up gated communities can improve porosity across neighborhoods and promote active transport, the more pressing issue may be their inability to keep up with the transportation needs of the residents; and (4) residents of resettlement housing should have better access to employment using transit and non-motorized modes.",1361-9209,Not found

This paper evaluates the conceptual issues and policy salience of megaregional planning in the U.S. by analyzing the results of a 2018 survey of 382 designated MPOs. Drawing upon the survey results, we find support for the notion that MPO partnerships operating at the megaregional scale are somewhat widespread and involve MPOs along with other partners, like state DOTs and councils of governments. A subset of common concerns—especially multi-modal freight, major transportation corridors, economic development, intercity rail service, and air quality—appear to motivate megaregional partnerships. MPOs were most likely to engage in megaregion-scale collaborations requiring relatively low levels organizational time and resources versus more substantive collaborative efforts to develop joint plans or coordinated project investments. At the same time, few MPO respondents viewed megaregional scale planning collaborations as a high priority or as highly effective. For the majority of MPOs, it appears likely that the costs of such collaborations currently outweigh prospective benefits. Survey respondents identified increasing staff funding, requiring state DOTs’ statewide plans to address megaregional issues, and facilitating and enabling inter-local agreements for megaregional planning as actions that would enhance the salience and effectiveness of megaregional planning. These actions will likely occur only if planning at this scale is embraced as an important priority by federal and state policy makers.",1361-9209,Not found

The results show the savings in both energy and basic CO2 emissions alongside the discussion of Return on Investment (RoI) that can be achieved through the potential installation of ESS at identified ideal locations along the tram network. Moreover, this may be extended to the use of EVs as stationary ESS sited at the existing P&R facilities. Further, the model may also be used to inform future infrastructure upgrades and potential improvements to air quality within urban environments.",1361-9209,Not found
Travel attitudes and mode use among Asian international students at an Australian university,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102259,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"International students and immigrants in general are fuelling the growth in Australia’s population and the pressure that is putting on its urban transport systems. Yet, we know very little about their travel habits and limited previous research has been previously undertaken to address this gap. To address this research need, this study draws on a survey that was designed and distributed online and on-campus to students at Australia’s largest university (Monash University). Using multivariate statistical tools including factor analysis and multinomial logistic regression, significant differences were found between native-born Australian and Asian international students with regards to their mode perceptions, present travel habits and socio-demographics. For Asian students, attitudes towards non-car mode decrease and car-dependency increases the longer they reside in Australia. The findings of this research further highlight the need to encourage newer immigrants to use more sustainable travel options and highlight the relevance for local government and policy planners to support further research in this area, given that these international students have the potential to be key agents for travel behaviour change.",1361-9209,Not found
Evaluating household residential preferences for walkability and accessibility across three U.S. regions,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102255,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Accessibility has been established as a major planning goal in recent years. However, little knowledge exists regarding how individuals value walkability, transit accessibility, and auto accessibility differently when deciding where to live. To fill this knowledge gap, this study conducts residential location choice modeling across three U.S. regions—Atlanta, Puget Sound, and Southeast Michigan. I find that, overall, all three types of accessibility are important determinants of residential location choice. Transit accessibility has a statistically significant positive influence on residential location choice across all three regions. On auto accessibility, results show that commute time by auto has the greatest influence on residential location choice among all independent variables, but auto accessibility to nonwork destinations appears to be inconsequential. Moreover, walkability is found to be a key determinant of residential location choice in the Puget Sound region but not the other two regions. I argue that these regional differences result from a lack of choice among Atlanta and Southeast Michigan residents, that is, a undersupply of walkable neighborhoods inhibits households in the two regions from living in such neighborhoods. This finding suggests the need for cities and regions to promote pedestrian-oriented development in order to broaden residential choice. The results further imply that, due to housing-supply constraints, households often have to live in a neighborhood with a level of accessibility lower than what they prefer. Transportation and land-use planners should address this “residential dissonance” when applying residential location choice models to predict land-use growth patterns.",1361-9209,Not found
Does a carbon tax affect the feasibility of Arctic shipping?,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102257,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"The Arctic route has huge potential for shipping between Europe and Northeast Asia with significant savings in transit time and distance. However, GHG emissions from shipping would harm the environment of Arctic area. Potential Market Based Measures of GHG emission reduction (such as carbon tax) are under consideration but they may affect the economic viability of Northern Sea Route (NSR) for containerships. This paper investigates the economic viability of NSR against Suez Canal Route (SCR) under 2 proposed carbon tax schemes (fixed vs. progressive). Three different fuel oil types (Heavy Fuel Oil, Light Fuel Oil, Liquified Natural Gas) are used as main bunker fuel for the calculation of economic feasibility. Our result reveals that when there is no carbon tax on NSR nor SCR, or both routes are under a carbon tax scheme, no matter fixed or progressive, NSR is more economically viable, regardless of fuel type choice. When only NSR is under a carbon tax scheme, the viability depends on specific carbon tax scheme and fuel choice, but for the majority of containership sizes, NSR has lower unit cost. The result also suggests that for a given route, a progressive scheme in preferable than a fixed one and LNG would be an appealing fuel with lower unit cost.",1361-9209,Not found
Siting charging stations for electric vehicle adoption in shared autonomous fleets,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102231,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"The transportation sector is undergoing three revolutions: shared mobility, autonomous driving, and electrification. When planning the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, it is critical to consider the potential interactions and synergies among these three emerging systems. This study proposes a framework to optimize charging infrastructure development for increasing electric vehicle (EV) adoption in systems with different levels of autonomous vehicle adoption and ride sharing participation. The proposed model also accounts for the pre-existing charging infrastructure, vehicle queuing at the charging stations, and the trade-offs between building new charging stations and expanding existing ones with more charging ports. Using New York City (NYC) taxis as a case study, we evaluated the optimum charging station configurations for three EV adoption pathways. The pathways include EV adoption in a 1) traditional fleet (non-autonomous vehicles without ride sharing), 2) future fleet (fully autonomous vehicles with ride sharing), and 3) switch-over from traditional to future fleet. Our results show that, EV adoption in a traditional fleet requires charging infrastructure with fewer stations that each has more charging ports, compared to the future fleet which benefits from having more scattered charging stations. Charging will only reduce the service level by 2% for a future fleet with 100% EV adoption. EV adoption can reduce CO2 emissions of NYC taxis by up to 861 Tones/day for the future fleet and 1100 Tones/day for the traditional fleet.",1361-9209,Not found
Sustainability assessment of inland transportation in China: A triple bottom line-based network DEA approach,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102258,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"The transport sector accounts for nearly one third of the world’s total energy use, while inland transport alone is responsible for half of the global petroleum consumption. The expansion of motorization in newly industrialized economies necessitates setting realistic targets. To support decision-makers in better assessment of transport sustainability performance, we introduce a systematic triple bottom line-based approach to evaluate inland transport, considering social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. The proposed network data envelopment analysis (DEA) measure organizes the three components of the system into a parallel structure, allocates shared input across subsystems, and incorporates undesirable output. The empirical application determines the efficiency of regional inland transportation systems in China from 2006 to 2015. The results indicate a rise in overall transport efficiency between China’s 11th and 12th five-year development plan periods and link the economic growth with a decrease in environmental transport efficiency in the Central and Western zones and with a decline in social efficiency in the Eastern zone. Since 2012, the social sustainability remains the weakest component of inland transport, which requires special attention by policy-makers to support vulnerable groups of transport users. This study provides further insight into the investigated measures and proposes recommendations for the improvement of inland transport in China.",1361-9209,Not found
Sustainable cold supply chain management under demand uncertainty and carbon tax regulation,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102245,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Increasing awareness of sustainability in supply chain management has prompted organizations and individuals to consider environmental impacts when managing supply chains. The issues concerning environmental impacts are significant in cold supply chains due to substantial carbon emissions from storage and distribution of temperature-sensitive product. This paper investigates the impact of carbon emissions arising from storage and transportation in the cold supply chain in the presence of carbon tax regulation, and under uncertain demand. A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed to determine optimal replenishment policies and transportation schedules to minimize both operational and emissions costs. A matheuristic algorithm based on the Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm and a mixed integer programming is developed to solve the problem in realistic sizes. The performance and robustness of the matheuristic algorithm are analyzed using test instances in various sizes. A real-world case study in Queensland, Australia is used to demonstrate the application of the model. The results highlight that higher emissions price does not always contribute to the efficiency of the cold supply chain system. Furthermore, the analyses indicate that using heterogeneous fleet including light duty and medium duty vehicles can lead to further cost saving and emissions reduction.",1361-9209,Not found
Factors and scenario analysis of transport carbon dioxide emissions in rapidly-developing cities,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102252,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"To identify key factors of transport CO2 emissions and determine effective policies for emission reductions in fast-growing cities, this study establishes transport CO2 emission models, quantifying the influences of polycentricity and satellite cities and re-examining the effects of per capita GDP and metro service. Based on the model results, we forecast future residents’ urban transport CO2 emissions under several scenarios of different urban and transport policies and new energy technologies. We find nonlinear quadratic growth relationship between commuting CO2 emissions and per capita GDP, and the elasticities of household and individual commuting CO2 emission to per capita GDP are 1.90% and 1.45%, respectively. Developing job-housing balanced satellite cities and self-contained polycentric city can greatly decrease emissions from high emitters and can contribute to about 51–82% of the emission reductions by 2050 compared with the scenario of business as usual (BAU). Promotion of electric vehicles, electric public buses, metros, and improvement of traditional energy efficiency contributes to about 48–57% of the emission reductions by 2050 compared with the BAU. When these policies and technologies are combined, about 90% of the emissions could be reduced by 2050 compared with the BAU, and the emissions will be about 1.2–4.9 times of the present. The findings suggest that fostering polycentric urban form and job-housing balanced satellite cities is the key step for future transport CO2 emission reductions.

An innovative model to estimate the accessibility of a destination by public transport,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102256,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Accessibility is a valuable indicator for assessing the effectiveness of a transport network. Nevertheless, its analysis can lead to very heterogeneous results depending on the method adopted, thus still struggling to be considered by policy makers and in planning processes. This article contributes to the development of an accessibility analysis as a planning tool, by proposing an alternative model to estimate the relative accessibility of a destination by public transport (PT). Indeed, PT is a mobility paradigm that has been supported to reduce the negative externalities produced by private transport, especially in environmentally fragile contexts. The model includes a set of eleven factors affecting public transport operation which refer to four macro topics: connectivity, multimodality, tariff/ticketing, and info-mobility. They are integrated into a Public Transport Accessibility index which analyses a series of nodes along a route and detects the progressive variation of accessibility. Eventual shifts are highlighted, including information about the factors feeding them. The model is tested for the Lana-Zurich (IT-CH) connection, showing how the most relevant issues are caused by difficulties in the transnational and transregional integration of the services. Through this process, the model aims at backing policy makers in the detection and understanding of public transport barriers and related causes.",1361-9209,Not found
Powertrain technologies and their impact on greenhouse gas emissions in key car markets,10.1016/j.trd.2019.102214,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"The role alternative car technologies may play in effectively tackling the problem of climate change is still highly uncertain. This paper aims at investigating possible impacts of car powertrain technologies on future energy demand and its corresponding greenhouse gas emissions until 2030. A system dynamics model covering nine car technologies in China, France, Germany, India, Japan and the United States was applied, with a focus on electric cars. Four main scenarios are constructed and sensitivity analysis undertaken. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars in the six countries are simulated to reach up to 2.6 gigatonnes in 2030 (a 13–32% increase between 2020 and 2030, depending on the scenario). The main conclusion from model-based policy analysis is that electric cars may have a positive contribution to emissions mitigation in the passenger road transport system. However, greenhouse gas emissions from cars arising from the combined effect of car manufacturing and scrappage and electricity generation processes are expected to grow more dramatically. As a result, actions that support both low-emission (re-)manufacturing and clean electricity generation are needed. These results complement accurate but static life cycle assessments and open the discussion for dynamic model assumptions.",1361-9209,Not found
Young people and the private car: A love-hate relationship,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102235,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Urban mobility is one of the main concerns of the public authorities in developed countries. In France, household travel surveys are conducted every ten years in major cities to gather weekday mobility data. They enable decision-makers to better understand travel patterns, their change and their determinants, in order to adapt transport infrastructures to the population′s needs. While the automobile has allowed the level of mobility to increase since 1950, an unexpected finding has emerged from recent surveys in most developed countries, namely that there has been a marked decline in car use. Analyses show that this trend is mainly because young adults (18–34 years old) are less likely to acquire a driver′s license. This paper tries to better understand the decrease in the rate of driver′s license holding among young adults in the Lyon conurbation and to quantify the impact of the main explanatory factors in a temporal perspective. It also aims to analyze the consequences of this trend on private car use as a driver for daily trips. It quantifies the influence of economic, socio-demographic and spatial factors on driver ′ s license holding and car use by considering the responses to the last three household travels surveys conducted in the Lyon conurbation area (1995, 2006 and 2015).

Evaluating the environmental impacts of online shopping: A behavioral and transportation approach,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102223,80,2020-03-01,2020,3,"Various fields and commercial sectors have witnessed a transformation with the advent of the internet. In the last decade, the retail sector in particular has witnessed the massive growth of e-commerce. This has also significantly altered our shopping experiences, influencing a range of decisions, from where, how, and how much to shop. With the consistent growth of e-commerce transactions, more trucks than ever before are entering cities today, bringing with them the negative externalities of increased congestion and pollution. This study first unravels underlying shopping behaviors–both in-store and online–using the 2016 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data. The authors also develop an econometric behavioral model to understand the factors that affect shopping decisions. At a macro level, the disaggregate individual shopping behaviors are studied by implementing the model to synthetic populations to estimate potential vehicle miles traveled and environmental emissions in two metropolitan areas, Dallas and San Francisco (SF).

Exploring the influence of built environment on Uber demand,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102296,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Ride-sourcing services have made significant changes to the transportation system, essentially creating a new mode of transport, arguably with its own relative utility compared to the other standard modes. As ride-sourcing services have become more popular each year and their markets have grown, so have the publications related to the emergence of these services. One question that has not been addressed yet is how the built environment, the so-called D variables (i.e., density, diversity, design, distance to transit, and destination accessibility), affect demand for ride-sourcing services. By having unique access to Uber trip data in 24 diverse U.S. regions, we provide a robust data-driven understanding of how ride-sourcing demand is affected by the built environment, after controlling for socioeconomic factors. Our results show that Uber demand is positively correlated with total population and employment, activity density, land use mix or entropy, and transit stop density of a census block group. In contrast, Uber demand is negatively correlated with intersection density and destination accessibility (both by auto and transit) variables. This result might be attributed to the relative advantages of other modes – driving, taking transit, walking, or biking – in areas with denser street networks and better regional job access. The findings of this paper have important implications for policy, planning, and travel demand modeling, where decision-makers seek solutions to shape the built environment in order to reduce automobile dependence and promote walking, biking, and transit use.",1361-9209,Not found
Personal exposures to PM during short distance highway travel in India,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102315,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Traffic is the largest contributor (37%) to urban air pollution in India.

We carried out a study on a National Highway (NH) in India to measure personal exposure to Particulate Matter (PM) in five travel modes. PM2.5 concentrations showed the following trend: Bus > Car FA (fresh air mode of air condition) > Bus AC > Car > Car RC (re-circulation mode of air condition). Highest and lowest concentrations of PM10 were observed in Bus (134 ± 47 µg m−3) and Car RC (20 ± 5 µg m−3), respectively. The exposures were highest at the rear seats during the Bus AC journeys. In Car FA, the contribution of PM1 to total concentrations was dominant (61%). Travel modes explained highest variabilities in PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 concentrations. In all travel modes, the highest particle counts were observed for PM0.3–0.5. PM>0.5–5.0 counts during Bus journeys were comparatively higher than remaining modes. Deposition doses of passengers were as high as 3.22 µg of PM10 (in Bus), 0.66 µg of PM2.5 (in Bus) and 0.06 µg of PM1 (in Bus AC) during the ~1 h journey.

Developing metro-based accessibility: Three aspects of China's Rail+Property practice,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102288,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Populous Chinese cities have invested heavily in metro systems and planned proactively for transit-oriented development. Rail plus property (R+P) programs, where metro corporations engage in, and even orchestrate real estate development in or around rail station areas, have been recurrently reported among these cities. However, careful assessment of these programs is still rare in the existing literature. Built upon multiple R+P programs led by Shenzhen Metro Cooperation and/or Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway Cooperation, this article fathoms the rationale for R+P programs in Mainland China, the obstacles for oversea private investors’ participation and the balance between profit making and social goods supply. It finds that R+P programs serve as alternative funding sources for expensive metro projects. It decreases municipal governments’ cash flow contribution to those projects, which is mandated by the central government. In addition, local business environment for R+P projects has disadvantaged private sector participation, especially those private investors from overseas. Furthermore, public subsidy to local metro corporations is likely to persist as R+P programs have not been designed for economic value maximization; rather, they are in place because (1) they reduce the cash flow burden of the municipal government; (2) they are tasked by the municipal government to produce a considerable number of affordable public housing.",1361-9209,Not found
Economic and ecological optimization of electric bus charging considering variable electricity prices and CO<inf>2eq</inf> intensities,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102293,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"In many cities, diesel buses are being replaced by electric buses with the aim of reducing local emissions and thus improving air quality. The protection of the environment and the health of the population is the highest priority of our society. For the transport companies that operate these buses, not only ecological issues but also economic issues are of great importance. Due to the high purchase costs of electric buses compared to conventional buses, operators are forced to use electric vehicles in a targeted manner in order to ensure amortization over the service life of the vehicles. A compromise between ecology and economy must be found in order to both protect the environment and ensure economical operation of the buses. In this study, we present a new methodology for optimizing the vehicles’ charging time as a function of the parameters CO2eq emissions and electricity costs. Based on recorded driving profiles in daily bus operation, the energy demands of conventional and electric buses are calculated for the passenger transportation in the city of Aachen in 2017. Different charging scenarios are defined to analyze the influence of the temporal variability of CO2eq intensity and electricity price on the environmental impact and economy of the bus. For every individual day of a year, charging periods with the lowest and highest costs and emissions are identified and recommendations for daily bus operation are made. To enable both the ecological and economical operation of the bus, the parameters of electricity price and CO2 are weighted differently, and several charging periods are proposed, taking into account the priorities previously set. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the influence of selected parameters and to derive recommendations for improving the ecological and economic balance of the battery-powered electric vehicle. In all scenarios, the optimization of the charging period results in energy cost savings of a maximum of 13.6% compared to charging at a fixed electricity price. The savings potential of CO2eq emissions is similar, at 14.9%. From an economic point of view, charging between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. results in the lowest energy costs on average. The CO2eq intensity is also low in this period, but midday charging leads to the largest savings in CO2eq emissions. From a life cycle perspective, the electric bus is not economically competitive with the conventional bus. However, from an ecological point of view, the electric bus saves on average 37.5% CO2eq emissions over its service life compared to the diesel bus. The reduction potential is maximized if the electric vehicle exclusively consumes electricity from solar and wind power.",1361-9209,Not found
Non-exhaust particle emissions under various driving conditions: Implications for sustainable mobility,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102290,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Non-exhaust particle (NEP) emissions from road traffic contribute significantly to Particulate Matter (PM) pollution in urban areas. The primary objective herein is to develop the knowledge required to move toward more sustainable mobility. NEP emissions are studied by means of complementary experiments on chassis dynamometers, on test tracks and at the roadside. Laboratory tests demonstrate that brake wear particles (BWP) emissions can change with braking force and frequency. A brake pad temperature threshold exists, above which the rate of ultrafine particle emissions is quite high. Below this threshold, the BWP emissions are dominant in the accumulation and coarse modes. Test track measurements have demonstrated that tire-road contact particle (TRCP) emissions considerably modify the atmospheric PM background especially for the supermicron fraction. Their number size distribution highlighted an ultrafine and accumulation modes centered at about 40 nm and 200 nm, respectively. The TRCP level increases with vehicle speed and during the acceleration and deceleration phases. Roadside measurements in the urban environment confirm the presence of NEP in significant proportions, in both the accumulation and coarse modes. The chemical composition of NEP differs depending on the size mode: BWP mainly stem from the degradation of brake pad lining materials, while TRCP are a mixture of tire tread wear and re-suspended dust. The presence of Fe-rich particles nevertheless serves as a good indicator of the NEP contribution to PM at the roadside. Lastly, in considering the parameters influencing NEP emissions, a series of recommendations are offered in order to achieve a more sustainable mobility.",1361-9209,Not found
The role of charging and refuelling infrastructure in supporting zero-emission vehicle sales,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102275,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Widespread uptake of battery electric, plug-in hybrid, and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (collectively zero-emissions vehicles or ZEVs) could help many regions achieve deep greenhouse gas mitigation goals. Using the case of Canada, this study investigates the extent to which increasing ZEV charging and refuelling availability may boost ZEV sales relative to other ZEV-supportive policies. We adapt a version of the Respondent-based Preferences and Constraints (REPAC) model using 2017 survey data from 1884 Canadian new vehicle-buyers to simulate the sales impacts of increasing electric vehicle charging access at home, work, public destinations, and on highways, as well as increasing hydrogen refuelling station access. REPAC is built from a stated preference choice model and represents constraints in supply and consumer awareness, as well as dynamics in ZEV policy out to 2030. Results suggest that new ZEV market share from 2020 to 2030 does not substantially benefit from increased infrastructure. Even when electric charging and hydrogen refuelling access are simulated to reach “universally” available levels by 2030, ZEV sales do not rise by more than 1.5 percentage points above the baseline trajectory. On the other hand, REPAC simulates ZEV market share rising as high as 30% by 2030 with strong ZEV-supportive policies, even without the addition of charging or refuelling infrastructure. These findings stem from low consumer valuation of infrastructure found in the stated preference model. Results suggest that achieving ambitious ZEV sale targets requires a comprehensive suite of policies beyond a focus on charging and refueling infrastructure.",1361-9209,Not found

This paper focuses on the effectiveness of the ECA policy in shanghai port by adopting regression discontinuity (RD) approach. The RD design is considered as a wonderful substitution for the randomized control trial, which usually serves as a conventional and effective tool to address endogeneity. The causal effect of the ECA policy on the SO2 concentration reduction can be detected by the RD approach. According to the estimated results, there is a discontinuity around the ECA policy cutoff point, and it is indicated that the SO2 concentration in Shanghai decreased by at least 0.229 μg/m3 daily on average due to the implementation of the ECA policy. The positive role that the ECA policy plays in reducing SO2 concentration in Shanghai is well demonstrated.

A carbon footprint analysis of railway sleepers in the United Kingdom,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102285,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This paper provides an assessment of the lifecycle Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions associated with the four most common sleeper (railroad tie or cross-tie in North America) types present in the UK rail network. It estimates the embodied material, process and transport emissions linked with the lifecycle activities of construction, relay/renewal and end-of-life of these variants at low and high traffic tonnage. The analysis suggests that at low traffic loads, the softwood sleepers perform the best over the whole simulated-period. At high traffic loads, the concrete sleepers outperform all other variants in terms of lifecycle CO2e emissions, followed by hardwood, softwood and steel. Regardless of the scenario examined, the steel sleepers perform the worst due to the carbon intensive nature of their manufacturing process. This performance gap is amplified at high traffic loads, as their service life is excessively compromised. The analysis reveals that the end-of-life pathway of timber is a critical determinant of its footprint. Results suggest that the impact of disposing of these sleepers results in their footprint being magnified. Nevertheless, if a minimum of 50% follows the combustion pathway with subsequent heat recuperation, then a GHG reduction potential of between 11% and 18% of their footprint is feasible. From a whole-lifecycle cost lens, for higher tonnage routes, the choice of concrete sleepers results in considerable financial savings. If the infrastructure manager was to install sleepers with stiff under sleeper pads (USPs), it may achieve additional economic and GHG savings, with potential for increasing the latter using recycled carbon-neutral USPs.",1361-9209,Not found

New infrastructure can alter the profile of noise, emissions, and land use, which may affect the quality of life for airport-adjacent communities.

This research investigates the environmental justice methodologies and narratives reported in planning documents for nineteen airport capacity expansions planned or deployed from 2000 to 2010 in the United States. The mixed-methods approach analyzes airport operations data, spatial demographic data, and planning artifacts to determine whether the environmental justice analyses were robust. This research proposes alternative metrics, the ‘Risk of disproportionate impact’ and ‘Capacity strain’, to further contextualize the presence of protected population groups alongside capacity needs. The main finding of the study is that the planning documents did not consistently detect environmental justice impacts, nor did they consistently confer importance to those impacts when high proportions of protected populations were detected. As a result, the social costs of collective airport expansion are unclear and likely underestimated.

However, two dominant trends in the US BEV market make these studies increasingly obsolete: sales show significant increases in battery capacity and attendant range and are increasingly dominated by large luxury or high-performance vehicles. In addition, an era of new use and ownership models may mean significant changes to vehicle utilization, and the carbon intensity of electricity is expected to decrease. Thus, the question is whether these trends significantly alter our expectations of future BEV LCGHG emissions. To answer this question, three archetypal vehicle designs for the year 2025 along with scenarios for increased range and different use models are simulated in an LCGHG model: an efficiency-oriented compact vehicle; a high performance luxury sedan; and a luxury sport utility vehicle. While production emissions are less than 10% of LCGHG emissions for today’s gasoline vehicles, they account for about 40% for a BEV, and as much as two-thirds of a future BEV operated on a primarily renewable grid. Larger battery systems and low utilization do not outweigh expected reductions in emissions from electricity used for vehicle charging. These trends could be exacerbated by increasing BEV market shares for larger vehicles. However, larger battery systems could reduce per-mile emissions of BEVs in high mileage applications, like on-demand ride sharing or shared vehicle fleets, meaning that trends in use patterns may countervail those in BEV design.",1361-9209,Not found
Achieving sustainable development of supply chain by incorporating various carbon regulatory mechanisms,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102253,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Nowadays, sustainability issues have received considerable attention in supply chain management because of the governmental requirements as well as expectations of the people. This paper introduces a novel supply chain network design problem to cover three dimensions of sustainability, namely economic, environmental, and social. The advantage of the presented model stems from considering the booming development aligned with reduction in environmental impact. In this paper, to achieve the mentioned benefits and to derive a more sustainable supply chain, a novel model in the presence of the most commonly used carbon policies is proposed. This paper, addresses sustainable development through imposing proper carbon regulatory mechanisms. Main contribution of this study is to consider the effect of imposing carbon policies on environmental advantages as well as improving the regional development level in a supply chain network design problem. Moreover, the shipment consolidation decisions are utilized to reduce cost as well as environmental impact. In addition, a novel mixed uncertainty approach is proposed to capture the uncertain emission parameters. The numerical examples and a case study are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. It is concluded that, a high-growth economy with low-carbon can be made and also almost global well-being of people is ensured by applying the proposed model. Some managerial insights are provided for the enterprises of supply chains to make the most appropriate sustainable decisions. Finally, proper carbon emission policies are suggested based on the region sustainability characteristics.",1361-9209,Not found
A new generalized travel cost based connectivity metric applied to Scandinavian airports,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102280,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This article proposes a new, generalized travel cost based method to operationalize network accessibility provided by airports. The approach is novel as it integrates features of network topology with multiple quality aspects of scheduled air transport services into one metric. The method estimates generalized travel costs for the full set of feasible travel paths between an airport and all network destinations. Rooftop modeling accounts for schedule delay and isolates the most cost-efficient travel paths per O-D relation. Respecting the assumed arrival time preference of passengers and adjusting for destination importance, connectivity scores are derived. The method is then applied to explore changes in the global connectivity pattern of Scandinavian airports from 2004 to 2018. The results suggest distinct spatial differences throughout the network, but less pronounced in size than suggested by popularly applied connectivity measures. Findings also highlight the importance of the geographical location as a determinate of an airport’s connectivity.",1361-9209,Not found
"Birds using tram tracks in Poznań (Poland): Species, infrastructure use and behaviour",10.1016/j.trd.2020.102282,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Transport infrastructures, mainly roads and railways, influence many aspects of bird life. The use of trams in urban areas for mass transit has been suggested as having a lower impact on the environment. However, to date, the impact of tram tracks and the surrounding infrastructure on birds has not been directly tested. Therefore, we posed two questions during a study of tramways in Poznań (western Poland): (1) which bird species use tram tracks and their infrastructure; and (2) how does their behaviour respond to moving trams. Tram tracks were recorded as used by 11 species, with four corvids (jackdaw Corvus monedula, rook Corvus frugilegus, magpie Pica pica and hooded crow Corvus cornix) totalling 66% of records and feral pigeon Columba livia contributing a further 24%. Species showed different usage patterns of the tram infrastructure. In the case of rook during winter, significantly more birds were observed further from a tram stop. In summer, a higher density of jackdaws occurred where track surroundings were vegetated, and both hooded crows in winter and magpies in winter were more abundant where track geometry was more complex. During our field work only two dead birds on tram tracks were observed. The results of this study, and a literature survey of other transport options, suggest that tram tracks are not very dangerous for birds, and at least from this point of view, can be recommended as an environmentally friendly transport system in urban areas.",1361-9209,Not found
Aural comfort prediction method for high-speed trains under complex tunnel environments,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102284,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Aural comfort is negatively affected during a train’s passage through various tunnel environments. The objective of this study was to propose a prediction model for determining optimal operation parameter combinations to improve train occupants’ aural comfort. High-speed train model tests, combined with a mathematical transfer model, were used to obtain the interior pressure transients under varying speeds, tunnel lengths and seal indexes. Then, a middle ear finite element model was used to simulate the dynamic responses under the pressure transients, and three indicators were employed to assess the severity of aural sensations. Meanwhile, the aural discomfort were classified into four groups according to the duration. Based on the simulation results, the ordinal regression analysis method was used to reveal the effects of the considered factors on aural comfort. The results indicate that aural discomfort sensations begin when a train runs in the middle of a tunnel but are mitigated when it approaches the tunnel exit. Furthermore, aural discomfort is positively correlated with the train speed and the distance from the driver cabin of the head car but negatively correlated with the seal index and tunnel length. As a conclusion, a mathematical prediction model was established that incorporates factors including the train speed, seal index, tunnel length and car position. It can not only forecast aural sensations under certain operation parameters and tunnel environments but also be used for determining the optimal operation parameters to ensure the best aural sensations for high-speed-train occupants.",1361-9209,Not found
Dynamic Modal Accessibility Gap: Measurement and Application Using Travel Routes Data,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102272,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Accessibility is a key concept in transportation research and an important indicator of people’s quality of life. With the development of big data analytics, dynamic accessibility that captures the temporal variations of accessibility becomes an important research focus. Few prior studies focus on comparative measures of dynamic accessibility to Points of Interest (POIs) by alternative travel modes. To fill this research gap, we propose a new index called dynamic modal accessibility gap (DMAG), which draws upon available data on residents’ real travel routes using different travel modes, as well as the data on POIs. We study the DMAG in the real-travel covered area, assuming POIs are only useful if it is within someone’s real-travel covered area. We then apply this DMAG methodology to Shanghai’s central city and peripheral area. In both cases, we measure the accessibility for public and private travel modes. As an example, one-week taxi GPS and metro smart card data, and POIs data are used to generate the DMAG index for 30-minute and 60-minute trip durations for weekdays and holidays. Results show that DMAG can reflect the pattern of temporal variations. The proposed DMAG analytical framework, which can be applied at both the user and the system levels, can support urban and transportation planning, and promote social equity and livability.",1361-9209,Not found
Modeling charging infrastructure impact on the electric vehicle market in China,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102248,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"The plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) is deemed as a critical technological revolution, and the governments are imposing various vehicle policies to promote its development. Meanwhile, the market success of PEVs depends on many aspects. This study integrates one’s use of charging infrastructure at home, public place and workplace into the market dynamics analysis tool, New Energy and Oil Consumption Credits (NEOCC) model, to systematically assess the charging infrastructure (home parking ratio, public charging opportunity, and charging costs) impact on PEV ownership costs and analyze how the PEV market shares may be affected by the attributes of the charging infrastructure. Compared to the charging infrastructure, the impact of battery costs is incontrovertibly decisive on PEV market shares, the charging infrastructure is still non-negligible in the PEV market dynamics. The simulation results find that the public charging infrastructure has more effectiveness on promoting the PEV sales in the PEV emerging market than it does in the PEV mature market. However, the improvement of charging infrastructure does not necessarily lead to a larger PEV market if the charging infrastructure incentives do not coordinate well with other PEV policies. Besides, the increase of public charging opportunities has limited motivations on the growth of public PEV fleets, which are highly correlated to the number of public fast charging stations or outlets. It also finds that more home parking spaces can stimulate more sales of personal plug-in hybrid electric vehicles instead of personal battery electric vehicles.",1361-9209,Not found
Shared autonomous electric vehicle service performance: Assessing the impact of charging infrastructure,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102283,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are the next major evolution in urban mobility. This technology has attracted much interest of car manufacturers aiming at playing a role as transportation network companies (TNCs) and carsharing agencies in order to gain benefits per kilometer and per ride. It is predicted that the majority of future SAVs would most probably be electric. It is therefore important to understand how limited vehicle range and the configuration of charging infrastructure will affect the performance of shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) services. In this study, we aim to explore the impacts of charging station placement, charging types (including normal and rapid charging, and battery swapping), and vehicle battery capacities on service efficiency. We perform an agent-based simulation of SAEVs across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. The simulation process features impact assessment by considering dynamic demand responsive to the network and traffic. Research results suggest that the performance of SAEVs is strongly correlated with the charging infrastructure. Importantly, faster charging infrastructure and placement of charging locations according to minimized distances between demand hubs and charging stations result in a higher performance. Further analysis indicates the importance of dispersing charging stations across the service area and its impacts on service effectiveness. The results also underline that SAEV battery capacity has to be selected carefully such that to avoid the overlaps between demand and charging peak times. Finally, the simulation results show that the performance indicators of SAEV service are significantly improved by providing battery swapping infrastructure.",1361-9209,Not found
Development of a representative urban driving cycle construction methodology for electric vehicles: A case study in Xi'an,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102279,81,2020-04-01,2020,4,"This paper develops a systematic and practical construction methodology of a representative urban driving cycle for electric vehicles, taking Xi’an as a case study. The methodology tackles four major tasks: test route selection, vehicle operation data collection, data processing, and driving cycle construction. A qualitative and quantitative comprehensive analysis method is proposed based on a sampling survey and an analytic hierarchy process to design test routes. A hybrid method using a chase car and on-board measurement techniques is employed to collect data. For data processing, the principal component analysis algorithm is used to reduce the dimensions of motion characteristic parameters, and the K-means and support vector machine hybrid algorithm is used to classify the driving segments. The proposed driving cycle construction method is based on the Markov and Monte Carlo simulation method. In this study, relative error, performance value, and speed-acceleration probability distribution are used as decision criteria for selecting the most representative driving cycle. Finally, characteristic parameters, driving range, and energy consumption are compared under different driving cycles.",1361-9209,Not found

Given the mixed conclusions of previous studies, as well as the lack of information on reliable methods of assessment and quantifiable mechanisms, a three-year dataset for prefecture-level and above city regions in China and spatial econometric models were used to examine the relationship between regional polycentricity and CO2 concentrations. After robust testing, we confirmed that polycentric structures decrease the mean CO2 concentrations of city regions, significantly reducing CO2 concentrations in primary city centers and mildly increasing those in city subcenters. Further quantitative analyses of the mechanisms underlying these patterns revealed that the CO2-reduction effect of polycentric structures is due to the balancing of reductions in commuting duration, transference of industrial CO2 to neighboring areas, and an increase in household CO2 emissions.",1361-9209,Not found
Examining the relationship between built environment and metro ridership at station-to-station level,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102332,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Very few studies have examined the impact of built environment on urban rail transit ridership at the station-to-station (origin-destination) level. Moreover, most direct ridership models (DRMs) tend to involve simple a prior assumed linear or log-linear relationship in which the estimated parameters are assumed to hold across the entire data space of the explanatory variables. These models cannot detect any changes in the linear (or non-linear) effects across different values of the features of built environment on urban rail transit ridership, which possibly induces biased results and hides some non-negligible and detailed information. Based on these research gaps, this study develops a time-of-day origin-destination DRM that uses smart card data pertaining to the Nanjing metro system, China. It applies a gradient boosting regression trees model to provide a more refined data mining approach to investigate the non-linear associations between features of the built environment and station-to-station ridership. Data related to the built environment, station type, demographics, and travel impedance including a less used variable – detour, were collected and used in the analysis. The empirical results show that most independent variables are associated with station-to-station ridership in a discontinuous non-linear way, regardless of the time period. The built environment on the origin side has a larger effect on station-to-station ridership than the built environment on the destination side for the morning peak hours, while the opposite holds for the afternoon peak hours and night. The results also indicate that transfer times is more important variables than detour and route distance.",1361-9209,Not found

To that aim, a Euro 6 passenger car was tested under various real-world driving conditions. In order to cover the full range of conventional powertrains currently in the market, the tests were also repeated on a Euro 6 diesel passenger car. Both cars were driven in two routes, the first complying with the regulation limits and the second going beyond them. Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particle number (PN) emissions were recorded using a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS). Apart from the aggregated emission levels, in g/km, the exact emission location along the route was also assessed. Natural gas proved beneficial for CO and PN emissions, the level of which always remained below the respective legislation limits. On the other hand, under the dynamic driving conditions with gasoline, the relevant limits were exceeded. Cold start, occurring at the beginning of the urban part, and motorway driving were identified as major contributors to total emissions, especially in gasoline mode. However, the application of natural gas was associated with a penalty in NOx emissions, which were significantly increased as compared to gasoline. Local peaks within the urban part were identified in CNG mode. In any case, the diesel vehicle was by far the highest NOx emitter.",1361-9209,Not found

Encompassing all MSAs, the study adds the accessibility factor to four existing factors: density, land use mix, centeredness, and street connectivity. The study establishes multivariate regression models between urban form, commuting trips, and emissions from road traffic while controlling for socioeconomic conditions. The study shows that urban form index and five urban form factors have a statistically significant association with commuting trips, NOx and CO2 emissions from road traffic. In four MSA groups as determined by MSA population size, higher values of urban form factors (i.e., lower sprawl) are statistically associated with more walking commuters. On the other hand, higher values of urban form factors are associated with fewer commuting vehicles per household in large MSAs with the moderate effect, a lower average commuting drive time in medium and small MSAs, and more commuters using public transportation in medium and large MSAs. This study provides an urban form index covering all metropolitan areas in the continental United States by adding another urban form factor, and the findings show that urban form factors have different effects on mode choices, drive time, and emission from road traffic depending on the MSA population size.",1361-9209,Not found
Estimating transboundary economic damages from climate change and air pollution for subnational incentives for green on-road freight,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102325,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Subnational incentives to adopt zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) are critical for reducing the external economic damages posed by transportation to air quality and the climate. Few studies estimate these damages for on-road freight, especially at scales relevant for subnational policies requiring cross-border cooperation. Here, we assess the damages to US receptors from emissions of air pollutants (PM2.5, NOx, SO2, NH3), and greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) from medium and heavy duty freight trucking, and the benefits of ZEV adoption by census division in the Province of Ontario. We develop an integrated modelling framework connecting a travel demand model, a mobile emissions simulator, and a regression based marginal damages model of air pollutants and climate change. We estimate $1.9 billion (2010 USD) in annual cross-border damages, or $0.16/VKT, resulting from scaled up atmospheric emissions from a ‘typical day’ of medium and heavy duty truck traffic volume for Ontario in 2012. This implies approximately $8000 per truck per year in damages, which could inform an economic incentive for emission reduction. The provincial goal of 5% ZEV adoption would reduce GHG emissions in 2012 by 800 ktCO2e, yielding $89 Million (2010 USD) in cross-border benefits annually, with air quality co-benefits of $83/tCO2e. This result varies between −19% and 22% based on sensitivity analysis for travel and emissions models, though economic damages are likely the largest uncertainty source. Such advances in subnational scale integrated modeling of the environmental impacts of freight can offer insights into the sustainable design of clean freight policy and programs.",1361-9209,Not found
Effect of environmental awareness on electric bicycle users’ mode choices,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102320,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Travellers’ environmental awareness can affect their mode choices. The primary objective of this study is to identify the effect of electric bicycle (e-bike) users’ environmental awareness on their mode choice when the use of e-bikes is prohibited in urban areas in China. The data were collected via a questionnaire survey administered at ten locations in Nanjing, China. Using mixed multinomial logit (MMNL) models, we examined the relationship between the e-bike users’ mode choice and their environmental awareness, combined with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and trip attributes. The results show that the level of environmental awareness, gender, age, education, income, the ownership of car and conventional bike, and trip distance affect e-bike users’ choices significantly. Those with a high level of environmental awareness are more likely to choose zero-emission transport modes. A stratified analysis reveals that the effect of environmental awareness is associated with their original transport mode choice prior to their use of the e-bike. With a high level of environmental awareness, original car users tend to opt for moderate- or zero-emission modes; original bus and metro users incline to choose a zero-emission mode or their original mode; and few original cyclists and walkers favour moderate- or high-emission modes. The results of the current study provide transport authorities with insights to establish sustainable urban transportation management policies and strategies to increase the share of zero- and low-emission transport modes.",1361-9209,Not found
Sustainable mobility: Policy design and implementation in three Norwegian cities,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102330,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The paper explores barriers for designing and implementing policies for the transition to more environmentally sustainable urban mobility, and strategies for overcoming these barriers in three Norwegian cities. Empirical data has been collected by interviewing key informants and analysing relevant documents.

Cultural, legal, political, organisational, financial and knowledge-related barriers are identified. Many similar barriers are identified in the three case cities, but differences also appear. The results indicate that the size of the cities as well as the type of policy packages implemented are important factors, impacting both the type and strength of barriers. Several strategies for overcoming barriers have been implemented in the three case cities with success. The implementation of policy packages with a combination of “push” and “pull” measures is perhaps the most important strategy. In addition, using communication strategically and allowing for trials and step-by-step introduction of policy measures are success factors.

Aligning the purchase of green logistics practices between shippers and logistics service providers,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102305,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"This paper explores shippers’ (i.e. logistics buyers) and logistics service providers’ (LSPs) perceptions of green concerns under diverse contractual settings during the key phases of the logistics purchasing process: request for proposal, negotiations, contracting and execution. Accordingly, it derives recommendations that could increase the actors’ inter- and- intra-organisational alignment on green targets throughout these phases. Empirical data are obtained from eight individual cases of three shippers and five LSPs, representing the buyer/seller roles within logistics arrangements. Contrary to previous literature holding the view that setting more green demands by shippers would guarantee green outcomes, the findings show that shippers’ green demands may hinder green logistics applications due to impediments to LSPs’ asset-sharing strategies. Also, a deadlock situation is revealed in the negotiations phase, where both actors await each other to introduce additional demands/offers—calling for further regulatory intervention to release this deadlock. Moreover, this paper shows how a mismatch of interests in contractual periods between shippers and LSPs can obstruct green investments—signalling that the green criterion is not the decisive factor in shaping shippers’ outsourcing strategies. The findings also stress a lack of follow-up efforts by shippers on green measures that were specified pre-contract, attributing this to contrasting intra-organisational objectives within shippers’ firms. This paper contributes to the green logistics purchasing literature by revealing how different contractual settings play an important role in shaping shippers’/LSPs’ perceptions of green concerns during the logistics purchasing process. Further, it is one of the first studies to provide phase-specific recommendations to increase the actors’ alignment on green targets.",1361-9209,Not found

The noise map is a helpful and important tool for noise management and acoustical planning in urban areas. However, the static noise map is not sufficient for evaluating noise annoyance at different temporal periods. It is necessary to develop the dynamic noise map or the noise spatiotemporal distribution. In this study, a method about urban road traffic noise spatiotemporal distribution mapping is proposed to obtain the representative road traffic noise maps of different periods. This method relies on the proposed noise spatiotemporal distribution model with two time-dependent variables - traffic density and traffic speed, and the spatiotemporal characteristics derived from multisource data. There are three steps in the method. First, the urban road traffic noise spatiotemporal distribution model is derived from the law of sound propagation. Then, the temporal characteristics are extracted from traffic flow detecting data and E-map road segment speed data by the outlier detection analysis. Finally, the noise distributions corresponding to different periods are calculated by an efficient algorithm which can save 90% above of the computing time. Moreover, a validation experiment was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method.

As a key to understanding and changing practice I argue that storytelling plays a crucial role on different scales. In line with this, the concept of structural stories can be used to understand how specific framings of modes of transport guides everyday practices. To illustrate this, I will use the example of a concept of redesigning Copenhagen’s streets. On these streets space is redistributed so that pedestrians, cyclists and busses get more space, and more space is created for public places and city life.

The key challenge is the integration of existing institutional backgrounds and governing traditions. This paper compares how two qualitative case studies managed landscape protection while planning motorways. Specifically, we examine two internationally protected areas – one in Hungary that focuses on nature and one in Sweden the focuses on culture – to consider how these areas were assessed during the planning of the new motorways. Analysing the cases through the theoretical lens of institutional interplay, we found that the main differences between the two cases can be attributed to the different governing traditions and interpretations of landscape.",1361-9209,Not found
Cost-benefit analysis of alternative vehicles in the Philippines using immediate and distant future scenarios,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102308,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Alternative vehicle technologies promise a sustainable future by reducing carbon emissions and pollution. However, their widespread adoption tends to be slow due to high costs and uncertainties in benefits. Using a life cycle-based approach, this study calculates ownership savings and societal benefits for various alternative vehicle technologies against their baseline vehicle technology (e.g. gasoline or diesel). The assessment is performed from a developing country context – in the Philippines. Furthermore, immediate and distant future scenarios are modeled. The immediate future scenario assesses costs and benefits if the shift is to happen now, while the distant future scenario considers the effect of widespread autonomous driving and ridesharing. The results of the study echo the significant societal benefits from electric- and fuel cell-powered vehicles found in literature, but they are hindered by high ownership costs. In the immediate future, the diesel hybrid electric vehicle can potentially have both positive societal and operational costs for public transportation. For a gasoline-powered private passenger car, a simple shift to diesel, 20% biodiesel or 85% methanol can be beneficial. In the distant future, it is expected that autonomous, rideshared vehicles can potentially lure people away from driving their own vehicles, because of lower costs per passenger-kilometer while sustaining the privacy and comfort of a private car.",1361-9209,Not found
Efficiency evaluation and PM emission reallocation of China ports based on improved DEA models,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102317,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"The emission of particulate matter (PM) and other atmospheric pollutants in port operations and shipping have caused a huge negative impact on the environment. Consequently, how to evaluate the environmental efficiency of ports and put forward corresponding countermeasures on this basis is becoming a more important issue than ever before from the perspectives of the government, academia, and society. We construct three data envelopment analysis (DEA) models to evaluate the environmental efficiency of ports under the circumstances of environmental control, non-environmental control and PM emission through inter-ports cooperation. The innovation of the DEA models constructed in this paper lies in: (1) Setting environmental control parameters to uniformly manipulate the situations of environmental control and non-environmental control, etc.; (2) Allowing non-equal proportional change of input index, expected output and non-expected output index; (3) Setting preference coefficients for ports to admit favorable decisions; (4) Providing a distance formula of expected output for PM emission reallocation. Further, data from 11 major ports in China are collected to compare the expected output under different PM emission standards assuming the situation of environmental control and non-environmental control, port cooperation, and non-cooperative sewage discharge. The empirical results show that: (1) Ports in the eastern China (Shanghai, Ningbo, and Nanjing) have higher port efficiency; (2) Port cooperation can improve the overall expected output but it will lose its edge with the improvement of PM emission standards. (3) Ports follow the same trend of output loss regardless of favorable decisions.

Third, for low-income suburban commuters, transit deserts occur when they are surrounded by low-density transit infrastructure and low-frequency transit services, which makes it very difficult for them to connect to rest of the region. However, for low-income commuters residing in the city centers, transit deserts are mainly caused by the large numbers of transit-dependent people competing for limited transit supply in the areas. This research explores the relationship between transit systems and commuting demand in a major Chinese metropolitan area. The findings could help guide future transit system planning in China and beyond.",1361-9209,Not found
Risk of increasing temperature due to climate change on high-speed rail network in Spain,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102312,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"With more than 3,200 km of track, the Spanish high-speed rail network is the longest network in Europe and the second largest in the world after China. Due to its geographical location in southern Europe, the entire network is exposed to periods of elevated temperatures that can cause disturbances and severe disruptions such as rail deformation, or in the worst case, lateral track buckling. In this study, the vulnerability of the current Spanish high-speed rail network is analysed in terms of track buckling failures with a Monte Carlo simulation. Downscaled temperature projections from a range of Global Climate Models (GCMs), under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5), were forced in a buckling model and particularized for different segments of the network. With that, the proposed methodology provides the number of rail buckles expected per year by assuming current maintenance standards and procedures. The result reveals significant increase in the occurrence of buckling events for future years, mainly in the central and southern areas of mainland Spain. However, relevant variations are found in different climates and time horizon scenarios in Spain. The anticipated buckling occurrences highlight the vulnerability of the Spanish rail network in the context of global warming scenarios. Overall, the proposed methodology is designed to be applicable in large-scale railway networks to identify potential buckling sites for the purpose of understanding and predicting their behaviour.",1361-9209,Not found

As such, a comprehensive assessment of these environmental impacts is significant for future HSR construction. In this study, a hybrid input-output life cycle method is applied to evaluate multi-footprints of Beijing-Tianjin intercity HSR, namely, carbon, water, land, and material footprints. Results show that the total carbon, water, land, and material footprints of the entire Beijing-Tianjin HSR construction are 3669.0 kt CO2, 54954.7 kt fresh water, 45830.6 ha land, and 8474.2 kt original materials. In the construction stage, bridge and rail systems have the largest environmental impacts, totally contributing above 74% of the four footprints. The indirect footprints from upstream material production have the dominant effects, accounting over 89% in the four footprints. Metal smelting and rolling, transportation equipment manufacturing, and non-metallic mineral products are high-water-consuming and high-emission sectors in raw material production. Improving industrial production efficiency, optimizing line layout, optimizing production distribution and construction process management are key mitigation ways for multi-footprints.",1361-9209,Not found
Carbon dioxide emissions from port container distribution: Spatial characteristics and driving factors,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102318,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Port carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in China have become an ever-increasing public concern due to their significant impacts on human health and the environment. However, existing studies focus mainly on CO2 emissions from vessels calling at the ports and cargo handling within the ports, paying little attention to the inland distribution networks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an easily implemented method for calculating CO2 emissions from port container distribution (PCD) and investigates their spatial characteristics and driving factors. By analyzing 30 container ports in China, the main findings are as follows. First, road transportation is the major contributor of CO2 emissions from PCD due to the lack of rail and inland water transportation. Second, PCD carbon emissions exhibit significant local spatial clustering. That is, ports with similar geographical locations tend to present a similar pattern of PCD carbon emissions. Third, as suggested by the spatial Durbin model, PCD carbon emissions are negatively determined by local gross domestic product, number of port berths, but are positively determined by local tertiary industry value and highway freight volume, and waterway freight volume in both local and neighboring ports. These results provide empirical insights into cross-port collaboration in reducing PCD carbon emissions.",1361-9209,Not found
Going fast or going green?

We find that lowering the speed limit from 80 to 60 km/h reduces travel speed by 5.8 km/h. However, we find no evidence of reduced air pollution as measured next to the treated roads. Our estimates suggest an annual time loss of the speed limit reductions of 66 USD per affected vehicle. Our findings imply that policy makers need to consider other actions than speed limit reductions to improve local air quality.",1361-9209,Not found
Quantifying environmental and financial benefits of using porters and cycle couriers for last-mile parcel delivery,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102311,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Parcel carriers face increasingly difficult operating conditions in busy metropolitan areas due to growing consumer demand for ever faster delivery services and having to cope with traffic congestion and city authority measures that may restrict or penalise access for certain types of vehicle. This paper evaluates the potential environmental and financial benefits of switching from traditional van-based deliveries to an alternative operating model, where porters or cycle couriers undertake deliveries supported by a substantially reduced van fleet. Results using a specially-developed algorithm to model operations of a real carrier in an area of central London, UK, suggested that the carrier could reduce CO2 emissions by 45%, NOx emissions by 33%, driving distance by 78% and curbside parking time by 45%. Overall cost savings to the carrier were estimated to be in the range 34–39%. Scaling up the modelled emissions savings to London’s Central Activities Zone, an area of approximately 30 km2 and with current total annual parcel delivery distance of around 15 million km, could see annual emissions savings in the region of 2 million kg CO2 and 1633 kg NOx if all carriers utilised porters or cycle couriers. The key operating challenges identified were related to sorting and consolidating items by weight and volume, parcel handover arrangements and how to deal with express items and failed deliveries.",1361-9209,Not found
"Driving cycles that reproduce driving patterns, energy consumptions and tailpipe emissions",10.1016/j.trd.2020.102294,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"This study presents the Energy Based Micro-trip (EBMT) method, which is a new method to construct driving cycles that represent local driving patterns and reproduce the real energy consumption and tailpipe emissions from vehicles in a given region. It uses data of specific energy consumption, speed, and percentage of idling time as criteria of acceptable representativeness. To study the performance of the EBMT, we used a database of speed, fuel consumption, and tailpipe emissions (CO2, CO, and NOx), which was obtained monitoring at 1 Hz, the operation of 15 heavy-duty vehicles when they operated within different traffic conditions, during eight months. The speed vs. time data contained in this database defined the local driving pattern, which was described by 19 characteristic parameters (CPs). Using this database, we ran the EBMT and described the resulting driving cycle by 19 characteristics parameters (CPs*). The relative differences between CPs and CPs* quantified how close the obtained driving cycle represented the driving pattern. To observe tendencies of our results, we repeated the process 1000 times and reported the average relative difference (ARD) and the interquartile range (IQR) of those differences for each CP.. We repeated the process for the case of a traditional Micro-trip method and compared to previous results. The driving cycles constructed by the EBMT method showed the lowest values of ARDs and IQRs, meaning that it produces driving cycles with the highest representativeness of the driving patterns, and the best reproduction of energy consumption, and tailpipe emissions.",1361-9209,Not found

This limit is the latest policy in the efforts to reduce sulphur emissions from shipping, following the designation of emission control areas (ECAs) and other regional regulations. In this paper, a literature review is conducted of academic studies that have dealt with issues relating to the reduction of maritime sulphur emissions. Various recurring research themes are identified, spanning the areas of operations research, maritime economics and transport policy. The effects and implications of available compliance options are then analyzed from the perspectives of ship operators, shippers and consumers. Using lessons learned from the enforcement of ECA regulations, this is followed by an appraisal of various potential issues related to the enforcement of these new global regulations. It is found that a homogeneous enforcement regime is required to ensure a level playing field amongst ship operators and that the global sulphur cap may lead to serious market distortion, due to the potential short term rise of fuel prices. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for future research on sulphur emissions from shipping in the aftermath of the global cap and, looking forward, to its relationship to the IMO strategy on the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) shipping emissions.",1361-9209,Not found
Assessing potential likelihood and impacts of landslides on transportation network vulnerability,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102304,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"As one of the devastating natural disasters, landslide may induce significant losses of properties and lives area-wide, and generate dramatic damages to transportation network infrastructure. Accessing the impacts of landslide-induced disruptions to roadway infrastructure can be extremely difficult due to the complexity of involved impact factors and uncertainties of vulnerability related events. In this study, a data-driven approach is developed to assess landslide-induced transportation roadway network vulnerability and accessibility. The vulnerability analysis is conducted by integrating a series of static and dynamic factors to reflect the landslide likelihood and the consequences of network accessibility disruptions. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model was developed to assess and map the landslide likelihood. A generic vulnerability index (VI) was calculated for each roadway link in the network to identify critical links. Spatial distributions of landslide likelihood, consequences of network disruptions, and network vulnerability degrees were fused and analyzed. The roadway network on Oahu Island in Hawaii is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with all the geo-coded information for its network vulnerability analysis induced by area-wide landslides. Specifically, the study area was classified into five categories of landslide likelihood: very high, high, moderate, low, and stable. About 34% of the study area was assigned as the high or very high categories. The results of network vulnerability analyses highlighted the importance of three highway segments tunnel through the Ko‘olau Range from leeward to windward, connecting Honolulu to the windward coast including the Pali highway segment, Likelike highway segment, and Interstate H-3 highway segment.

Will autonomous vehicles change residential location and vehicle ownership? Glimpses from Georgia,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102291,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Many studies have begun investigating possible transportation landscapes in the autonomous vehicle (AV) era, but empirical results on longer-term decisions are limited. We address this gap using data collected from a survey designed and implemented for Georgia residents in 2017–2018. Focusing on a hypothetical all-AV future, this section of the survey included questions regarding advantages/disadvantages of AVs, short-term mode choice impacts, medium-term impacts on activity patterns, and long-term behavioral changes – specifically, whether/how AVs will influence individuals to change residential location and the number of cars in the household. We hypothesize that AVs could act in concert with attitudinal preferences to stimulate changes in these long-term decisions, and that some medium-term activity changes triggered by AVs could motivate people to relocate their residence or shed household vehicles. We applied exploratory factor analysis to measure the perceived likelihood that AVs would prompt various medium-term changes. We then included some of those measures, among other variables, in a cross-nested logit (CNL) model of the choice of the residential location/vehicle ownership bundle. Although more than half of respondents expected “no change” in their bundle, we found that younger, lower income, pro-suburban, and pro-non-car-mode individuals were more likely to anticipate changing their selections. In addition, some expected medium-term impacts of AVs influenced changes in these longer-term choices. We further applied the CNL model to two population segments (Atlanta and non-Atlanta-region residents). We found notable improvement in goodness of fit and different effects of factors across segments, signifying the existence of geography-related taste heterogeneity.",1361-9209,Not found
User satisfaction with battery electric vehicles in South Korea,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102306,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have been promoted by the government over the last several years, driven by public concern over pollutant emissions from internal combustion engines. However, the conditions related to driving BEVs are not yet satisfactory for many BEV users, as evident from sluggish market growth compared with general market forecasts. Thus, a fundamental aspect of diagnosing the current conditions of BEV operation is to evaluate BEV user satisfaction. This study establishes hypothetical links between potential factors and BEV user satisfaction, and between BEV use satisfaction and intention to repurchase and recommend. The hypothetical links are specified using a partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) and estimated based on a survey of actual BEV owners (N=160) who had driven BEVs for at least six months. The outcomes of PLS-SEM suggest that seven relations out of nine hypothetical links were statistically significant. In particular, it is noticeable that the intention for cost-saving during operation is a key factor for BEV user satisfaction and that user satisfaction with range and charging has a positive effect on the overall satisfaction of BEV users. Furthermore, those who are satisfied with BEVs have the intention to repurchase and recommend BEVs to others. Because this study was conducted based on actual experience of BEV users, the findings could enhance understanding of the BEV driving environment and, thus, pave the way to provision of better service for BEV users.",1361-9209,Not found

"Effects of income inequality on evacuation, reentry and segregation after disasters",10.1016/j.trd.2020.102260,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Large-scale disasters often trigger mass evacuation due to significant damages to urban systems. Understanding the evacuation and reentry (return) process of affected individuals is crucial for disaster management. Moreover, measuring the heterogeneity in the individuals' post-disaster behavior with respect to their socio-economic characteristics is essential for policy making. Recent studies have used large-scale location datasets collected from mobile devices to analyze post-disaster mobility patterns. Despite the availability of such data and the societal importance of the problem, no studies have focused on how income inequality affects the equity in post-disaster mobility. To overcome these research gaps, we overlay mobility data with income information from census to quantify the effects of income inequality on evacuation and reentry behavior after disasters, and the resulting spatial income segregation. Spatio-temporal analysis using location data of more than 1.7 million mobile phone users from Florida affected by Hurricane Irma reveal significant effects of income inequality on evacuation behavior. Evacuees with higher income were more likely to evacuate from affected areas and reach safer locations with less damage on housing and infrastructure. These differences were common among evacuees from both inside and outside mandatory evacuation zones. As a result of such effects of inequality, significant spatial income segregation was observed in the affected areas. Insights on the effects of income inequality on post-disaster mobility and spatial segregation could contribute to policies that better address social equity in pre-disaster preparation and post-disaster relief.",1361-9209,Not found

These responsibilities include operations under routine conditions and during incidents and events that result from various natural and human-caused hazards. During unexpected events, disruptions and reductions in service result in requiring the reallocation and reassignment of personnel, modal, and economic resources. To better prevent and respond to the effects of service disruptions, the concept of resilience has emerged as an important framework, within which, DOTs across the United States are using to plan for the occurrence of threats. In this paper, the key findings of recent reviews of literature and practice related to resilience among state DOTs in the United States are summarized.

Forecasting the impacts of climate change on inland waterways,10.1016/j.trd.2019.10.012,82,2020-05-01,2020,5,"Inland waterways are vulnerable to climate change as river navigation depends on water levels. Droughts can severely disrupt inland navigation services by reducing water levels either to completely non-navigable ones or to levels that oblige operators to reduce vessel load. We analyse the impacts of droughts induced by climate change using projections of river discharge data provided by eleven different climate model runs. We consider location specific characteristics by focusing the analysis on four specific locations of the Rhine and the Danube where a substantial part of the total freight activity in the European Union (EU) takes place. For the majority of the cases and scenarios considered, a decrease of the number of low water level days is projected, leading to fewer drought related disruptions in the operation of the inland waterway transport system. Although the uncertainties from the climate projections should not be neglected, the navigation sector could benefit from global warming which means that European inland waterways might be one of the few sectors where climate change can have negligible, or even positive, impact. The average economic benefit, for the cases considered, from the decrease of low water levels by the end of the century is projected to be almost €8million annually.",1361-9209,Not found
Hydrogen refueling station networks for heavy-duty vehicles in future power systems,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102358,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"A potential solution to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the transport sector is to use alternatively fueled vehicles (AFV). Heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) emit a large share of GHG emissions in the transport sector and are therefore the subject of growing attention from global regulators. Fuel cell and green hydrogen technologies are a promising option to decarbonize HDVs, as their fast refueling and long vehicle ranges are consistent with current logistic operational requirements. Moreover, the application of green hydrogen in transport could enable more effective integration of renewable energies (RE) across different energy sectors. This paper explores the interplay between HDV Hydrogen Refueling Stations (HRS) that produce hydrogen locally and the power system by combining an infrastructure location planning model and an electricity system optimization model that takes grid expansion options into account. Two scenarios – one sizing refueling stations to support the power system and one sizing them independently of it – are assessed regarding their impacts on the total annual electricity system costs, regional RE integration and the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The impacts are calculated based on locational marginal pricing for 2050. Depending on the integration scenario, we find average LCOH of between 4.83 euro/kg and 5.36 euro/kg, for which nodal electricity prices are the main determining factor as well as a strong difference in LCOH between north and south Germany. Adding HDV-HRS incurs power transmission expansion as well as higher power supply costs as the total power demand increases. From a system perspective, investing in HDV-HRS in symbiosis with the power system rather than independently promises cost savings of around seven billion euros per annum. We therefore conclude that the co-optimization of multiple energy sectors is important for investment planning and has the potential to exploit synergies.",1361-9209,Not found
Modelling of the pavement acoustic longevity in Hong Kong through machine learning techniques,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102366,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Traffic noise emission has long been a pervasive environmental and ecological problem, especially in the metropolitan cities with large-scale traffic network and high population density. Low noise road surface (LNRS) has been actively developed and applied as an effective measure to maintain the quieter environment of mobility service system. However, when LNRS is applied for noise abatement, the relationship between the acoustic performance and degradation of pavement has not been fully understood yet. To this end, this study aims to model the acoustic longevity of asphalt pavement as a function of the thickness, binder content, maximum aggregate size, and air void content of the pavement surface, as well as vehicle speed based on the long-term tyre-road noise data collected from 270 asphalt pavement sections in Hong Kong. Two machine learning techniques, namely artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM), were employed and compared. It was found that both ANN and SVM could successfully model the pavement acoustic performance with acceptable model performance metrics. A case study showed that the ANN model was more aligned with the aging mechanisms of porous road surface, but the SVM model showed better training performance. The predicted acoustic deterioration rates of the porous surface case varied from −0.1 to 0.28 dB(A)/month rather than keeping a constant linear increasing trend, depending on pavement ageing periods and vehicle speed levels. The two-dimension sensitivity analysis (2D-SA) revealed the relative importance of pavement age and vehicle speed in controlling the acoustic performance.",1361-9209,Not found

Reduced environmental impact of marine transport through speed reduction and wind assisted propulsion,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102380,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"To achieve IMO’s goal of a 50% reduction of GHG emission by 2050 (compared to the 2008 levels), shipping must not only work towards an optimization of each ship and its components but aim for an optimization of the complete marine transport system, including fleet planning, harbour logistics, route planning, speed profiles, weather routing and ship design. ShipCLEAN, a newly developed model, introduces a coupling of a marine transport economics model to a sophisticated ship energy systems model – it provides a leap towards a holistic optimization of marine transport systems. This paper presents how the model is applied to propose a reduction in fuel consumption and environmental impact by speed reduction of a container ship on a Pacific Ocean trade and the implementation of wind assisted propulsion on a MR Tanker on a North Atlantic trade. The main conclusions show that an increase of the fuel price, for example by applying a bunker levy, will lead to considerable, economically motivated speed reductions in liner traffic. The case study sowed possible yearly fuel savings of almost 21 300 t if the fuel price would be increased from 300 to 1000 USD/t. Accordingly, higher fuel prices can motivate the installation of wind assisted propulsion, which potentially saves up to 500 t of fuel per year for the investigated MR Tanker on a transatlantic route.",1361-9209,Not found
Measuring the performance of airport resilience to severe weather events,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102362,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"The increased severe weather events in recent years as a result of global climate change has created a substantial challenge for aviation system operation. Although transportation engineers and planners have attempted to improve system resilience through the adaptation of new technologies and the implementation of various strategies to achieve effective risk management, it remains unclear how resilience performance (measured by the speed of recovery) of airports varies in different severe weather events and what factors may explain such variations. This paper addresses these fundamental questions using the aviation system in China as an example. A resilience metric, which reflects the speed of recovery (bounce back) from a shock, was developed to measure the performance of airport resilience under various severe weather conditions. In addition, an empirical econometric analysis was conducted based on a dataset that includes both detailed aviation performance and weather conditions for the period of October 2016 – September 2017. The research findings show that airport resilience to severe weather events does vary substantially based on factors, such as weather conditions, airport capacity, and the level of modal substitution. In particular, the recovery time of air services in central and south China tends to be relatively longer in thunderstorms than other weather conditions. The study also confirms that modal substitution is a very effective resilience tactic of the transportation system as the recovery speed of air service was found to be faster by 22.9% if an alternative mode, such as high-speed rail (HSR) service was also available in the city.",1361-9209,Not found

Due to the higher content of alkylated PAHs in MDO compared to HFO, the concentration of PAHs increased during operation on MDO. The particulate PAHs classified as carcinogens, were similar to or lower in the MDO campaign. Chemical analysis of PM2.5 revealed that the particles consisted mainly of organic carbon and sulfate, although the fraction of metals was quite large in particles from the engine room. Principal Component Analysis of all measured parameters showed a clear difference between HFO and MDO fuel on the indoor environmental quality on-board the ship. This empirical study poses a first example on how environmental policy-making impacts not only the primary target at a global level, but also brings unexpected localized benefits at workplace level. The study emphasizes the need of further investigations on the impact of new marine fuels and technologies on the indoor air environments on board.",1361-9209,Not found
Impact of government incentives on the market penetration of electric vehicles in Australia,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102353,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Incentives to buy and use electric vehicles (EVs) may influence individuals’ decisions to do so. To examine these impacts, a latent class discrete choice model is developed to analyse consumer preferences related to EV attributes and related government incentives. Data was collected from a stated preference survey of 1,076 residents of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. According to the results, the proposed latent constructs classify respondents into five segments. The segments are then used to distinguish respondent behaviours regarding EV attributes and related government incentives. The results show that rebate on the upfront cost of an EV is the most preferred one-off financial incentive, because EVs are expected to be expensive, especially in Australia which has a very small EV market at present. Furthermore, rebates on energy bills and parking fees are also well-received, as these things are expensive in Sydney, Australia. Thus, operational incentives for discounts on energy bills and parking fees may facilitate the success of EVs in NSW.",1361-9209,Not found
Multi-criteria analysis of transport infrastructure projects,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102351,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Planning, construction and operation of transport infrastructure are associated with a multitude of adverse effects on the environment. The Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) are important legal instruments of the European Union's environmental policy that allows for identifying, predicting, preventing, and mitigating and or compensating for these adverse effects. As part of the environmental impact assessment, variants of planned activities and investment projects are considered in order to select the option, which is the most favourable from the environmental point of view. The primary goal of this work is to examine the possibility of using multi-criteria methods in order to select the route variant most favourable for the environment. In the first stage, a review of global literature from 2010 to 2019 was conducted on the subject of MCDM/MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Making/Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) methods used in transportation. Based on the review, it was proven that the most popular methods used to solve multi-criteria decision problems in the field of transport are respectively: AHP with modifications, TOPSIS, DEMATEL, as well as methods encompassed in the so-called European trend, i.e. PROMETHEE and ELECTRE. Four selected methods were used in the empirical part of this work.

Integrated planning of static and dynamic charging infrastructure for electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102331,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"This paper investigates the optimal deployment of static and dynamic charging infrastructure considering the interdependency between transportation and power networks. Static infrastructure means plug-in charging stations, while the dynamic counterpart refers to electrified roads or charging lanes enabled by charging-while-driving technology. A network equilibrium model is first developed to capture the interactions among battery electric vehicles’ (BEVs) route choices, charging plans, and the prices of electricity. A mixed-integer bi-level program is then formulated to determine the deployment plan of charging infrastructure to minimize the total social cost of the coupled networks. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate travel and charging plans of BEV drivers and the competitiveness of static and dynamic charging infrastructure. The numerical results on three networks suggest that (1) for individual BEV drivers, the choice between using charging lanes and charging stations is more sensitive to parameters including value of travel time, service fee markup, and battery size, but less sensitive to the charging rates and travel demand; (2) deploying more charging lanes is favorable for transportation networks with sparser topology while more charging stations can be more preferable for those denser networks.",1361-9209,Not found
Comparative assessment of accessibility metrics across the U.S.,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102328,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Accessibility-related research has advanced considerably since its foundational conception six decades ago. Yet, despite widespread acceptance of the concept, these methods are still rarely used in practical applications among transportation agencies and policymakers. Until recently, the challenges were mainly technical but now they are more practical. Practitioners are often faced with decisions about appropriate methods and metrics, which are difficult to answer from the current literature. This study attempts to produce a clearer understanding of the effects that those decisions have on practical outcomes, based on data spanning many geographies across the U.S. We test a variety of metrics—including different modes, destination types, analytical geographies, and metric definitions—in regions spanning seven states. This study points to several potential best practices, including the use of non-work walking accessibility metrics in multimodal analysis and the use of decay functions in accessibility metrics, and provides a strong foundation for future research.",1361-9209,Not found
Will autonomous vehicles change auto commuters’ value of travel time?,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102303,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"This paper examines the potential impact of autonomous vehicles on commuters’ value of travel time (VOTT). In particular, we focus on the effect on auto commuters in small and medium-sized metropolitan areas, concerning the spatial variability across urban areas, suburbs, and rural areas. We design a stated choice experiment to elicit potential changes in 1,881 auto commuters’ valuation of travel time in autonomous vehicles and apply a mixed logit model to quantify the changes in the value of travel time if taking autonomous vehicles. The results of this study suggest that the effect of autonomous vehicles on the VOTT is spatially differentiated. We find that riding in a private autonomous vehicle reduces the commuting VOTT of suburban, urban, and rural drivers by 32%, 24%, and 18%, respectively, compared to 14%, 13%, and 8% for riding in a shared autonomous vehicle. Finally, we discuss the implications of these lower values of time on transportation and land use planning.",1361-9209,Not found
A data perception model for the safe operation of high-speed rail in rainstorms,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102326,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"In order to solve the safety operation problems of High-speed rail (HSR) in different areas and different sections under the rainstorm condition, an early warning process for the rainstorm disaster is designed. Furthermore, in order to control the operation risk, a HSR operation program with different rainstorm degrees is given out based on the analysis of rainstorm warning mechanism and rainstorm warning threshold in this paper. In addition, considering the reality that natural conditions vary greatly and the rainfall is very uneven, a data perception model of rainstorm (DPM) is proposed with correction coefficients for solving the calculation problem of precipitation for rainstorm warning. The DPM mainly adopts Paulhus’s empirical equation and uses the linear function to improve it for calculating the precipitation, which is able to calculate the hourly precipitation in different regional environments, and also effectively evaluate the rainstorm warning level of high-speed rail in this period. It can calculate and monitor the process by big data and MATLAB. The result of case analysis shows that the DPM has good practical value for solving the safety operation problem of HSR in different areas under rainstorm environment.",1361-9209,Not found
Built environment effects on the integration of dockless bike-sharing and the metro,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102335,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Bike-sharing provides a convenient feeder mode for connecting to a metro and is believed to be an efficient way to solve the first- and last-mile problem. Despite the increasing attention paid on the use of bike-sharing, few studies have investigated how built environment factors affect the integrated use of dockless bike-sharing (DBS) and the metro. Using data from one of the largest DBS operators in China (Ofo), this paper employed a series of negative binomial regressions to examine the effect of the built environment on the integrated use of DBS and the metro, using Shenzhen as a case study. The findings show that mixed land use is positively related to integrated use. Residential areas have higher access-integrated rates during the morning peak hours, while industrial areas are associated with more integrated uses, connecting factories and metro stations. Furthermore, parks and public squares encourage both access- and egress-integrated use during peak times. Transportation facility features, including bus stops and dedicated bike lanes, are positively related to integrated use, while areas with dense metro distribution and main streets with many intersections are negatively related. Transfer distance also plays a crucial and negative role in integrated use. In addition, metro stations that are closer to the city center with a higher number of passengers are more likely to be integrated with bike-sharing. These findings can be used to collectively facilitate a connection between cycling and metro transit by creating a bicycle-friendly environment.",1361-9209,Not found
The power of reforming streets to boost access for human-scaled vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102336,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"This commentary argues for strategies to rapidly increase access by small, human-scaled modes in cities through changes to street designs. Such rapid transformations are necessary as part of responses to critical environmental, economic and public health challenges cities face. We explain that even though coordinated transport and land use planning is desirable, the built environment is mature and slow to change, while streets can and have changed in character and use frequently. This suggests that access to employment, amenities and services should be dramatically increased through reoriented street space toward human-scaled transport modes which will improve safety, reduce pollution, and save households and governments money.

Impact analysis of climate change on rail systems for adaptation planning: A UK case,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102324,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Climate change poses critical challenges for rail infrastructure and operations. However, the systematic analysis of climate risks and the associated costs of tackling them, particularly from a quantitative perspective, is still at an embryonic phase due to the kaleidoscopic nature of climate change impacts and lack of precise climatic data. To cope with such challenges, an advanced Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning (FBR) model is applied in this paper to understand climate threats of the railway system. This model ranks climate risks under high uncertainty in data and comprehensively evaluates these risks by taking account of infrastructure resilience and specific aspects of severity of consequence. Through conducting a nationwide survey on the British railway system, it dissects the status quo of primary climate risks. The survey implies that the top potential climate threats are heavy precipitation and floods. The primary risks caused by the climate threats are bridges collapsing and bridge foundation damage due to flooding and landslips. The findings can aid transport planners to prioritise climate risks and develop rational adaptation measures and strategies.",1361-9209,Not found
Is accessibility an idea whose time has finally come?,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102319,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"The idea that accessibility is the true goal for transportation planning goes back many decades, starting with notable writings in the 1950s, followed by a flurry of writings in the 1970s. Since then considerable academic work has gone into the development of accessibility measures, but their use in transportation planning is not yet pervasive. In this essay, I reflect on why progress toward the wholesale adoption of an accessibility-oriented approach in planning practice has been slow, review some of the promising efforts in recent years that suggest that transportation planning may be on the cusp of an accessibility era, and offer thoughts about the power of the accessibility concept as a framework for thinking about the urban environment.",1361-9209,Not found
Estimating road network accessibility during a hurricane evacuation: A case study of hurricane Irma in Florida,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102334,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Understanding the spatio-temporal road network accessibility during a hurricane evacuation—the level of ease of residents in an area in reaching evacuation destination sites through the road network—is a critical component of emergency management. While many studies have attempted to measure road accessibility (either in the scope of evacuation or beyond), few have considered both dynamic evacuation demand and characteristics of a hurricane. This study proposes a methodological framework to achieve this goal. In an interval of every six hours, the method first estimates the evacuation demand in terms of number of vehicles per household in each county subdivision (sub-county) by considering the hurricane’s wind radius and track. The closest facility analysis is then employed to model evacuees’ route choices towards the predefined evacuation destinations. The potential crowdedness index (PCI), a metric capturing the level of crowdedness of each road segment, is then computed by coupling the estimated evacuation demand and route choices. Finally, the road accessibility of each sub-county is measured by calculating the reciprocal of the sum of PCI values of corresponding roads connecting evacuees from the sub-county to the designated destinations. The method is applied to the entire state of Florida during Hurricane Irma in September 2017. Results show that I-75 and I-95 northbound have a high level of congestion, and sub-counties along the northbound I-95 suffer from the worst road accessibility. In addition, this research performs a sensitivity analysis for examining the impacts of different choices of behavioral response curves on accessibility results.",1361-9209,Not found
Multi-scale robustness model for highway networks under flood events,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102281,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Transportation system infrastructure often experiences severe flood-related disruptions such as overtopping, erosion, and scour. The ensuing damages can result in enormous direct and indirect economic losses to the traffic network and consequently the individuals through conditions like inaccessibility to commuters and reduction in traffic safety. Many studies have claimed that a robust transportation system could significantly prevent such consequences from natural hazards such as floods, highlighting the importance of robustness measures that could be used by decision-makers to properly manage flooded transportation system. Most available measures related to network robustness assessment are qualitative, and while some recent studies have focused on such evaluation using quantitative assessment approaches related to environmental or social-economic operations, they lack the holistic view towards robustness under flood events. This study develops a composite multi-scale transportation-system robustness model considering flood hazards by synthesizing geographical damage recognition, topological functionality analysis, network operation evaluation, and traffic-user loss estimation. This integrated model has been applied in a real-world highway network, mainly revealing that a given intensive flood occurrence at different locations may result in a variety of after-flood disruptions in the transportation network. To assist the asset owners with developing more reasonable prevention and recovery plans, the developed multi-scale robustness index presents both visible multi-denominational flood consequences and an overall post-event transportation-system robustness indicator.",1361-9209,Not found

Determinants of full and partial household evacuation decision making in hurricane matthew,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102313,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"This paper adds partial household evacuation to the traditional binary evacuate/stay decision. Based on data from a survey of Jacksonville, FL residents after Hurricane Matthew, multinomial (MNL) and random parameter MNL models were developed to determine the influential factors and whether some variables’ effects are more nuanced than prior literature suggests. The random parameter model was preferred to the fixed parameters model. Variables significant in this model included injury concern, certainty about hurricane impact location, age, marital status, family cohesion, and living in mobile or detached homes. Greater injury concern results in lower likelihood of none of the household evacuating and greater likelihood of partial evacuation, but lower likelihood of full household evacuation. Similarly, greater certainty about hurricane impact increased the probability of partial household evacuation but decreased the probability of full evacuation. Respondent age had heterogenous effects; for 85.54% of respondents, additional years of age increased the likelihood of the household staying. Married households had a higher likelihood of staying or evacuating together. Similarly, greater family cohesion was associated with the household remaining together. Living in mobile homes decreased the likelihood that all of the household stays or evacuates and increased the probability of partial household evacuation. Living in a single-family detached home was associated with lower likelihood of all of the household staying or evacuating and a greater likelihood of a partial household evacuation. These findings can inform strategies that influence full or partial household evacuations, material requirements based on these decisions, and ways to reduce family risk.",1361-9209,Not found
Effects of shadow evacuation on megaregion evacuations,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102295,83,2020-06-01,2020,6,"Transportation systems serve important roles during emergencies, in particular for evacuations. However, efficient travel during these life-and-death scenarios can be adversely impacted by external conditions, such as unnecessary and unneeded travel. This research sought to enhance the understanding of the effects of these conditions by analyzing shadow evacuations, and their impact on regional traffic operations in megaregions, more broadly. The research was based on simulations of a range of hurricane evacuation threat scenarios in the Gulf of Mexico building upon prior study using TRANSIMS. These assessments are also targeted at what many assume could be worst case evacuation conditions and pushing the limits of current simulation modeling capability. Among the broader findings of this work was that shadow evacuation participation rates did not significantly impact the evacuation clearance times within mandatory evacuation areas of the megaregion as long as demand could be temporarily spread out. This finding does not, however, suggest that the shadow evacuations have no impact on evacuation processes. High rates of shadow evacuees can cause significant congestion if they are not able to exit critical routes before mandatory evacuees reach areas further away from the coast.",1361-9209,Not found
Does green transportation promote accessibility for equity in medium-size U.S. cites?,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102365,84,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The link between accessibility and social equity attracts much attention for promoting sustainability. However, there is no comprehensive approach to elevate the role of accessibility in evaluating transportation system over social equity by considering the variety of urban opportunities and population groups from green transportation perspective. Our goal is to develop such a framework to evaluate transportation equity by focusing on accessibility via transit and cycling. Applying the framework to Fresno, California, and Cincinnati, Ohio with different development patterns, we delineate service areas at block-group level with five time-thresholds. The service area is used to count the number of urban opportunities: jobs, dining, churches, libraries, parks, multi-use paths, schools. We then use statistical comparison and geographical mapping to identify accessibility gap to these opportunities between advantaged and disadvantaged groups defined by income, property value, education, vehicle ownership, race, and age. The results indicate the extent of differences in accessibility is sensitive to threshold specification of grouping population. The findings suggest that the efficiency of transit service needs to be improved to reach the same level of cycling, while they do help with the accessibility for economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Considering school enrollment, the accessibility to opportunities in Fresno performs differently while students in Cincinnati benefit from good accessibility to most resources. The results of accessibility to multi-use paths highlight the need of providing more efficient green transportation facilities for less wealthy neighborhoods. Variation in accessibility between groups underscores the importance of developing policies to meet the needs of diverse social groups.",1361-9209,Not found

Random parameter models for estimating statewide daily bicycle counts using crowdsourced data,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102368,84,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Persistent lack of non-motorized traffic counts can affect the evidence-based decisions of transportation planning and safety-concerned agencies in making reliable investments in bikeway and other non-motorized facilities. Researchers have used various approaches to estimate bicycles counts, such as scaling, direct-demand modeling, time series, and others. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have tried to use crowdsourced data for estimating the bicycle counts. Crowdsourced data only represents a small percentage of cyclists. This percentage, on the other hand, can change based on the location, facility type, meteorological, and other factors. Moreover, the autocorrelation observed in bicycle counts may be different from the autocorrelation structure observed among crowdsourced platform users, such as Strava. Strava users are more consistent; hence, the time series count data may be stationary, while bicycle demand may vary based on seasonal factors. In addition to seasonal variation, several time-invariant contributing factors (e.g., facility type, roadway characteristics, household income) affect bicycle demand, which needs to be accounted for when developing direct demand models. In this paper, we use a mixed-effects model with autocorrelated errors to predict daily bicycle counts from crowdsourced data across the state of Texas. Additionally, we supplement crowdsourced data with other spatial and temporal factors such as roadway facility, household income, population demographics, population density and weather conditions to predict bicycle counts. The results show that using a robust methodology, we can predict bicycle demand with a 29% margin of error, which is significantly lower than merely scaling the crowdsourced data (41%).",1361-9209,Not found

This study focuses on the influence of land use and household properties on automobile travel demand. Car license plate recognition (CLPR) data, point-of-interest (POI) data, and housing information data were utilized to obtain automobile travel demand along with the land use and household properties. A geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model was adopted to deal with both the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of travel demand. The spatial-temporal patterns of GTWR coefficients were analyzed. Also, comparative analyses were carried out between automobile and total person travel demand, and among travel demand of taxis, heavily-used private cars, and total automobiles. The results show that: (I) The GTWR model has significantly higher accuracy compared with the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) model and the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, which means the GTWR model can measure both the spatial and temporal heterogeneity with high precision; (II) The influence of built environment and household properties on automobile travel demand varies with space and time. In particular, the temporal distribution of regression coefficients shows significant peak phenomenon; and (III) Comparative analyses indicate that residents’ preference for automobiles over other travel modes varies with their travel purpose and destination.

The threshold effects of bus micro-environmental exposures on passengers’ momentary mood,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102379,84,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The bus plays a crucial role in the daily travel of urban residents. Previous research on bus micro-environmental exposures and their adverse impacts on passengers’ health and comfort has attracted considerable attention. However, few studies to date have explored the correlation between bus micro-environmental exposures and passengers’ momentary mood, examined the thresholds of various micro-environmental factors, and analyzed the optimal micro-environmental exposure levels for passengers. To this end, both micro-environmental exposures and questionnaire survey data are simultaneously collected from 543 passengers in randomly selected buses operating on the 6 routes in Guangzhou, China. Multiple regression models are then applied to explore some research gaps in the existing literature. The results suggest that in-bus noise and passenger load have negative overall correlations with passengers’ momentary mood, whereas temperature and relative humidity have positive overall correlations with it. Passengers’ momentary mood is subject to the threshold effects of these four micro-environmental indicators. The thresholds of in-bus noise, temperature, and relative humidity identified in this study are 65–79 dB, 30–34 °C, and 50–65% respectively. In terms of passenger load, 8–18 is a threshold below which momentary mood gets worse, and 19–29 is the other threshold beyond which momentary mood deteriorates considerably. Further, the optimal exposure levels of these bus micro-environmental indicators are 0–65 dB, 22–28 °C, 41–50%, and 18–19 respectively. These threshold effects provide valuable implications for transportation planners and bus operators to achieve desirable and user-friendly in-bus micro-environment based on a better understanding of the changes in passengers’ momentary mood.",1361-9209,Not found

With this purpose, this paper describes the development and testing of a new 3D tool built using ArcGIS scripts, which has been created for this task. This tool provides “enhanced information” that can enrich the scenarios used in the decision-making process that accompanies noise action plans. The new tool was tested in a residential area crossed by the A-376 highway, in the province of Seville, Spain, since the use of real data can better show the capabilities of the new methodology. The tool was validated with a benchmark test using 20 stretches of the highway chosen at random among areas with the population exposed to more than 50 dB. The results show a relative mean error of 1.33% after analyzing 3597 receivers above 50 dB. This contributes to the credibility and confidence in the method. It was also proved that the new tool represents a substantial improvement in the detection of noise hot-spots compared to similar tools in 2D. Finally, one of the most important conclusions is that the new tool defines more precisely the extent of the road noise problem, determining exactly the contribution of each section of the road in each of the noise problems diagnosed by the road noise maps. Among other things, this makes it easy to quickly discard inefficient noise mitigation measures.",1361-9209,Not found
Spatial–economic impact of missing national highway links on China's regional economy,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102377,84,2020-07-01,2020,7,"The widespread missing link phenomenon in transport networks has been identified in numerous countries. How regional economy responds to missing links has remained a ‘missing link’. This study aims to fill the gap through investigating the spatial–economic impacts of missing links on the regional economy in the case of missing national highway links (ML-Hs) in China. Taking the difference of the regional road accessibility values between planned and real scenarios, this paper finds that the spatial impact of missing national highway links on regional road accessibility varies across Chinese cities. Cities that are directly associated with missing national highway links or in Southwest China are most vulnerable to the road accessibility reductions caused by missing national highway links. We also estimate the spatial–economic impacts of missing national highway links on regional economy using prefecture-level cross-sectional data in China. Econometric results confirm that missing national highway links induced road accessibility reductions negatively associate with the regional economy in the maximum and minimum distance decay scenarios, implying that regional economy decreases with the increase in the level of missing highway links induced road accessibility reductions. Interestingly, cities with missing national highways are positively associated with regional economy, suggesting that the persistence of missing national highway links in developed cities is at the expense of less developed cities which are more sensitive to missing highway links induced road accessibility reductions. Such asymmetrical results provide empirical evidence on the distributive effect of missing national highway links on China’s regional economy.",1361-9209,Not found

Active travel as a pro-environmental behaviour: An integrated framework,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102356,84,2020-07-01,2020,7,"A travel mode may be chosen due to its emotional appeal (affective motive) or to express social status (symbolic motive). Previous studies have overlooked the role of such motives in active mode use as pro-environmental behaviour. This study aims to examine the role of symbolic and affective motives, together with other significant theoretical perspectives, to explain the share of active modes of transport in trips to the university. It adds to the previous literature by considering the share of active modes of transport in different seasons. We collected a total of 316 completely filled questionnaires (response rate = 75.4 percent) from a cross-sectional self-administered survey in February 2019 in Trondheim, Norway. Among the psychological variables related to active mode use, only affective motives were found significant in both summer and winter. Environmental self-identity predicted both types of motives. No evidence suggested that personal environmental norms and attitudes towards transportation significantly explained active mode share, although car-related subjective norms reached significance. Furthermore, there was no evidence that environmental attitudes towards transportation had a mediating effect between motives and active mode use. Cycling journey time between place of residence and campus was found significant in the share of active modes of transport in both seasons. The results have important ramifications for the provision of relevant regulations and raising positive support from society to enhance the share of active modes of travel to the university.",1361-9209,Not found
The social acceptance of airport expansion scenarios: A factorial survey experiment,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102363,84,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Against the background of growing aviation and protests against air traffic in many countries, we employ a factorial survey experiment to examine the social acceptance of airport expansion scenarios in two European cities located near the international airports of Frankfurt (Germany) and Zurich (Switzerland), respectively. In our experiment, respondents evaluated short descriptions of airport expansion scenarios that varied in several impact attributes. The experiment helps to disentangle to what extent environmental impacts (aircraft noise), economic impacts (job creation), participatory justice aspects (participation opportunities), and distributive justice aspects (noise distribution) affect social acceptance. The experimental results show that environmental and participatory justice aspects are much more influential than economic and distributive justice impacts. Higher expected exposure to aircraft noise and less opportunities of citizen participation in an aircraft expansion project lead to increased levels of expressed unfairness of the expansion, to a greater willingness to sign a petition, to participate in a demonstration, and to vote against the expansion. Combining survey data and data on actual noise exposure, we find that those with very low and very high actual exposure levels, respectively, express the lowest social acceptance. Further analyses reveal that age, environmental concern, own use of air travel, and perceived fairness of the local aircraft noise distribution explain heterogeneity in social acceptance.",1361-9209,Not found
"Car sharing in Norwegian urban areas: Examining interest, intention and the decision to enrol",10.1016/j.trd.2020.102322,84,2020-07-01,2020,7,"This article’s objective is to investigate the effects of sociodemographic and residential built environments, directly and indirectly through personality traits, attitudes and car ownership, on willingness to use car sharing in the case of Norway. This is done by examining multiple dimensions of the adoption process: the stated general interest and intention to participate in car sharing among non-members, as well as the decision to enrol as a car sharing user by comparing members to non-members. In this study, we analyse web survey data from 2414 residents from urban areas in Norway, using three structural equation models. Our findings indicate that the adoption of car sharing is complexly related to car ownership, with a noteworthy discrepancy indicating greater car sharing interest, but lower car sharing membership rates among car owners. We also find that environmental concerns exert a clear positive effect on all three dimensions of the adoption process. Being careful with money is linked negatively to interest and intention to participate, while being sociable and agreeable exerts no effect. Car sharers’ sociodemographic profiles are typically that of early adopters, but many of the effects, especially on interest, are mediated by car ownership, environmental consciousness and/or being careful with money, rather than directly on the sociodemographic profiles. Finally, we find car sharing to be more prominent in denser areas, but we did not discover a clear connection with access to public transport.",1361-9209,Not found
Impact of Visible-Solar-Light-Driven photocatalytic pavement on air quality improvement,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102341,84,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Photocatalytic pavement has attracted significant interest in the past decades by both the academia and industry for its ability of spontaneous cleaning of air pollutants, such as motor vehicle exhaust gas. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is used as the photocatalyst that is mixed into pavement materials or coated on the pavement to remove motor vehicle exhaust gases, e.g., carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), under the irradiation of the solar light. However, the pure TiO2 additive only absorbs the light within the ultraviolet region due to its large bandgap. One approach to increase the ability of TiO2 to the utilization of the full spectrum of the solar light is doping TiO2. Therefore, this visible-solar-light-driven photocatalytic pavement embedded with doped-TiO2 will exhibits a better cleaning efficiency of exhaust gas. This work conducted computational simulations of the cleaning efficiency on reducing exhaust gas NO2 by photocatalytic pavement with doped-TiO2, and its subsequent influence on the air quality in the surrounding environment. A three-dimensional model was developed for a section of pavement and its vicinal region. Effects of weather conditions, doped-TiO2 coverages, road widths and traffic flow conditions on the removal of NO2 and its influence to the adjacent environment were studied. Results indicate that visible-solar-light-driven photocatalytic pavement with doped-TiO2 features a significantly higher removal efficiency of exhaust gas compared with the normal photocatalytic pavement. Moreover, the doped-TiO2 embedded pavement is effective to remove NO2 with different traffic densities and wind conditions, and consequently improve the air quality of the surrounding environment.",1361-9209,Not found

To reduce the pollution caused by their operations, SSS companies are required to comply with increasingly stringent environmental regulations enacted by global and regional authorities such as the European Union and the International Maritime Organization. However, the companies tend to regard those regulations as imposing an additional burden of cost that compromises their capacity to enhance their economic performance. This paper examines the impact of external institutional driver namely regulatory pressure on the adoption of green innovations in SSS and in turn, the impact of those innovations on the environmental and economic performance of SSS companies. To investigate the hypothesised relationships of those constructs, a structural equation model was developed and tested with data from a survey conducted amongst 101 short sea shipping companies headquartered in Europe. As detailed in the paper, the analysis revealed that regulatory pressure has generated green innovations that have enhanced the environmental and economic performance of European SSS companies and, as a result, led to a win–win situation for all parties involved. The paper discusses what those findings imply for SSS firm managers and policymakers who seek to improve the environmental or economic performance of Europe’s SSS industry.",1361-9209,Not found
Determining the optimal electric vehicle DC-charging infrastructure for Western Australia,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102250,84,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Take-up rates of electric vehicles (EV) are increasing and are predicted to accelerate rapidly. Public EV charging networks will be required to support future EV fleets. If unplanned, public charging networks are highly likely to be suboptimal. Planners need to understand and plan for future EV charging infrastructure requirements, particularly public DC fast charging networks, as both the upfront investment costs and the consequences of misallocation are high. However, the task of determining the optimal locations and allocations (types and numbers) of public EV charging infrastructure is complicated as it requires knowledge of many variables.

Survey responses from 471 university students in Taiwan were collected. Data were analysed using factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Respondents with different levels of usage intention and in different stages of behavioural change display distinct reasoning patterns. Lack of perceived compatibility with personal values, mobility needs and life-style particularly drives students with low usage intention and pre-contemplators, who show signs of “green hypocrisy”. Awareness-knowledge about the sharing system and environmental values influence the formation of usage intention in indirect ways.

Variability in sound power levels: Implications for static and dynamic traffic models,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102339,84,2020-07-01,2020,7,"Classically, one mean vehicle representative of each category is used by both static and dynamic traffic noise prediction models. The spectrum associated with this mean vehicle is determined from a linear statistical regression analysis based on measurement campaigns on a track or in situ. However, the variability of individual vehicle emissions can influence predictions and hinder comparison between static and dynamic models. In order to estimate the induced bias, statistical analysis of the distributions of sound power levels emitted by the individual passage of vehicles during 82 measurement campaigns was carried out. The results show that 92% of the residual regression distributions are Gaussian and that standard deviations can reach 3.6 dBA. The value of the proposed correction term for this case study could reach 1.4 dBA for light vehicles and 1.2 dBA for heavy vehicles. This analysis also shows that the variability in sound power levels and thus the corresponding corrections are higher at the lowest speeds that correspond to urban driving conditions.",1361-9209,Not found

A post-disaster resource allocation framework for improving resilience of interdependent infrastructure networks,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102455,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Extreme events can greatly impact the functionalities of infrastructure networks. The ability of an infrastructure network to restore its before-the-event functionality after the occurrence of an extreme event, being recognized as one of the most important aspects of resilience, is also one area where the resilience of the infrastructure network can be improved. To expedite the recovery of the infrastructure network after an extreme event, it is essential to allocate limited repair crews properly to disrupted infrastructure facilities. The loss and recovery of infrastructure functionalities are further complicated by infrastructure interdependencies, which can lead to the propagation of the impact of an extreme event to all infrastructure facilities in the network. The interdependent nature of infrastructure networks also complicates the process of optimally allocating repair crews and the effectiveness assessment of an allocation strategy. This paper proposes a methodological framework, by combining agent-based modeling and reinforcement learning, to assess the effectiveness of a repair crew allocation strategy and optimize the strategy after an extreme event, with which the impact of the extreme event can be better mitigated.",1361-9209,Not found

The research framework consists of three modules: the development of a drivers’ behavior model; implementation of vehicle idling control; and the estimation of GHG emissions. This framework has been materialized in Haeundae-gu in Busan, Korea as a case study. The results revealed reductions of GHG emissions by 10.9% and 56.8% of the stationary and idling vehicles, respectively, proving the environmental benefit of the red time TSCT with the drivers’ voluntary involvement.

Demand forecast of public transportation considering positive and negative mass effects,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102466,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Demand forecast of new public transportation (PT) is essential for appropriate policymaking. In the forecasting process, the effects of social interactions on individual choices are attracting considerable attention. Traditionally, these interactions have been evaluated in the relationship between the individual’s behavior and the group’s behavior. Conformity has thus become a central issue in this interaction for its mass effect. In the case of PT usage, an individual will have a higher propensity for PT usage when more people in his/her preference group use it. This study shows the need to add an issue, in-vehicle congestion, to the interaction analysis. When more people use PT, occupancy increases and the vehicles become congested, making PT a less attractive option. Both the positive mass effect of conformity and the negative mass effect of in-vehicle congestion on individual choices of PT usage were addressed using an equilibrium calculation based on the estimated utility function of PT usage. For the new PT system to be constructed in Ho Chi Minh City, usage proportions for student, company employee, and government employee groups were estimated of 19.6%, 10.4%, and 10.2%, respectively. A congestion ratio of 61% was found to be the social equilibrium of PT usage and of travel demand for commuting trips by PT. These findings provide an improved, practical picture of the future usage of the new PT system, which is beneficial to effective policymaking and planning.",1361-9209,Not found

This paper proposes an extended Data Envelopment Analysis (i.e., DEA), namely the unified Bounded-adjusted Measure (BAM), to measure the variable-specific technical inefficiency and the corresponding productivity change of highway transport sector during 2006–2015 in China. Note that, through the analysis of total factor decomposition, this paper seeks the key points for the safe operation and emissions reduction of provincial highway transportation sector in China. The results show that the quantity of traffic accidents, CO2 emissions from highway transport sector, along with investment constitute important source leading to the inefficiency of highway transport sector in China. The static inefficiency values associated with conventional provinces whose value added growth relies on transportation is high. Regarding Luenberger productivity indicator, the reduction of traffic accidents has had a significant positive effect on total factor productivity (TFP), and has been slightly better than the weak positive effect of CO2 emissions reduction since 2006. Thus, in the latter stage, Chinese highway transportation policy should address the regulation on CO2 emissions. From the perspective of decoupling theory, China's overall road transport output value is coordinated with the quantity of traffic accidents and CO2 emissions, but the internal differentiation appears.",1361-9209,Not found
Global warming potential optimization of a turbofan powered unmanned aerial vehicle during surveillance mission,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102472,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Gas emissions from all sources including air transport contribute to global warming. There are tremendous efforts to decrease the greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors. In this study, for a turbofan engine powered unmanned aerial vehicle, Global Warming Potential (GWP) calculations have been performed covering a range of flight Mach number and altitude. Unmanned aerial vehicles have different mission profiles and usage characteristics than manned aircraft. Therefore their emissions are also different than manned aircraft due to different flight altitude, loitering (surveillance) speed and engine power setting etc. Global warming potential was calculated with a genuine code combining aircraft performance, engine performance and exhaust gas emissions for all flight points during surveillance mission. Exhaust gases of CO2, H2O and NOx were calculated and at each leg of flight as they contribute to GWP. Results were presented to illustrate the GWP magnitudes for different flight speed and altitude in a comparative manner for the turbofan powered UAV. Optimization calculations were done by using genetic algorithm. For an investigated range of 6–16 km flight altitude and 0.25–0.75 flight Mach number, total surveillance mission GWP is lowest around 13 km and 0.37 Mach number as optimum values.

We examine four scenarios: business-as-usual (BAU), development first (DEVF), carbon neutrality (CNT) and synchronous (SYNCH). Our synchronous scenario pathway reduces the crude oil and natural gas imports by 68% for the year 2050 compared to 2012 in the BAU scenario, leading to foreign exchange saving of 5.8 trillion US$ during 2013–2050.

Two different planners’ objectives namely, total system travel time and total system net energy consumption are considered. Besides these objectives, constraints such as agency budget, range reassurance, and equity in resource distribution are also addressed at the planner’s level.

The framework is applied to analyze container handling in Norway from 2010 to 2015. The results indicate that increasing ship sizes lead to more pollution per hour spent berthing, but at the same time it often leads to higher container handling productivities and thus possibly to ships spending less time in port per container loaded/unloaded. While technical changes are found to reduce the duration of container handling by about 2–3 percent per quarter, port container handling productivity and efficiency changes appear to be the main drivers of environmental productivity growth.",1361-9209,Not found

The results suggest that RAP can be used as an unbound material in environments except those acidic (i.e., pH < 5 as in mines with sulfur-containing minerals and landfills with acidic environment).",1361-9209,Not found
"Deciphering the relationship between bikesharing and public transit: Modal substitution, integration, and complementation",10.1016/j.trd.2020.102392,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Public bikesharing systems (PBSs) have witnessed rapid growth in the last decade. Bikesharing has been found to have a mixed relationship with public transit, but such a relationship has not been well quantified. This research uses real bikesharing trip data in four cities that host the largest bikesharing fleets in the U.S. to investigate when, where, and to what extent bikesharing trips substitute, integrate with, and complement public transit, and what factors contribute to the modal integration between bikesharing and public transit. The results show that it is not where the bikesharing trip takes place that predominantly determines its relationship with public transit but rather when the trip happens (weekday or weekend and what time period during the day) and who takes the trip (a subscriber or customer). Regression models show that modal integration is associated with shorter trip duration, higher public transit service frequency, and higher share of subscribers on weekdays. The relatively high share of bikesharing trips that integrate with public transit helps to improve the experience of riding public transit and in the long term, enhances urban mobility and reduces automobile dependency with multiple beneficial societal and environmental effects.",1361-9209,Not found
Missing links – Quantifying barrier effects of transport infrastructure on local accessibility,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102410,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Transport infrastructure can create efficient connections in traffic systems, yet it can also create barriers to movement on a local scale. In transport infrastructure projects there is a need for methods to quantify these barrier effects – also called severance – to assess their impacts on social inclusion, health and viability of businesses. This paper proposes four local accessibility indicators to measure direct barrier effects: Travel time, Choice, Catchment and Service efficiency. The indicators are tested in a case study where the consequences of placing a motorway and a railway in tunnels are assessed. The results show how local accessibility is affected in non-linear patterns. The paper contributes to accessibility literature by introducing direct barrier effects as an applied case of local accessibility, and demonstrates the potential of those indicators to quantify barrier effects. Finally, it offers accessibility as a theoretical framework for further developing theories on barrier effects.",1361-9209,Not found
Integrated life cycle assessment of permeable pavement: Model development and case study,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102381,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The permeable pavement has exceptional environmental benefits compared to the traditional hardening pavement. However, few studies have been conducted on the evaluation of the life cycle impacts of permeable pavement. By developing an integrated life cycle evaluation method, this paper aims to comprehensively evaluate the life cycle benefits of permeable pavement from the perspective of both the economic cost and the environmental impact, thus realizing a comprehensive trade-off of impacts of permeable pavement. In the case study, the economic cost and environmental impact of Permeable Asphalt pavement (PA) and Dense-graded Asphalt pavement (DA) with different traffic volumes and structures are compared under the same functional unit and environmental conditions. The results show that PA's high investment in raw material and maintenance makes its economic cost higher than DA, whereas the environmental benefits are considerable. However, the results of the uncertainty analysis indicate that the application of PA still needs caution when the environmental conditions are unstable. This study can act as a supplement to the existing life cycle research of the permeable pavement, and provide theoretical support and reference for its further promotion and application.",1361-9209,Not found

We propose an LTS-based classification with two components: a clustering component and an interpretative component. Our methodology is comprised of four steps: (i) compilation of a set of variables for road segments, (ii) generation of clusters of segments within a subset of the road network, (iii) classification of all segments of the road network into these clusters using a predictive model, and (iv) assignment of an LTS category to each cluster. At the core of the methodology, we couple a classifier (unsupervised clustering algorithm) with a predictive model (multinomial logistic regression) to make our approach scalable to massive data sets. Our methodology is a useful tool for policy-making, as it identifies suitable areas for interventions; and can estimate their impact on the LTS classification, according to probable changes to the input variables (e.g., traffic density). We applied our methodology on the road network of Bogotá, Colombia, a city with a history of implementing innovative policies to promote biking. To classify road segments, we combined government data with open-access repositories using geographic information systems (GIS). Comparing our LTS classification with city reports, we found that the number of bicyclists’ fatal and non-fatal collisions per kilometer is positively correlated with higher LTS. Finally, to support policy making, we developed a web-enabled dashboard to visualize and analyze the LTS classification and its underlying variables.",1361-9209,https://github.com/paezha/Neighborhood-Perceptions-and-Active-Travel-in-Bangladesh
Benefit of speed reduction for ships in different weather conditions,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102337,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Currently, the shipping industry is facing a great challenge of reducing emissions. Reducing ship speeds will reduce the emissions in the immediate future with no additional infrastructure. However, a detailed investigation is required to verify the claim that a 10% speed reduction would lead to 19% fuel savings (Faber et al., 2012). This paper investigates fuel savings due to speed reduction using detailed modeling of ship performance. Three container ships, two bulk carriers, and one tanker, representative of the shipping fleet, have been designed. Voyages have been simulated by modeling calm water resistance, wave resistance, propulsion efficiency, and engine limits. Six ships have been simulated in various weather conditions at different speeds. Potential fuel savings have been estimated for a range of speed reductions in realistic weather. It is concluded that the common assumption of cubic speed-power relation can cause a significant error in the estimation of bunker consumption. Simulations in different seasons have revealed that fuel savings due to speed reduction are highly weather dependent. Therefore, a simple way to include the effect of weather in shipping transport models has been proposed. Speed reduction can lead to an increase in the number of ships to fulfill the transport demand. Therefore, the emission reduction potential of speed reduction strategy, after accounting for the additional ships, has been studied. Surprisingly, when the speed is reduced by 30%, fuel savings vary from 2% to 45% depending on ship type, size and weather conditions. Fuel savings further reduce when the auxiliary engines are considered.",1361-9209,Not found
"Accessibility to transit, by transit, and property prices: Spatially varying relationships",10.1016/j.trd.2020.102387,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Accessibility to transit facilities is perceived to affect property prices. However, accessibility by transit has rarely elicited adequate scholarly attention in property price analyses. Additionally, previous studies on how transit accessibility affects property prices mainly focused on rail and bus rapid transit systems, while conventional bus transit, which is very popular in many contexts, has seldom been investigated. Moreover, whether there is spatial heterogeneity in the price (or capitalization) effects of conventional bus accessibility remains to be explored. To fill these gaps, this study aims to investigate the role of accessibility to and by bus in determining housing prices in a bus-dependent city where urban transit service is offered mainly by a bus system rather than other transit systems. Using a database of 4966 condominium units in Xiamen, China, this study develops a battery of spatial econometric models to estimate global and local relationships between to-bus and by-bus accessibility and housing prices. The findings are as below: (1) to-bus accessibility (measured by the number of nearby bus stops) is positively associated with nearby housing prices; (2) by-bus accessibility (measured by travel time to city centers by bus and bus frequency) significantly affects nearby housing prices; (3) spatial heterogeneity exists in the price effects of bus accessibility; and (4) bus frequency exerts a larger price effect in the peripheral area than in the central. Finally, practical and policy implications are discussed.",1361-9209,Not found
"Electric bicycle mode substitution for driving, public transit, conventional cycling, and walking",10.1016/j.trd.2020.102412,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"The key to understanding the impacts of electric bicycles (e-bikes) on congestion, the environment, and public health is to what extent they displace travel by other (particularly motorized) modes of transportation. This study investigates the mode substitution effects of e-bikes, based on a meta-analysis of 38 observations of mode substitution patterns reported in 24 published studies from around the world. Median mode substitution reported in the literature is highest for public transit (33%), followed by conventional bicycle (27%), automobile (24%), and walking (10%), but varies widely with interquartile ranges of 31% for auto and 44% for public transit. Weighted mixed logit model results indicate a trade-off in substitution of motorized modes, with significantly greater displacement of public transit in China and greater displacement of auto travel elsewhere (Europe, North America, and Australia). Newer studies report greater displacement of driving and walking and less displacement of conventional bicycle trips, which indicates a positive trend. Results also suggest that e-bike adoption may be part of a transition away from conventional bicycle use, while displacing auto and transit travel after adoption. Further studies are needed in the context of evolving forms of micromobility, particularly outside of northern Europe and China.",1361-9209,Not found
Time-dependent resilience analysis of a road network in an extreme environment,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102395,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Road networks, especially those built in an extreme environment, are at risk of service failure after long-term exposure to various types of disruptive events. With growing costs of service failure, it has become increasingly important to evaluate the dynamic operability characteristics, i.e., the dynamic resilience, of road networks. However, existing studies in this field generally considered a one-time disaster event during a relatively short period, and thus became insufficient for assessing the resilience of road networks in an extreme environment with frequent disaster events. This paper aims to propose a Time-dependent Resilience Analysis Framework (TIDRAF) by modeling the dynamic resilience of a road network in an extreme environment (where there are frequent disruptive events) and sequential repair actions. The original resilience triangle diagram is extended into a long-term paradigm to fit the road network with its frequent-disaster environment. The road network in the Tibetan Plateau, which has for years severely suffered from frequent disaster events, was selected as the case to validate the proposed TIDRAF. Based on the results of the analysis, three optimization strategies are presented to improve the resilience of the network against failures.",1361-9209,Not found
A cycling-focused accessibility tool to support regional bike network connectivity,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102388,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Many cities in the United States are working to become more “bike-friendly” through the provision of new bike infrastructure that is safe and attractive for all types of cyclists, from the timid to assured. These efforts are supported by evidence associating low level of traffic stress facilities with increased cycling activity rates and co-benefits related to the economy, environment, and public health. However, not every mile of bike infrastructure provides the same utility, prompting planning agencies with finite financial resources to search for empirical methods to help evaluate what projects will provide the greatest network connectivity benefit and how disparate projects can complement one another to produce a complete bike network. In this study, we introduce the Cyclist Routing Algorithm for Network Connectivity (CRANC), an accessibility-oriented decision-support tool designed to quantify the benefits of new bike facilities for various populations and neighborhoods. Unlike prior tools, this method simulates the route preferences of different cyclist types and trade-offs in travel time and level of traffic stress to model potential changes in destination accessibility that may result from multiple scenarios of citywide and regional bike network expansion. Here, CRANC is applied to the Boston region’s bike network to determine how a proposed shared-use path in Cambridge, Massachusetts will improve accessibility to regional job opportunities and to labor force for employment sites in Cambridge. Our introduced decision-support tool produces unique, meaningful results relevant to a variety of stakeholders, and holds promise as a new resource for transportation researchers and practitioners.",1361-9209,https://github.com/Hussein-Mahfouz/cycle-networks

Incorporating public transport in a methodology for assessing resilience in urban mobility,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102386,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Resilience has gained importance in the current research and policy agendas as it incorporates concepts of adaptation and transformation. Urban areas are complex systems exposed to different shocks, which have impacts on its various components. Research in transport has already incorporated the concept of resilience with more or less sophisticated approaches that are intensive on data and technical expertise. There is a need to explore the incorporation of resilience in simpler and less data intensive methods that can be easily applied in a wider range of contexts. One of the aims of this research is to develop a method that can use commonly available mobility management tools allowing smaller urban areas to analyse and plan for resilience. We present a new development of a method to assess resilience in transport systems with a commonly used mobility management tool (the origin-destination matrix) for calculating an overall measurement of resilience. The method assumes that car trips are transferred to active modes or to the available public transport routes in the event of any disruption in the system. We consider different scenarios of availability of public transport in case of disruptive events. We applied the method to two urban areas in Brazil. The variation of the contribution of the public transport presents patterns comparable between the two cases. The spatial distribution of trips shows the relative importance of resilient trips and the cities’ spatial structure. The inclusion of public transport routes has an impact on the levels of accessibility of lower income users.",1361-9209,Not found
Empirical analysis of walkability using data from the Netherlands,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102390,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"In urban planning and transportation research, indices have been developed to measure the walkability of neighborhoods based on land-use and transportation characteristics. Despite the extensive work on the development of walkability measures, the empirical validation of the measures has received only limited attention. The aim of this study is to test assumptions made in existing walkability indices. Based on a national neighborhood data set combined with three years of national travel survey data from the Netherlands, the relationships between physical neighborhood characteristics and walking frequency are identified through regression analysis. In the regression model, distance to supermarket, number of daily goods stores within 1 km, number of cafeterias within 1 km, total inland water, land use for residential buildings, and high urban density were found to be significant. Our analysis indicates that existing indices only partly capture variation in walkability. We find that mismatches emerge on the level of both the selection and weighting of variables.

30 Years of soft interventions to reduce car use – A systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102397,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Soft travel interventions are generally regarded as effective measures for reducing personal car use. However, doubts about the validity of such claims are raised, primarily fueled by the low methodological quality of evaluation studies upon which such conclusions are based and by the fact that the literature is, for the most part, narratively synthesized. The present systematic review addresses these critiques by investigating the effect of soft interventions on car use through a meta-analysis, which includes only experimental and well-controlled quasi-experimental studies. Results revealed that interventions (k = 41) lead to a significant reduction of 7% in car modal split share (Hedges’ g = 0.163). Moderators of interventions’ effectiveness were investigated in a meta-regression. Effectiveness was moderated by the type of intervention and by the main psychological variable targeted by the interventions, whereas the other studied moderators (i.e. residential relocation of participants, study design, percentage of females in the study, the presence of incentives, passed time to follow-up, interventions’ measurement instrument, city size in which interventions were applied and the setting where they were conducted) were non-significant.

Seaport investments in capacity and natural disaster prevention,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102367,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Most seaports face constraints in financial resources to some degree, and thus need to balance the investments in capacity and natural disaster prevention. On the one hand, due to budget constraint, limited resources need to be allocated between the two tasks. On the other hand, the benefit of natural disaster prevention investment is likely to be higher for ports with larger capacity. This study builds a stylized analytical model to examine the managerial and policy implications of such interactions between the two counteracting mechanisms. We find that the port managers would always prioritize capacity investment over natural disaster prevention investment. Social welfare maximizing ports invest more in both capacity and disaster prevention than those chosen by profit maximizing operators. However, compared with profit maximizing ports, welfare maximizing ports also require a larger budget to justify the investment in disaster prevention. Moreover, with increasing intensity of natural disaster, a port’s capacity investment decreases and its disaster prevention investment increases, irrespective of its objective. The magnitudes of both changes are larger for welfare maximizing ports than for profit maximizing ports.",1361-9209,Not found
Transit oriented development and retail: Is variation in success explained by a gap between theory and practice?,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102357,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Central to the concept of Transit Oriented Development (TOD) is a retail core situated around stations. However, successful retail near light rail transit stations has been elusive. Despite significant implications for land use, transportation, and economic development planning, little research exists to explain the gap between TOD concept and reality. We hypothesize that the density, diversity, and design characteristics central to the theory of TODs drive retail success. We implement a TOD Index proposed in the literature to score 474 light rail station areas in 11 metropolitan areas according to the presence and magnitude of those density, diversity, and design characteristics. A series of robustly-developed multilevel models support our hypothesis: TOD Index scores significantly predict station area retail employment, ceteris paribus. An evaluation of its subcomponents individually (block size, which relates to walkability; land use mix; and activity density) suggests activity density may be the driving force in this relationship. Our research works to move the conversation away from an assumption that transit stations and retail naturally co-exist and toward more intentional station area design choices demonstrated to drive retail employment.",1361-9209,Not found
Port disruptions due to natural disasters: Insights into port and logistics resilience,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102393,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"Ports are located in low-lying coastal and riverine areas making them prone to the physical impacts of natural disasters. The consequential disruptions can potentially propagate through supply chains, resulting in widespread economic losses. Previous studies to quantify the risks of port disruptions have adopted various modelling assumptions about the resilience of individual ports and marine network logistics. However, limited empirical evidence is available to validate these modelling assumptions or to provide deeper understanding of the ways in which operations are adapted during and after disruptions. Here, we use vessel tracking data to analyse past port disruptions due to natural disasters, evaluating 141 incidences of disruptions across 74 ports and 27 disasters. Results show a median disruption duration of six days with a 95th percentile of 22.2 days. All analysed events show multiple ports being affected simultaneously, challenging some of the studies that only focus on single port disruptions. Moreover, we find that the duration of the disruption scales with the severity of the event, with an increment of 1.0 m storm surge or 10 m/s wind speed associated with a two day increase in disruption duration. In contrast to commonplace assumptions in model studies, substitution between ports is rarely observed during short-term disruptions. On the other hand, production recapture happens in practice in many cases of port disruptions. In short, empirical vessel tracking data provides valuable insights for future modelling studies in order to better approximate the extent of the disruption and the potential resilience of the port and maritime network.",1361-9209,Not found
Electric and hydrogen buses: Shifting from conventionally fuelled cars in the UK,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102350,85,2020-08-01,2020,8,"For the UK to meet their national target of net zero emissions as part of the central Paris Agreement target, further emphasis needs to be placed on decarbonizing public transport and moving away from personal transport (conventionally fuelled vehicles (CFVs) and electric vehicles (EVs)). Electric buses (EBs) and hydrogen buses (HBs) have the potential to fulfil requirements if powered from low carbon renewable energy sources. A comparison of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced from conventionally fuelled buses (CFB), EBs and HBs between 2017 and 2050 under four National Grid electricity scenarios was conducted. In addition, emissions per person at different vehicle capacity levels (100%, 75%, 50% and 25%) were projected for CFBs, HBs, EBs and personal transport assuming a maximum of 80 passengers per bus and four per personal vehicle. Results indicated that CFVs produced 30 gCO2 km−1 per person compared to 16.3 gCO2 km−1 per person by CFBs by 2050. At 100% capacity, under the two-degree scenario, CFB emissions were 36 times higher than EBs, 9 times higher than HBs and 12 times higher than EVs in 2050. Cumulative emissions under all electricity scenarios remained lower for EBs and HBs. Policy makers need to focus on encouraging a modal shift from personal transport towards sustainable public transport, primarily EBs as the lowest level emitting vehicle type. Simple electrification of personal vehicles will not meet the required targets. Simultaneously, CFBs need to be replaced with EBs and HBs if the UK is going to meet emission targets.",1361-9209,Not found

A total of 211 peer-reviewed research articles published between 2009 and 2019 covering the main categories consumer intentions – adoption intention, purchase intention, behavioural intention, and usage intention, – were selected. This study categorises influential factors, into four main types, namely demographic, situational, contextual, and psychological. A comprehensive overview of the theoretical perspectives was also developed to understand adoption behaviour and a consumer’s intentions towards EVs. The findings provide the most common research methodology employed for testing, analysing and comparing the relations among EV factors. A simple meta-analysis shows that the trend of studies on the influencing factors for adopting EVs has increased significantly over the past decade.

High-speed rail development and urban environmental efficiency in China: A city-level examination,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102456,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"High-speed rail (HSR) is among the most efficient and environmentally friendly transportation methods available today. Following a phase of rapid HSR development, China has built 35,000 km of operational rail network—the largest in the world. It is important to evaluate the role HSR has played in promoting the sustainable development of Chinese cities. In this study, a heterogeneous stochastic frontier model with undesirable outputs was implemented to measure the environmental efficiency of 273 cities in China from 2005 to 2017. Results showed that the average environmental efficiency increased by 48.7% during this period although there was differentiation between cities. Next, we introduced a difference-in-differences model employing an instrumental variable strategy for further analysis. Results revealed that the implementation of HSR significantly improved the environmental efficiency of the investigated cities. Considering that ordinary-speed rail (OSR) accounts for 74.8% of the total railway network area in China, this study also examined the interactive effect of HSR and OSR. The findings suggested that the positive environmental effects of HSR were lower in cities with an existing OSR system. Therefore, we suggest that the Chinese government consider the presence of existing railway networks when planning new HSR routes to maximize the efficiency of both railway systems. Moreover, we found the treatment effect of HSR on environmental efficiency to vary according to region, economic development, and population size. Specifically, we determined that cities in western China, with lower economic development or smaller population sizes, benefit more from HSR. These findings may suggest that policymakers could utilize HSR as a tool to promote balanced economic development.",1361-9209,Not found

This question is investigated using an endogenous growth model based on panel data that covers 11 cities in the GBA from 2000 to 2016. For the first time, the change in accessibility caused by both infrastructure development and the adjustment of custom policies were considered. In addition, impacts from the accessibility of various transportation modes (highway and rail) on different economic sectors were examined. The research findings confirm that the regional economy of the GBA is converged, which suggests that the regional economic disparity among the nine cities in the Guangdong province and the special administrative region of Hong Kong and Macau is reduced. In addition, the improvement of transportation accessibility was found to have a significant influence on regional economic growth, but the effects vary among different modes and economic sectors. In particular, the improved highway accessibility was found to have a positive effect on the regional growth of agriculture, construction, retail and hospitality. The effect of rail accessibility was found to be mixed, as a positive and significant effect was found on the sectors, such as agriculture, transportation, whereas the opposite effect was also confirmed in the manufacturing sector. Such a result suggests that the massive development of rail infrastructure system in GBA has facilitated economic restructuring to evolve from a manufacturing dominated system to a more balanced economic system. Overall, this study provides important implications for transportation planners and policymakers to improve their decision-making of future infrastructure investments pertaining to the improvement of transportation accessibility in GBA and beyond.",1361-9209,Not found

The introduction of electric vehicles seems to be a promising solution; however, the intensive use of such vehicles remains a challenge for economies. By using the two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method, this paper aims to provide useful insights to enlarge Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) market share. In the first stage, it calculates the efficiency scores for 20 European countries for both BEV adoption and policies supporting electric mobility, considering an output-oriented DEA method with constant returns to scale, and using annual data from 2010 to 2018. It is a non-parametric method, which makes it possible to determine the technical efficiency of the countries under study, i.e., the ability of these countries to transform their inputs into outputs. It calculates the efficiency frontier and determines if the countries are (or not) on this frontier. In the second stage, it examines the role of some determinants of electric mobility using the efficiency scores previously calculated by applying a fractional regression model. The main findings show that few countries are performing on the efficiency frontier. Additionally, renewable electricity generation increases a countries’ DEA score and contributes to bringing the inefficient countries closer to the efficiency frontier. Contrary, the existence of peak periods of electricity consumption decreases the DEA score and moves the inefficient countries further away from the frontier. This paper highlights the need to design transport and electricity policies jointly in order to ensure that the intensive use of BEV contributes towards renewables accommodation.",1361-9209,Not found

Roadway tunnels: A critical review of air pollutant concentrations and vehicular emissions,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102478,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Air quality is a widespread problem with the presence of pollutants in indoor and outdoor environments that generate significant consequences for the population, ecosystems and exposed materials. Vehicular traffic is one of the main sources of air pollutants and, therefore, needs to be studied and analysed in detail. This review reported the results of studies conducted on tunnels, in particular for the measurement of concentrations and the definition of emission factors. The characteristics of the tunnels, available ventilation systems, type of vehicular traffic, and geographical distribution, in addition to concentrations and emission factors, are discussed. Light-duty vehicles are the most frequent category in the case studies. Between the fuels used, gasoline is by far the most widespread. Pollutant concentrations concentrations can reach very high levels. For example, atmospheric particulates (with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 µm) and nitrogen dioxide have also reached levels of 1490 µg/m3 and 4982 µg/m3, respectively.",1361-9209,Not found
Eco-based pavement lifecycle maintenance scheduling optimization for equilibrated networks,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102471,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"This paper proposes a bi-level mathematical programming framework for pavement maintenance to minimize fuel consumption in equilibrated networks. The proposed model extends research in the area by formulating the interaction between network equilibrium and various maintenance activities. The volume of traffic, age of the pavement, initial conditions, and interference due to maintenance are considered in developing this long-term deterioration model. The fuel consumption induced by roughness and traffic disruption is further investigated in the optimization process. A modified active set algorithm with nested sub-programming is developed to generate the detailed solutions. The performance of the proposed model was tested by comparing it with two other mainstream strategies: worst first and threshold control. The results show that eco-based method outperformed prevalent models by reducing extra fuel consumption by 20%. They thus show that eco-based optimal scheduling has the potential to aid in long-term maintenance decisions and reduce the energy cost.",1361-9209,Not found
The diffusion of electric mobility in the European Union and beyond,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102462,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"This paper studies the diffusion process of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the European Union and beyond. Based on a logistic technology diffusion model, growth processes described by S-curves are predicted for a selction of 18 EU countries and five additional benchmark countries worldwide. This paper shows that for fixed upper bounds of the diffusion process, the investigated countries differ in terms of predicted diffusion speeds. Thus, the time for them to reach saturation in the number of adopters varies as well. In order to understand these different diffusion processes and their determinants, the factors influencing the diffusion speed in a subsample of 14 European countries are empirically analyzed. In addition to investigating country fixed effects and socio-economic factors, this paper focuses on government incentives and their impact on the diffusion rate. The paper reveals that financial incentives in the form of purchase price advantages do play an important role in this context. At the same time, the analysis does not confirm a significant impact of tax regulations and non-financial incentives on the diffusion speed.",1361-9209,Not found
Gender stereotypes affecting active mobility of care in Bogotá,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102470,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Urban cycling and mobility of care are in the spotlight of scholarly pursuits and policy agendas that promote sustainable and inclusive cities in the Global South. Recent research highlights the mobility of care as a differentiated type of mobility that mostly women execute. Additional literature focuses on the importance of improving health and environmental conditions through cycling. The connection between both bodies of literature has opened a space to consider how caregivers use the bicycle to perform their care duties. The Transport Gender Lab of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) financed a study focused on collecting data and developing a strategy to improve the safety conditions of cycling trips in which adults transport children to school. The study followed a mixed-methods approach that included focus groups and surveys in four districts of the city of Bogotá. Based on the data from that study, the main objective of this paper is to explore how entrenched gender stereotypes intersect with the mobility patterns of male and female cyclists who take children to school in the four districts. It focuses on three particular gender stereotypes: women’s characterization as main caregivers, men’s exercise of toxic masculinity, and women’s vulnerability in the public sphere. The paper further aims at providing policy recommendations for mobility planning with a gender perspective that can contribute to increase women's safety and usage of bicycles to take their kids to school.",1361-9209,Not found
Public charging infrastructure and the market diffusion of electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102413,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"A comprehensive roll-out of public charging infrastructure will be costly. However, its impact on the diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) is not clear. Our study aims at estimating the extent to which an increasing availability of public charging infrastructure promotes consumers decisions to switch to EVs. We make use of a German data set including monthly registrations of new cars at the ZIP-code level between 2012 and 2017 and match it with the official registry of charging stations. We measure charging infrastructure by its quantity, capacity and abundance in order to estimate its impact on EV adoption. A dynamic heterogeneous panel approach is deployed in order to identify the structural long-run relationship between charging infrastructure and monthly EV registrations. We find evidence of a positive long-run relationship (and also of a causal link) but on a rather low scale. We conclude that consumers do not necessarily react to the mere number of public chargers but attach more importance to charging speed and are to a large extent influenced by unobservable common factors.",1361-9209,Not found
Effects of transportation infrastructure on fishes in the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102451,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Rivers worldwide are fragmented by transportation infrastructure that blocks the movements of aquatic organisms. To assess the effects of road culverts on stream fishes in the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains regions of Oklahoma, we surveyed 39 free-flowing sites, 29 sites upstream and 29 sites downstream of culverts. We observed differences in species richness and abundance between free-flowing sites, sites upstream of a culvert, and downstream sites. We also found that the degree to which a culvert affected richness and abundance depended on culvert type and length. Furthermore, the culverts in the poorest condition had the greatest effects on abundance and richness. Replacement of these poor condition culverts is likely a high priority for both conservation groups and infrastructure agencies. Our findings enable conservation practitioners to identify structures that may be high priorities for aquatic organism passage projects, including those that may benefit from cost-sharing or collaboration with infrastructure agencies.",1361-9209,Not found
Hybrid operations of human driving vehicles and automated vehicles with data-driven agent-based simulation,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102469,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Automated vehicles (AVs) receive tremendous attention and achieve rapid development. It is foreseeable that hybrid operations of human driving vehicles and automated vehicles in the urban transportation environment will be a long-standing state. To investigate the influence of AVs on the hybrid ride-hailing market, data-driven agent-based modeling and simulation (D2ABMS) for large-scale transportation networks is proposed, in which human drivers, automated vehicles, and passengers form three types of agents. D2ABMS goes beyond existing approaches by employing data-driven multi-objective deep learning to learn ride-sourcing drivers' offline/online behavior. E mbedding is used to represent the hidden attributes of different classes of drivers. Ride-sourcing data collected from the city of Hangzhou, China, are used to train and validate the drivers' decision-making model. Hybrid operations of human driving vehicles and automated vehicles with D2ABMS are comprehensively tested in various scenarios. The results show that a small proportion of automated vehicles in the hybrid ride-hailing market can significantly reduce the average waiting time of passengers. Besides, compared to the human driving scenario, the total exhaust emissions and vehicle kilometers traveled can be reduced by 12.3% in the AVs scenario. The proposed D2ABMS system has the potential to help transportation planners and ride-hailing platforms to assess their policies and operations management strategies in the era of shared mobility and automated vehicles.",1361-9209,Not found
The climate change mitigation potential of sugarcane based technologies for automobiles; CO<inf>2</inf> negative emissions in sight,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102454,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Continuous effort to mitigate climate change relies onnew technologies able to satisfy human demand for energy services with high energy efficiency andreasonable costs. We show that blending a well-known technology with recently introduced and proven technical advances can mitigate climate change in the road transport sector. Furthermore, the achievement of a reasonable cost target is proved to be true when internal combustion engines (ICE) light duty vehicles (LDVs), powered by gasoline fuel, are replaced by plug-in hybrid LDVs (PHEV), powered by ethanol and electricity produced from sugarcane, using well established technology. The only improvements in such ethanol producing technology are the addition of woody biomass to extend the operation of sugar mills and the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) generated during sugar fermentation into ethanol. Both actions are already adopted and well developed. The study quantifies greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions and the present value cost for operation of a global fleet of 1 billion LDV over a 60-year period. The PHEV powered by sugar cane products reduces GHGs emissions partly through negative emissions, at a lower cost than gasoline fueled ICE vehicles or electric vehicles. Total potential GHG emission reduction is significant but lower than what is required for the transport sector to fulfill international commitments. Nevertheless, if 1 billion sugarcane-based PHEV hit the streets by the year 2060, 6.18 Gt CO2e/year can be avoided while the necessity of land for biomass plantation is kept at a reasonable value (86 Mha).",1361-9209,Not found

This study aims to identify the determinants of ship operators’ decisions by applying descriptive statistics and a multinomial logistic regression based on the data obtained from the Clarkson World Fleet Register database. The analysis provides the following key results: First, scrubbers and LNG are more attractive compliance choices for new vessels, while older vessels’ operators prefer low-sulfur fuels. Second, less compliant vessels are more likely to switch to low-sulfur fuels to comply with the regulation.

In international shipping, transportation researchers have pointed out that reduced waiting time in association with port calls holds such promise. We explore the potential for GHG abatement through port call optimization, focusing on crews and their employers - the shipping companies. Adding new empirical evidence to the transportation literature, we confirm the existence of idle time during port calls, and go beyond this in describing the causes for it. We show how several port stakeholders, including government officials, limit the crews’ and shipping companies’ room for maneuver in relation to port calls. We also show why the process of reducing waiting time in shipping is more complex than that for onshore transport modes, where real-time traffic information guides drivers’ route choices, and reduces congestion and waiting time.

Firstly, the economic radius of RAP stockpile logistic centers was calculated to determine the optimal number of RAP stockpile logistic centers according to the density of road network in the target region. Then, the proper location of each RAP stockpile logistic center was investigated employing ArcGIS buffer analysis and Floyd algorithm, with three factors taken into consideration (environment impacts, RAP material yield and consumption of each road in highway network, and the economic transport distance). Finally, upon the selection of each RAP stockpile logistic center site, the economic benefits were evaluated through cost-benefit analysis (CBA). In a case study based on the data of Jiangsu province expressway network, it suggested that an establishment of 13 RAP stockpile logistic centers will meet the recycling maintenance need of asphalt pavement over the whole highway network in Jiangsu province, contributing to a 6-year net maintenance benefit of about 70 million CNY.",1361-9209,Not found
Can we evacuate from hurricanes with electric vehicles?,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102458,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The increasing usage of electrical vehicles (EVs) might not meet the safety requirement of massive hurricane evacuations, which may happen more frequently in the future climate.

We find that, if the majority of the evacuating vehicles were EVs, Florida would face a serious challenge in power supply, with its six out of nine main power authorities, especially those in the mid-Florida, being short of power during the evacuation process. Also, the power outage in mid-Florida could induce cascading failure of the entire power network throughout Florida. We argue that policymakers need to consider the evacuation problem as EVs are increasingly adopted in disaster-prone regions. Potential solutions include developing centralized charging strategies, improving battery technology, and adopting hybrid vehicles in addition to EVs.",1361-9209,Not found

We show that there are clear inequalities across cohorts in the distribution of benefits that the transit system provides as measured by the number of reachable valued destinations. The results indicate that areas of low accessibility have a higher percentage of African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, low-income workers, low-educated citizens, and the elderly. The most affected cohort are low-income workers, for whom access to jobs, parks, groceries, hospitals, and libraries decline as their number grows. The findings also highlight that inequities are most severe, in order, to jobs, hospitals, and grocery stores when examining the different cohorts.

The accessibility of urban neighborhoods when buildings collapse due to an earthquake,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102439,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Local or neighborhood roads form the bulk of urban road network and are responsible for the last mile connectivity. They are highly vulnerable to earthquake-like hazards, causing road closures of magnitude ranging from small traffic diversions to isolation of entire neighborhoods. Such disruptions impede the emergency response, and significantly affect the post-disaster recovery. Hence their design, construction, and maintenance are of utmost importance for efficient working of transportation systems. In this article, we study the accessibility of local roads based on intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of vulnerability with a focus on Indian cities. The methodology divides the road network into two components. The first one is the inaccessible stretch of the road network due to its width (Intrinsic Vulnerability), and the second one is the accessible stretch of the road network prone to road closures due to collapsed buildings (Extrinsic vulnerability). Then a three-step framework, namely road network inventory development, building vulnerability assessment, and road closure analysis, is proposed for vulnerability assessment. For this purpose, 77 km of road network and 612 buildings are studied in three selected wards of Siliguri Municipal Corporation (Seismic zone IV). A comparative analysis between the wards for the change in accessibility levels before and after an earthquake is done. The results are measures of inaccessibility in the road network, which are also visualized as isolated streets on the maps.

Electric light commercial vehicles: Are they the sleeping giant of electromobility?,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102421,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Transport emissions need to be drastically decreased in order to put Europe on a path towards a long-term climate neutrality. Commercial transport, and especially last mile delivery is expected to grow because of the rise of e-commerce. In this frame, electric light commercial vehicles (eLCVs) can be a promising low-emission solution. Literature holistically analysing the potential of eLCVs as well as related support policies is sparse. This paper attempts to close this research gap. To this aim, the total cost of ownership (TCO) comparisons for eLCVs and benchmark vehicles are performed and support measures that target the improvement of the eLCV TCO are analysed. Various eLCV deployment scenarios until 2030 are explored and their impact on carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutant emissions as well as pollutant concentrations are calculated. It is found that while in several European Union (EU) countries eLCVs are already cost competitive, because of fiscal support, some remaining market barriers need to be overcome to pave the way to mass market deployment of eLCVs. High penetration of eLCVs alone can lead to a reduction of total transport CO2 emissions by more than 3% by 2030. For pollutant emissions, such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), the reduction would be equal or even higher. In the case of PM, this can translate to reductions in concentrations by nearly 2% in several urban areas by 2030. Carefully designed support policies could help to ensure that the potential of eLCVs as a low-emission alternative is fully leveraged in the EU.",1361-9209,Not found

Assessing the impact of cornering losses on the energy consumption of electric city buses,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102360,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"In view of the increasing electrification of public city transport, an accurate energy consumption prediction for Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) is essential. Conventional prediction algorithms do not consider energy losses that occur during turning of the vehicle. This is especially relevant for electric city buses, which have a limited battery capacity and often drive curvy routes. In this paper, the additional energy consumption during steering of a BEB is modeled, measured, and assessed. A nonlinear steady-state cornering model is developed to establish the additional energy losses during cornering. The model includes large steer angles, load transfer, and a Magic Formula tire model. Model results show that both cornering resistance and tire scrub of the rear tires cause additional energy losses during cornering, depending on the corner radius and vehicle velocity. The energy consumption model is validated with full scale vehicle tests and shows an average deviation of 0.8kW compared to the measurements. Analysis of recorded real-world bus routes reveals that on average these effects constitute 3.1% of the total powertrain energy. The effect is even more significant for routes crossing city centers, reaching values up to 5.8%. In these cases, cornering losses can be significant and should not be neglected in an accurate energy consumption prediction.",1361-9209,Not found
Minimizing network-wide emissions by optimal routing through inner-city gating,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102411,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"In this paper, we propose a control and optimization framework to reduce network-wide emissions in an urban traffic network. The framework is comprised of two layers. The first layer (optimal green routing) predicts the optimal splitting coefficients for all Origin–Destination (OD) pairs crossing the city center or bypassing. As implementing optimal routing strategies on the field is almost impossible as we do not have direct control over the user’s decisions, we choose to balance travel time through gating at the city perimeter so that the usual Dynamic User Equilibrium (DUE) discipline matches the optimal splitting coefficients. The second layer then adjusts inflows at the city gates to the DUE solution based on the instantaneous travel times corresponding to the optimal routing strategy for each OD pair. The accumulation-based Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) model of a single reservoir city with seven arterial routes and six bypass alternatives is developed. A Linear programming problem is formulated to determine the optimal splitting coefficients and a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)-based gating control strategy is designed to track the optimal splitting coefficients. The network-wide emission control framework is compared to three other gating strategies aiming to (i) optimize traffic conditions or (ii) minimize emissions, in the inner-city only, and (iii) optimize traffic conditions in the whole network. A comprehensive analysis conducted on all four approaches is presented. We compare the results of the controlled case with respect to the uncontrolled case and with respect to each other.

Promote transit via hardening first-and-last-mile accessibility: Learned from modeling commuters’ transit use,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102446,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"To understand how transit ridership would be increased via hardening first-and-last mile (F&LM) connections, the paper explores a quantity-based method to measure the effect of F&LM access when estimating workers’ commuting transit use in Hamilton County, Ohio. Considering variations in the spatial distribution of socioeconomics, built environment, and transportation services, a geographically weighted lasso (GWL) based structure is applied in modeling transit use so as to capture spatial heterogeneous role of F&LM access and to deal with local variable multicollinearity. In the GWL model, transit use is formulated as a function of transit service coverage, job accessibility by transit, and other socioeconomic, built environment, and transportation variables. The transit service coverage is articulated with choices of different F&LM modes (i.e., walking and biking), F&LM network connectivity to transit, and land use density; and job accessibility by transit is measured using the number of destination jobs covered by transit and transit journey time to destinations. The GWL modeling results suggest that a 10% growth in population covered by transit and job accessibility by transit can increase transit usage by 5.9% and 6.6% respectively, especially attracting more riders in the urban fringe. Then, the effectiveness of policy interventions such as dense development, promotion of bike usage, and increased bike connectivity in increasing transit ridership are subsequently estimated. Additionally, results indicate that providing improved F&LM access to car-less population, minority, and low-income people who tend to rely more on transit than others is more effective in promoting transit use.",1361-9209,Not found

Results show that local accessibility measures such as retail and service density and job density play a more critical role in predicting auto ownership than transit access, while regional access to city centers is the least important. Thus, for reducing car ownership, planning efforts should emphasize improving local accessibility through planning pedestrian-scale neighborhoods (i.e., life-circles). Moreover, nonlinear associations between accessibility measures and car ownership are common. The results suggest that within the 15-min neighborhood life circle, there should be 65–145 retail and service facilities per km2 and block size should be within 150–200 m. Furthermore, residential neighborhoods should be within 400 m of bus stops and 1200 m of metro stations.

The majority of EU effort towards reducing emissions is aimed at vehicle manufacturers, mandating development of more efficient engines in order to reduce emissions. We propose a complementary approach to help reach the EU goals. Due to the need for motorists to repeatedly stop and accelerate while driving in urban areas, overall emission rates are observed to be higher in these environments than on open motorways. As a result, management algorithms that focus on harmonising the flow of traffic in urban centres have the potential to greatly reduce urban emission rates. In this paper, we propose a set of functionalities in form of ”use cases” in order to illustrate the inefficiencies of urban traffic flow by utilising cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. The major contribution of this paper is in addressing the potential positive impact of such measures.

The analysis and evaluation of the RDE test results reveal that the cold-start emissions account for a significant proportion of the urban trip emissions, and that the moving average window (MAW) method is not suitable for statistically processing the RDE test data that include the cold-start emission data. Additionally, three on-road emission tests including a cold-start test and two hot-start tests at different vehicle thermal states were designed to evaluate the effect of the initial vehicle thermal state on the vehicle start emissions. The results demonstrate that the thermal state of the TWC converter thermal state has a more direct and important effect on the cold-start emissions in the RDE test. Via a comparative analysis of the instantaneous characteristics of pollutant emission rates, fuel–air equivalent ratios, catalytic converter temperatures, vehicle trip dynamic parameters, etc., it is inferred that driving behavior has a more significant and sensitive impact on the cold-start emissions than on the non-cold-start emissions in the RDE test. Based on the RDE tests performed at different ambient temperatures, it is also indicated that the impact of the ambient temperature on the cold-start emissions is only a secondary factor relative to driving behavior. As a result, the trip dynamic conditions, specifically those for the cold-start period, should be set more reasonably and effectively in future RDE regulations to ensure the consistency of the cold-start emission test results.",1361-9209,Not found

Applying this method, it was found that regional fuel economy varies due to differences in driving patterns alone and that rural driving patterns lead to improved fuel economy (for conventional vehicles). The driving cycles and regional weighting factors described here are useful for testing and simulation studies, specifically those sensitive to regional variations in driving patterns.",1361-9209,Not found
Influence of roadway emissions on near-road PM<inf>2.5</inf>: Monitoring data analysis and implications,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102442,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Transportation projects must undergo a transportation conformity hot-spot analysis if they are designated as projects of local air quality concern (POAQC). We examined particulate matter 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter or smaller (PM2.5) concentrations measured in 2017 from 48 near-road monitoring sites across the U.S. Annual average PM2.5 increments, the difference between near-road and background PM2.5, were between 0.1 ± 0.2 µg/m3 and 2.0 ± 0.2 µg/m3 for sites without noted confounding factor(s). The highest PM2.5 increment from monitors 10 or more meters from the roadway was 1.4 ± 0.2 µg/m3. Using modeled national average exhaust emissions, and associated near-road contribution to PM2.5, the upper bound of2.0 ± 0.2 µg/m3 isprojected to decrease 30% from 2017 to2040, for the types of highways assessed here, assuming a roadway with 8% heavy-duty vehicles and constant traffic volumes.

Low-carbon travel mode choices: The role of time perceptions and familiarity,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102378,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Academic studies and recent social movements alike highlight the importance of changing flying behavior for reaching global climate goals. A particularly effective strategy for minimizing transport-related CO2 emissions is to substitute flights with train travel. The same trip causes around 80–90% less CO2 emissions by train than by plane. The results of this paper are based on two independent samples, the first representing the Swiss population, the second one including international business students. Both empirical studies consistently show that respondents who are familiar with train travel are also more prone to consider the train as an alternative for international, long-distance trips. Furthermore, both studies find systematic differences when it comes to travel time perceptions of likely air and train travelers: While people who are inclined to travel by plane see a high value in minimizing the total travel time of their journey, likely train travelers put less emphasis on minimizing total travel time. At the same time, prospective train travelers find it highly important to be able to use their travel time productively, which does not seem to be the case for potential air travelers. As consumer insights about the willingness to substitute flying with train travel are rare, the results of this paper build a basis for developing communication strategies and policies aiming at increasing low-carbon travel mode choices.",1361-9209,Not found
Spatial associations of dockless shared e-scooter usage,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102396,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"In this study, we explore the usage of e-scooter sharing services in Austin, Texas over about a six-month period. The study is based on trip records of all the shared e-scooter operators in Austin and includes trip start and end locations. We use both analysis of trip patterns and spatial regression techniques to examine how the built environment, land use, and demographics affect e-scooter trip generation. Our findings show that people use e-scooters almost exclusively in central Austin. Commuting does not seem to be the main trip purpose, and usage of e-scooters is associated with areas with high employment rates, and in areas with bicycle infrastructure. People use e-scooter sharing regardless of the affluence of the neighborhood, although less affluent areas with high usage rates have large student populations, suggesting that students use this mode of travel. Implications for planners suggest that better bicycle infrastructure will facilitate e-scooter usage, college towns are a ready market for e-scooter sharing services, and e-scooters may be a substitute for some short non-work trips, reducing car usage, and benefiting the environment.",1361-9209,Not found
Examining the effects of neighbourhood design on walking in growing megacity,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102417,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"It is widely believed that neighbourhood design can play a role in promoting walking. However, when personal attitudes and preferences as well as different types of walking are taken into account, research conclusions are still mixed. This paper provides new evidence by looking at the case of Beijing. Three types of walking were investigated: commuting walking, living walking, and recreational walking. By analysing the data from 3748 questionnaires based on the conceptual framework of the TPB model, we found that walking behaviour is significantly related to neighbourhood design, as well as personal attitudes and preferences. High density, land use diversity, and walking-friendly street design can encourage walking. Those who have positive attitudes towards walking or residential preferences for walkable environments walked more, although these effects varied among commuting walking, living walking, and recreational walking. Walking for transportation, especially commuting walking, was less correlated with neighbourhood design elements.",1361-9209,Not found
Evaluating alternative energy carriers in ferry transportation using a stochastic multi-criteria decision analysis approach,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102383,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"As part of ship acquisition decision making, owners and key stakeholders need to evaluate ship design and technology solutions across economic and environmental criteria in addition to safety and other regulatory requirements. Changes in technology, market, fiscal and other regulatory conditions may furthermore significantly influence value retention over the investment period. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) provides structure and clarity in otherwise complex decision problems, allowing decision makers to identify promising courses of action in a holistic manner. Combined with stochastic evaluation techniques, MCDM may facilitate problem exploration and learning in situations where outcomes are uncertain. In this article, we combine two variants of “Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis” (SMAA) with “Technique for Ordering of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution” (TOPSIS) to evaluate the use of biofuels, natural gas and electricity on Norwegian ferry crossings. We analyze uncertain criteria values for environmental impacts, costs, fuel access and public acceptance across seven ferry combinations for a crossing. Criteria weighting is performed deterministically and stochastically to extract and interpret the conditions under which alternatives perform well or poorly. The case study shows that all-electric propulsion is preferable, while plug-in hybrid solutions with natural gas also give a robust performance. The approach is beneficial in handling multiple, uncertain performance metrics and provides a transparent and holistic foundation for evaluating marine emission reduction technology options in ship acquisition decision contexts.",1361-9209,Not found
Lack of resilience in transportation networks: Economic implications,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102419,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Disruptions to transportation networks are inevitable. When road networks are not resilient, or in other words, do not recover rapidly from disruptions, unpredictable events can cause significant delays that may be disproportionately greater than the extent of the disruption. Enhancing transportation system resilience can help mitigate the consequences of disruptions; however, required investments are difficult to justify given the low probability of such events. This paper calculates economic implications of unmitigated random disruptions in urban road systems. We modeled delays in transportation networks and demonstrated how resilience can be integrated into macroeconomic modeling via the transportation planning model, REMI TranSight. The model was applied to 10 cities in the United States to forecast the impact of disruptions on gross domestic product (GDP). Different disruption scenarios were modeled and the magnitude of disruption was used to calculate additional delays in transportation networks, which were then integrated into the TranSight model. The results were compared to a baseline case, where economic impact was assumed to be proportional to the magnitude of disruptions. Results show that losses in GDP were far more pronounced in the case scenario as compared to the baseline. The losses tended to be higher in wealthier and more economically productive cities. The economic output tends to rebound one to two years after a disruptive event. We conclude that different topology in transportation networks in different cities requires explicit consideration and quantification of resilience to support investment decisions designed to improve transportation networks in cities.",1361-9209,Not found
Planning car-lite neighborhoods: Examining long-term impacts of accessibility boosts on vehicle ownership,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102394,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"Transformative technologies like automated vehicles, and emerging services like mobility-on-demand and ride-sharing, are changing the ecosystem of urban mobility. Land use-transport interaction (LUTI) models provide appropriate platforms to test the impacts of such services on cities. Although these services are purported to have mixed effects on cities, there is a general consensus that these services will increase accessibility. We approach the ‘car-lite’ policy through this lens of increased accessibility, and base this study in the city-state of Singapore. Different study areas are chosen in a manner similar to the differences-in-differences approach, in order to tease out the effects of initial neighborhood vacancy rate, vehicle-free behavior, and tight markets on policy impacts. We also design different scenarios that represent varying market reactions to the policy, and compare them to a baseline where the car-lite policy is never implemented. Study areas that are initially less ‘tight’ (i.e., have higher vacancy rates and lower vehicle-free rates) are found to have significantly larger transitions to vehicle-free behavior. Additionally, our finding of accessibility-induced gentrification speaks to the importance of considering the endogeneity in housing and mobility choices while formulating policies that may seemingly feel relevant only to the transportation realm. Providing appropriate mixes of housing typologies with adequate affordable housing, in addition to restricting car use for higher-income car-owning households, are suggested as strategies for designing car-lite neighborhoods.",1361-9209,Not found
Understanding cycling travel distance: The case of Medellin city (Colombia),10.1016/j.trd.2020.102423,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"The relevance of cycling as a mode of transportation is increasingly being recognized in many cities around the world, and the city of Medellin (Colombia) is no exception. To better understand cycling travel behavior in Medellin, we perform a multiple regression to analyze the importance of route characteristics in explaining cycling travel distance. We control for socioeconomic and built environment variables at the origin and destination. Our results reveal that the effects of the socio-economic and built environment characteristics at the origin and destination are modest or statistically insignificant in explaining travel distance. However, the variables that characterize the built and natural environment along the route are significant and appreciably improve the explanatory power of the baseline econometric model. An analysis of interacting effects shows that the interaction between the dedicated infrastructure along the route and the degree of deviation from direct routes has a relevant effect on explaining travel distance.

Evaluating impacts of intelligent transit priority on intersection energy and emissions,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102416,86,2020-09-01,2020,9,"A signal priority strategy (SPS) is implemented to encourage the development of public transportation, but this strategy may delay other vehicles to produce more emissions, especially at intersection. This study aims to develop an intersection energy consumption and emissions model framework with an embedded SPS to analyse the impacts of the SPS on the intersection. To validate this model framework, an intersection in Shenzhen, China was selected for simulation as a case study. In this study, we compared the effects of an active SPS, a real-time SPS and the real-time SPS improved under Intelligent Vehicle Infrastructure Cooperation System (i-VICS) on the energy consumption and emissions of the targeted intersection. The simulation results illustrate that, the active strategy could decrease fuel consumption and emissions with a maximum reduction of 13.33% in fuel consumption, and the real-time strategy maintains a smooth fluctuation in the total fuel consumption and emissions during the entire period. Compared with the two in-use strategies, the i-VICS-based transit priority strategy demonstrates the best environmental performance, by reducing the greatest negative environmental influences and cutting down the most emissions of nearly 28.86% in the case study. The developed intersection energy consumption and emissions model framework can be applied to evaluation of different SPSs on the environment respect, which can benefit to urban transportation management in a more sustainable way.",1361-9209,Not found

Since EV is considered as an environment-friendly vehicle with lower cost of operation, many studies have paid attention to the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission evaluation on EVs. This study aims to expand the scope and provide comprehensive results for LCC and GHG emission comparison between ICEV and EV under different driving cycles, which refer to the driving patterns and parameters such as velocity and acceleration changed by years. The charging infrastructure and battery pilot use have also been involved in the evaluation. Results show that the LCC of an EV is about 9% higher than that of an ICEV under the driving cycle in Beijing in 2020. At the same time, the life cycle GHG emissions of an EV are about 29% lower than those of an ICEV. If the lifetime mileage is not as long as expected, the gap of LCC would be larger and the gap of GHG emissions would be smaller. Recycling is very effective in reducing the GHG emissions but does not work for LCC reduction. Battery pilot use has large potentials on LCC reduction but it still needs time to realize. In this scenario without battery pilot use, the cost effectiveness of an EV is about 4 kg CO2eq/$.",1361-9209,Not found

In this paper we investigate the introduction of ride-hailing services on pollution in the largest developing economy in the world, China. We use a difference-in-difference approach to longitudinally examine cities that introduced the Didi Chuxing service. Our results suggest that the announcement of the ride-hailing service led to a decrease in PM2.5 pollution in the month before service launch and in the early months of its introduction. However, this effect is temporary, as the growth in ride-hailing vehicles and a rapid increase in the number of overall trips gives way to an increase in vehicle pollution in this underdeveloped market.

With this model we go beyond the market penetration studies for EVs, as it brings together both car choice and transport patterns with mode choice for a set of heterogeneous representative model agents. We illustrate the possible effects of current policies on congestion, CO2 emissions and other urban transport externalities, public transport use and crowding, tax revenues and welfare. On this basis, we explore other road toll, public transport fare and tax policies that can lead to better outcomes for the Oslo transport market while still respecting the CO2-cap that reflects the goals of Norwegian policy makers.",1361-9209,Not found

A challenge with many studies is that they are either retrospective or cross-sectional, thus giving little control over confounding factors. We followed up a short term trial where quite large mode change had been observed among participants. In the present study we conducted a before after-study with a customer group who bought an e-bike (N = 39) and a comparison group wanting to buy one (N = 142) using a survey with a travel diary to capture changes in travel behaviour. We also used a broader comparison group (N = 767) to test the robustness of the results from a policy perspective. The measurement period lasted up to six months. We found that people who purchased an e-bike increased their bicycle use from 2.1 to 9.2 km per day on average, representing a change in bike as share of all transport from 17 to 49 percent. The comparison group had negligible changes in cycling during the same time period, and the choice of comparison group had a very marginal effect on the results. The results show that the large change in cycling we previously found of a trial scheme with e-bikes is replicated with actual customers. The change in cycling share is somewhat larger than it was for the short-term users, showing that mode change from e-bikes is not just a novelty effect.",1361-9209,Not found

Our model considers bothhydrodynamic and trafficeffects. The results show that the relocation of commercial and residential buildings from inundated to dry areas will increase congestion levels, while preventive protection of the shoreline leads to lower levels of traffic congestion.

In both contexts, men in relatively poor households without motor vehicles are likeliest to cycle. The similarities in cycling commuters generally stop with these commonalities, however. The archetypal US bike commuter is a recent college graduate, lives by himself in a centrally located apartment in a moderate-to- high density city, like Portland, OR, and works in a relatively low-paying service sector job, perhaps at a restaurant or a not-for-profit. The archetypal Mexican bike commuter, by contrast, is in his mid-forties, has only a few years of formal education, lives with a large family in a house in the suburbs of either a small city or a dense metropolitan area, and commutes to a relatively low-paying agriculture, construction, or manufacturing job. Local context matters and the most effective public policies to promote urban cycling will almost certainly vary across national borders. For example, our analysis suggests that suburban cycling investments will likely do a lot more to support Mexican cyclists than US ones. Last, we conclude that there is a need for studies that include comparable measures of cycling infrastructure, local built environments, and non-work trips across national contexts.",1361-9209,Not found

For this assessment, we enhance the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model to represent the fleet dynamics of light-duty vehicles (LDV), including internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and EVs. For EV fleet, both plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) are considered. We consider several illustrative scenarios and find that global LDV stock is projected to grow from 1.1 billion vehicles in 2015 to 1.65–1.75 billion in 2050, while global EV stock is growing from about a million in 2015 to about 585–825 million in 2050. At this level of market penetration, EVs would constitute one-third to one-half of the overall LDV fleet by 2050 in different scenarios, with the stricter carbon constraints implied in the Paris to 2 °C scenario leading to the largest EV share. Our modeling suggests that EV uptake will vary across regions. China, the U.S., and Europe remain the largest markets in our study timeframe, but the EV presence is projected to grow in all regions. While the global LDV fleet grows by about 50% by 2050, the corresponding CO2 emissions from LDV are reduced by about 50% in 2050 relative to 2015.

One of the vehicles was instrumented with a gas flow meter, which measured the gas consumption, and a smartphone based data logger, which collected data from the truck’s Fleet Management System (FMS) interface. Similarly, a baseline diesel truck was instrumented. Based on the measurements that were collected in-service, fuel consumption models were developed and validated. Using the validated models, the CG and diesel trucks were compared for their transport performance, costs and carbon emissions. In addition, the vehicles were evaluated using telematics data and refuelling data from a year of transport operations for all 41 CG trucks and 9 diesel trucks. The results show that for a tonne.km of in-service (mostly long haul) transport work, compared to the diesel trucks, the CG trucks spend on average 22% more energy and their fuel cost is 30% lower for biomethane. When running on CNG, their equivalent carbon emissions is 10% lower than the baseline diesel, and when running on biomethane, their equivalent carbon emissions is 78% lower.

To consider indirect emissions and potentially additional battery degradation due to V2G, a model coupling concept is applied to link Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with the electricity system model, PERSEUS-EU.

To this end, it uses mixed logit model on the choice scenario data to elicit the behavioral responses. Governmental incentives such as free public parking and free public transport significantly impact the preferences for HFCVs. In terms of socio-demographic characteristics, education and apartment parking remarkably affect the adoption of HFCVs.

The relative sustainability of these services depends on their ability to successfully match riders for pooled trips. Accordingly, this paper examines the matching propensity of shared ride-hailing services and explores the detour penalty associated with pooling, as this impacts the uptake and viability of shared services. Using a 12-million record dataset of every ride-hailing trip conducted in Toronto between September 2016 and March 2017, we determine that 15% of ride-hailing trips were pooled, but that only 52% of these were actually matched. A probit model reveals that higher demand and longer trip distances significantly improve matching propensity. We also examine the detour penalty associated with pooling and find that successfully matched shared ride-hailing trips only took 3.6 minutes longer, on average, than comparable non-shared trips. Our findings imply that reducing the detour time associated with pooling to attract more riders may ultimately increase the likelihood that shared trips go unmatched, negating the sustainability benefits of the service.",1361-9209,Not found

This study thoroughly investigates the cold chain mode choice problem by selecting shipping mode (containerized transport and bulk transport) for each shipment and determining shipment quantities and ship deployment in a multi-period planning environment with independent perishable product demands. Value-Based Management as a novel method in shipping is adopted to consider both economic and environmental objectives from operational and financial aspects. The value-based mode selection models also determine the sailing speed of the heterogeneous chartered reefer bulk fleet under different chartering terms. Furthermore, the paper evaluates greenhouse gas emissions from the cold chain shipping. Findings from a numerical example show that optimal ship speed decreases with a reducing rate when the bunker price increases and with a higher decline rate when goods are less perishable.",1361-9209,Not found
Measuring the effects of job competition and matching on employment accessibility,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102535,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Accessibility has often been seen as a key indicator to assess socio-economic interactions and planning policies involving urban transportation and land use. Job competition and matching are important factors for individual job seekers as they evaluate job prospects, often including employment accessibility. However, due to inadequate data and the complex representation and interpretation of methods used, many studies have not considered job competition and matching as they attempted to assess employment accessibility. Most of the available studies do not analyze the effects of economic status, educational background, and transportation mode. In the small number of studies addressing job competition, few have considered the combination of multi-modal transportation access for commuters, though these are available in large metropolitan areas. In order to gain a better understanding of employment accessibility, this study adopts a method to assess employment accessibility by incorporating job proximity, job competition, and job matching in a multi-modal transportation system. This study focuses on the eight-county Greater Houston metropolitan region. Unemployed workers in the civilian labor force are a proxy for the number of job seekers. It is used to calculate employment accessibilities for job seekers in poverty, with different educational backgrounds, and commuting via multiple transportation modes. An interesting finding is that household auto ownership is an important determinant not only for auto drivers, but also for transit riders engaged in job seeking. In an automobile-oriented city such as Houston, driving to bus stops or rail transit stations provides job seekers significant advantages over walk-to-transit riders, especially for those living in suburban areas outside the boundary of the existing transit systems serving the central city or the core county.",1361-9209,Not found
Exploration of roadway factors and habitat quality using InVEST,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102551,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Roadways vary in structural, geotechnical, locational, and operational properties, and synergies among these factors may present overwhelming challenges to understanding their full effects on the habitat quality (HQ). To explore the impact of dense roadway networks on an ecologically fragile region in the northwest of China, this study applied the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) to evaluate the HQ spatiotemporal distribution of the study area. Then, Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) were formulated to examine the cumulative impact due to the operation of an increasing amount of roadways over the past two decades. According to the results, the influence of different road types on the HQ was apparent within the road-effect zone, and road grading reduction, road length and operation duration increase can harm the HQ within the road-effect zone.

Capturing the impact of individual characteristics on transport accessibility and equity analysis,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102473,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Transport accessibility experienced by an individual depends on their needs and abilities, as represented by their individual characteristics, such as age, income and gender. Although important from an equity perspective, the individual component of accessibility is currently ignored in most transport equity studies. This paper evaluates the impact of including individual characteristics into logsum-based accessibility measures for transport equity analysis. Using data from the London Travel Demand Survey (LTDS) 2011–13, two alternate logsum measures of accessibility are specified – with and without individual characteristics. An empirical analysis of spatial, social and economic equity is conducted using both the measures, and the outcomes are compared. The results clearly demonstrate that ignoring individual characteristics in logsum measures of accessibility can lead to unreliable outcomes for social and economic equity analysis, but do not add significant value when aggregated across large geographical zones for spatial equity analysis. Overall, ignoring individual characteristics masks the disparity in distribution of accessibility, as measured by the Gini index. Although not straightforward, the difference between accessibility patterns using the two logsum measures also yields insights into the possible causes of inequity, which can provide actionable inputs to policy makers. The study highlights that personal needs and abilities are often responsible for accessibility variations among individuals and ignoring them can result in a misleading picture of equity, as demonstrated quantitatively in this paper.",1361-9209,Not found
"How do the perceptions of neighborhood conditions impact active transportation? A study in Rajshahi, Bangladesh",10.1016/j.trd.2020.102525,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This paper aims to investigate the perceptions of neighborhood conditions and their effect on urban active transportation (UAT) in the context of a city in the Global South. We analyze data from a survey of commuters in the city of Rajshahi, Bangladesh. Concretely, we are interested in cycling and walking. A probabilistic model of mode use is estimated using disaggregate data collected in Rajshahi through a face-to-face survey in 2017. The study reveals that similar to other regions in the world, students are more likely to use active transportation compared to other socio-demographic groups, and that motorized vehicle ownership is associated with lower probabilities of active transportation. Furthermore, the probabilities of choosing active modes at different neighborhood-level conditions were calculated based on the derived model for both students and non-students by residential and non-residential land-use types. In addition to the duration of the trip, the perceived neighborhood-level characteristics are critical for active transportation. Improving neighborhood conditions and their perception by the public can enhance the attractiveness of active travel, more specifically cycling for longer commutes. Based on the study findings, the paper discusses strategies to promote the use of active transportation in the context of a country in the Global South.",1361-9209,Not found
Impact of topology and congestion on link criticality rankings in transportation networks,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102529,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Due to the lack of ground truth on the link criticality rankings of transportation networks, it is not possible to identify the most accurate metric. While several studies provide reviews of the existing criticality metrics, the consistencies of calculated rankings by these metrics are yet to be explored. In this paper, link criticality rankings with five different metrics are compared under 150 test networks of different network topologies and congestion levels. Accordingly, the consensus metric that provides a ranking that is closest to the aggregate ranking is identified for each test network. The results show transportation network efficiency metric is the most frequent consensus metric and link flow can serve as proxy for criticality analysis under certain network characteristics. The level of congestion and network transitivity are the most important features to determine the consensus metric. The proposed framework is then tested on Sioux Falls, Eastern Massachusetts, and Anaheim networks.",1361-9209,Not found

Using Tokyo as a case study, we develop a node-place-ridership model to evaluate coordination between these three facets and compare different transit operators, namely subway in central area, private railway in suburban area, and Japan Railway (JR) in both central and suburban area. An indicator framework is established to measure the node value by accessible opportunities, network centrality, and train service, and measure the place value by density, design, and diversity. Using open-source urban data, we generate a series of node and place indicators for each station and develop a composite node value index and place value index with information entropy weighting. The results show that node value and place value have positive impacts on ridership and node value’s impact is five times higher than place value. Stations balanced between node and place value can be uncoordinated with ridership, while stations unbalanced between node and place value can coordinate with ridership. JR has better node-place balance and ridership coordination than subway and private railway. Several implications are drawn for ridership coordination with node and place value, including planning for a more mixed urban structure and using through trains to connect central and suburban transit networks. The results of this study would inform transport planners of better organizing transit network, land use, and ridership in urban space.",1361-9209,Not found
Real-time identification of aircraft sound events,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102527,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Metropolitan airports constitute an environmental nuisance, mainly due to noise pollution originating from aircraft landings and takeoffs, affecting the wellbeing of the airports’ neighboring populations. Noise measurement is considered the fundamental means to evaluate, enforce, validate, and control noise abatement. Noise measurements performed by sound monitors located close to urban airports are often disrupted by urban background noise that interferes with aircraft sounds. Detecting aircraft noise, classifying, identifying, and separating it from the residual background noise is a challenge for unattended aircraft noise monitors. This paper suggests a simple and inexpensive methodology, based on ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), which can facilitate isolating aircraft noise from background noise. Experiments showed that using ADS-B driven noise monitors is at least as accurate as the commonly used radar–driven noise monitors, in terms of true positive, false positive, or false negative detection during the examined periods.",1361-9209,Not found
Exploring spatial heterogeneity in accessibility and transit mode choice,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102521,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Since accessibility is an important goal for sustainable transportation planning, this study analyzes the impact of accessibility on transit mode choice to investigate the potential reasons for the differences in the travel behavior of urban and suburban residents. To attain this purpose, two levels of spatial heterogeneity are considered. The first level is residential spatial heterogeneity, which represents the variations in the impacts of the factors between urban and suburban regions. The second level is the OD spatial heterogeneity, which represents whether the travel is between urban and suburban areas. Taking Xiamen city as a case study and considering the relationships between three OD characteristics (OD transit accessibility, OD travel distance, and OD spatial heterogeneity), this paper uses a joint analysis of the probit model and the structural equation model for multi-group samples. The results indicate that the low transit accessibility in suburban areas is related to lower public transportation use by suburban residents and less inter-regional bus travel by urban residents. The findings provide empirical support for the importance of suburban infrastructure development.",1361-9209,Not found
Influence of distance from traffic sounds on physiological indicators and subjective evaluation,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102538,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This study examined the influence of different distances of traffic noise and sea sounds on physiological indicators and subjective evaluation.

Participants displayed higher heart rate, amplitude of the R-wave (ΔR), heart rate variability, respiration rate, and skin conductance level (SCL) when close to the sound source. Actual distance attenuation affected most subjective evaluation factors (except for Familiarity and Excitement). The ΔR, electroencephalography alpha reactivity, and electroencephalography beta reactivity with actual distant sounds were lower and SCL was higher, relative to those with artificial distant sounds.

Green and regional?

The framework allows for a transparent evaluation of the supply of green electricity for electric vehicles from different stakeholder perspectives, without the direct involvement and reassessment by the experts. The relevant criteria for the evaluation are derived from literature, an analysis of eco-labels for electricity tariffs, and 33 expert interviews from four different stakeholder groups (municipal utilities, academia and science, non-governmental organizations, and automobile manufacturers). Eight criteria have been found to be particularly relevant for green electricity service evaluation: regionality, transparency, balancing period, additionality, land use, greenhouse gas emissions, smart charging (via a flexibility discount), and quality premium. The evaluation framework comprises value scores, which represent the degree to which a specific green charging service satisfies a given quality criterion, and combines them with the weights derived in the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The results differ markedly between stakeholder groups and point to the particular importance of additionality, technology-specific greenhouse gas emissions, and transparency. The framework seems useful for service design by (municipal) utilities, charge point operators, non-governmental organizations, and aggregators offering smart charging solutions.",1361-9209,Not found

Transportation strategies for a 1.5 °C world: A comparison of four countries,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102526,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Decarbonizing transportation in emerging economies will be one of the key challenges in global climate change mitigation efforts. In this paper, pathways are developed towards achieving a 1.5° degree scenario for land-transport for four emerging economies (Brazil, India, Kenya and Vietnam). The aim is to highlight the key opportunities and challenges for low-carbon transport in countries with rapidly growing mobility demand. The main focus of this paper is to reconcile actual and required emission reduction targets and develop plausible pathways to achieve these targets. The paper also identifies potential strategies and measures for these countries to follow these pathways. The analysis considers the contributions of “avoid” (cutting travel growth), “shift” (to lower CO2 modes) and “improve” (vehicle and fuel CO2 characteristics) interventions to decarbonisation scenarios. These scenarios aim to inform renewed Nationally Determined Contributions and shed light on the feasibility of deep decarbonisation pathways that would be in line with the Paris Agreement. Results from this study show that achieving 1.5DS would require dramatic changes in travel patterns, technology and fuels, and major intensification of current policy approaches. Decarbonization solutions will need to include greater use and investment of efficient modes, major shifts toward near-zero carbon fuels such as clean electricity, systems integration, modal shift and urban planning solutions. Although the socio-economic situations and national transport systems differ between the selected countries, some fairly similar strategies appear likely to be core to the mitigation effort, such as rapid growth in light- and heavy-duty vehicle electrification and investments in public transit systems.",1361-9209,Not found

First, we modelled the inter-specific variation in roadkill’ frequency across the avian phylogeny, testing for phylogenetic signal. Then, we explored the association between frequency of roadkill and some avian traits and evolutionary distinctiveness score of species. The rate of roadkill did not show a phylogenetic signal, indicating that the incidence of avian casualties is independent of the phylogenetic position of species. The incidence of roadkill was unrelated to the evolutionary distinctiveness, distribution range size, type of diet, or period of activity of species, but was slightly negatively associated with the species’ body mass. This result implies that roadkill is a form of anthropogenic mortality widely generalized concerning avian phylogeny. We highlight that roadkill mitigation measures could benefit from incorporating peculiarities of local or regional avifauna.",1361-9209,Not found

The TIS approach analytically distinguishes between different innovation system functions that are important for new technologies to develop and diffuse beyond an early phase of experimentation. This provides a basis for technology-specific policy recommendations. We apply the TIS framework to the case of battery-electric and hydrogen energy solutions for coastal maritime transport in Norway.

Warning systems triggered by trains increase flight-initiation times of wildlife,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102502,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Trains on railways collide with and kill wildlife, incurring economic costs for railway operators and impacting species of conservation concern. We proposed to address this problem with train-triggered warning signals, consisting of flashing lights and bell sounds emitted in the 30 s leading up to train arrival, that animals could learn to associate with train arrival. We installed our warning systems at four sites on an active railway where train-triggered cameras recorded the responses of animals to trains. We contrasted the observed flight initiation times when warning signals were active (treatment) and inactive (control) and when trains approached from straight versus curved track, predicting that animals would be more responsive to warning signals on curved approaches because those trains would be harder for animals to detect. When warning signals were provided, animals left the track earlier. For animals larger than and including coyotes (Canis latrans), flight responses were 62% earlier (17.0 s, SE = 1.5 vs. 10.5 s, SE = 1.2 ); smaller animals initiated flight responses 29% earlier (14.6 s, SE = 1.9 vs. 11.3 s, SE = 1.6 ). Contrary to our prediction, animals were more responsive to warning signals when trains approached from straightaways (large animals 10.3 s earlier for treatment, SE = 2.6 ; small animals 4.2 s earlier for treatment, SE = 2.4 ) than when trains approached from curves (large animals 2.7 s earlier for treatment, SE = 2.8 ; small animals 2.4 s earlier for treatment, SE = 1.6 ).

The results show that: (1) The crested ibis and the little egret (Egretta garzetta) were the two most abundant waterfowl species in the study area. The relative abundance index of these two species were about 43.33% and 42.75%, respectively; (2) 92.86% of the observed crested ibises were firstly detected within the range of 0 m to 25 m of the vicinity of the railway bridge; (3) The ratio between crossing over and under the railway bridge is about 7:3, which we found that crested ibises preferred flying over the bridge, but little egrets were more likely to cross the railway below the bridge. In the end, we recommend that, while the collision risk for the crested ibis could be low, protection structures, such as barrier poles or fences, should still be considered to avoid possible collisions of other co-habitants and promote conservation for multiple bird species in the area.",1361-9209,Not found

Transportation impact assessment following a potential Alpine fault earthquake in New Zealand,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102511,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The Alpine fault, one of the major fault systems in New Zealand, extends over 600 km in the South Island. There is a high probability of a rupture in the next 50 years, meaning that the next large earthquake on the Alpine Fault is likely to occur within our, or our children’s, lifetime. This is predicted to result in severe damage to the built environment, especially to infrastructure. To estimate the performance of the road network impacted by an Alpine Fault Magnitude 8 earthquake scenario, this research developed a generalizable methodology to simulate post-disaster transportation impacts on a large regional road network. This included the base model development and model calibration, as well as validation in a post-disaster situation. Post-disaster corridor and district trip analyses were undertaken using the outputs of the dynamic assignment, including mean travel time, total travel time, total travelled distance, and flow. The result of corridor analysis shows the significant increase in flow and total travel time on SH1 between Marlborough and SH7, and SH6 connecting Nelson to Marlborough one day and one week after the impact. The trip analysis of one day, one week, six months, and beyond six months after the earthquake indicates that around 2.02%, 1.16%, 0.39%, and 0.13% of total trips, respectively, cannot occur due to accessibility issues. Almost all of the inter-district trips from the three main impacted districts, namely Buller, Westland, and Grey, would be cancelled for at least one week after the earthquake with the impact on operational performance still ongoing. Trips that can occur typically face a significant increase in travelled distance and, consequently, travel time.

The performance of the proposed system is compared to various single-objective optimizations. Simulation results show the significance of incorporating real-time emission and traffic state into the dynamic routing, along with considering the expected delays at the downstream intersections.

We develop an integer optimization model that represents the key decisions of which journeys to select to ship various types, and quantities, of products onto containers of various sizes. We generate problem instances using international supply chain data inspired by two large United Kingdom (UK) retailers. Our model is useful for evaluating the feasibility of coopetition in container shipping, which we define as a contractual agreement with a 4PL, of which consolidation is one operational dimension. We conduct a variety of sensitivity analyses around the cost of fuel, cost of carbon emissions, and under coopetition or competition, to better understand their effects on model outcomes. Although some studies have mentioned that coopetition can prove economically beneficial, our study has shown that for the data and model we consider, the advantages of coopetition are quite limited. Our findings suggest there are limited economic or environmental benefits associated with the competition or coopetition scenarios when only fuel costs increase. The greatest benefits from an environmental perspective occur when joint increases of fuel and CO2 costs occur, which result in greater environmental co-benefits in the coopetition case. Alternatively, CO2 cost increases show that competition contexts had greater environmental benefit.",1361-9209,Not found
Monitoring of air emissions in maritime ports,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102479,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Maritime ports play a crucial role in the development of domestic and international trade and economies. Although near-port communities profit from economic benefits, there exist significant concerns regarding exposure to air emissions, which affect human health and climate change. To tackle this issue, a port authority can develop emission reduction plans and projects, whose performance is tracked through an air emissions inventory (EI). Despite the attention on EI methodologies in the past, little research has focused on the implementation of methodologies in information systems. Therefore, a case study is conducted in this paper to investigate the motivation for creating EIs and the obstacles in the EI-creation process from an information systems perspective. The results indicate that data confidentiality and weak information systems are major obstacles, which hinder the creation of high-quality EIs and generate additional costs. Our findings enable port stakeholders and decision makers to understand the current obstacles and facilitate the development of adequate information systems that support the creation of high-quality EIs.",1361-9209,Not found
Vulnerability of the accessibility to grocery shopping in the event of flooding,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102510,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The main purpose of the article was to determine how vulnerable the accessibility to grocery shops is in the event of non-typical occurrences (floods) which impact the regular functioning of the road transport system. In order to accomplish this goal, a number of research methods were applied, including techniques for the identification of closures within the road network, the determination of the catchment area, and modelling the distribution of traffic flows. The proposed methods can be applied in modelling and simulating traffic both in regular conditions and in the event of a non-typical occurrence as the study involved integrated methods of combined probability theory of spatial integration and the determination of the catchment market area, the application of which would not be possible without access to and availability of a wide spectrum of sources.

Greenhouse gas emissions from high-speed rail infrastructure construction in Korea,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102514,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"This study presents an estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the construction phase of a high-speed rail (HSR) line infrastructure from Osong to Gwangju (Korea), which became operational in 2015. The total GHG emissions were approximately 3.7 MtCO2-equivalents (CO2eq.), of which an approximately 92% originated from the use of materials, an indirect source. More specifically, this study quantified GHG emissions from construction modules covering earthworks, civil engineering activities (such as the construction of tunnels, viaducts, and bridges), railway tracks, passenger stations, and energy transmission and telecommunication systems for the entire HSR lines while identifying the key activity to each module.

Policy implementation barriers and economic analysis of shore power promotion in China,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102506,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"The mandatory use of shore power (SP), in place of auxiliary engine generated power, has been adopted worldwide as one of the effective measures to reduce ships' in-port emissions when they berth at ports. However, SP promotion is not smooth in many countries. This paper takes China as an example to explore the barriers to SP policy implementation by conducting in-depth interviews and builds cost-benefit models to estimate the costs and investment payback years of SP reconstruction of the port and ships based on subsidy policies. Specifically, real data collected from the Port of Shanghai are used as key parameters in the economic analysis. The results show that the government should launch appropriate subsidy policies to boost the promotion of SP technologies. The more efficient the subsidies that the government offers to ports and shipping companies for SP facility reconstruction are, the faster these companies can recover the cost.",1361-9209,Not found
Buying versus renting: On the environmental friendliness of item-sharing,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102407,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Item-sharing is a concept of the sharing economy where items such as tools or leisure equipment are made available to a community and are accessed need-based. This allows to serve demand with a few highly utilized items, which is why item-sharing connotes resource efficiency and environmental friendliness. However, a shared use also necessitates to (repeatedly) transport single items between consecutive consumers. This kind of transports are relatively inefficient and may significantly affect the environmental efficiency of item-sharing. We investigate to what extent a few shared items allow to serve demand and under which circumstances the environmental benefit of providing fewer items is larger than the negative effects of a higher transportation effort. To this end, we develop a business model comparison framework to analyze and compare alternative ways of serving requests regarding the degree of request fulfillment and the emissions that are released during item production and transport. Our comparison includes variants of a traditional sales-based approach and two types of item-sharing in which items are either exchanged via stations or transferred directly from one consumer to another. We show by simulation studies for a large metropolitan area that item-sharing with direct transfers has a great emissions-cutting potential and that it becomes even more efficient if item exchanges are facilitated through so-called crowdshippers who offer to conduct transports on trips they would make anyway. The low environmental impact of item-sharing is further demonstrated in experiments with different requesting behaviors, various emission rates, and item replacements due to wear and obsolescence.",1361-9209,Not found

The characteristics of asphalt VOCs have been partly investigated so far, thus hindering the proper accomplishment of mitigation strategies. To address this issue, this study conducted a comprehensive investigation on VOCs composition and concentration by means of Thermal Desorption-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). Air samples were collected during the production and the construction of an asphalt pavement located in Inner Mongolia, China, considering the four key locations for VOCs emissions: asphalt laboratory, mixing plant, asphalt storage tank and paving construction site. The analyses detected up to 135 different VOCs types. The asphalt storage tank was responsible for the most abundant VOCs emission, nearly 110 μg/L, which was almost equal to 3 and 27 times the concentration related to asphalt plant (40.08 μg/L) and paving site (4.08 μg/L), respectively. Considering the construction site, the quantity of VOCs was comprised between 2 and 4 times the amount generated in the asphalt laboratory. This study aimed to assess the VOCs concentration quantitatively during both production and pavement construction operations, and the latter stage represents the more relevant scenario for future investigations.",1361-9209,Not found
Willingness to accept values for vehicle-to-grid service in South Korea,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102487,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Under the new climate-change regime, electric vehicles (EVs) have received particular attention for their ability to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

An online contingent valuation oriented survey of 1007 interviewees was conducted for deriving their willingness-to-accept for the service. The mean willingness-to-accept estimate was achieved as KRW 9821 (USD 8.83) per month, per vehicle; thus, the estimated annual benefit amounted to KRW 117,852 (USD 106.01). The findings can offer a valuable guideline for determining the economic feasibility of a V2G service.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the traffic noise pollution based on noise maps. Twenty-four-hour noise maps of the Chancheng District in Foshan, China were developed for this study, and the results analyzed. The study area is divided into four types, based on the land use requirements for the acoustic environment, and the calculated noise value is compared to the noise limits of each class of the area. The average equivalent sound pressure level of the entire study area indicates the noise pollution is modest, but further analysis of the noise data in various types of areas shows a high magnitude of noise and long-lasting noise pollution near street-front buildings as well as the areas where quietness is required. It was also found that the noise level of the city is higher during off-peak hours than during rush hours, probably due to the faster speed and larger traffic volume during the off-peak hours. It is urgent to develop effective noise reduction measures to mitigate traffic noise pollution at night, based on the evaluation results.",1361-9209,Not found

Results suggest that pedestrians can be classified into two latent classes. Pedestrians in both classes prefer routes with a fence and lower floor area ratio. Except for the common significant results in the two classes, pedestrians who work in the area in class 1 attach a higher utility to shorter routes, lower width of the sidewalks, less street greenery, less traffic lights number, and smaller width of the road.

Spatiotemporal variation and determinants of carbon emissions generated by household private car,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102490,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"Given the large accumulation of Greenhouse Gas emissions released by household, individual behaviors play a vital role in decarbonization measurement. Among different residents’ behaviors, using private car is an essential source of household carbon emission. Therefore, deepening the understanding about its variation and determinants is of great importance for decarbonizing individual behaviors. Taking Japan as example, this study firstly evaluates the emissions generated by household private car from 1990 to 2016. Then, by using econometric model, cluster and spatial autocorrelation analysis, both spatiotemporal trend and emissions determinants are given out. Results indicate that although the private car emissions across the whole extent of Japan is declining, depopulation still contributes to increasing emissions in some prefectures. Last, given the future depopulation trend, target-specific decarbonization policy is suggested to take demographic features as the first consideration.",1361-9209,Not found
A conceptual framework for incorporating competitiveness into network-level transit quality metrics,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102484,87,2020-10-01,2020,10,"In today’s mobility context, people have more mode choices than in the past, and many of those new choices are auto-based. This has led to a resurgence of transit agencies rethinking their networks and how well they connect people to opportunities. This paper proposes a new theoretical framework, Competitive Access, for transportation researchers and practitioners to use in describing and measuring regional transit access. The Competitive Access framework incorporates the concept of competitiveness between auto-based modes and transit, and is flexible enough to capture the varying contexts in which accessibility can change between and within regions. Using this framework, we propose two measures that describe the trip coverage and regional access provided by a transit network. These measures better reflect the realities experienced by riders in comparison to traditional access measures. Additionally, this paper includes a guide for practitioners to implement the framework and its associated measures in a network redesign context.",1361-9209,Not found

Projections indicate that electric vehicles (EVs) will attain a considerable portion of the vehicle market in the next decade. In this paper, Well-to-Wheels (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are analyzed both for conventional and EVs by using generated driving cycle. An up to date driving cycle for Istanbul is developed (so called Istanbul Driving Cycle) by using collected traffic data across various sections of the city. An internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and an electric vehicle (EV) are tested on a chassis dynamometer under the same conditions to determine specific energy consumption and specific emissions. Turkey’s electricity production infrastructure is analyzed and the emission factor of electricity production of Turkey is estimated. This paper concludes that, utilization of EVs instead of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) can save about 109.5 g CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) per kilometer according to WTW methodology under the used Istanbul Driving Cycle.

Using the 2013 night-time data as reference variables, comparative results showed that longer mobilization time and longer clearance time were required at night than during the day. People tended to spend less time on evacuation preparation after an earthquake experience.

We compare the results, which reflect emissions under test bench conditions, with those of diesel cars under the assumption that NOX emissions reflect realistic driving behavior. We find that diesel cars with idealized emissions are superior to petrol cars with regard to external costs and that electric cars have only partially lower external costs than diesel cars. However, when realistic driving behaviors are considered, diesel engines constitute the worst powertrain in all cases. Our results show that the Dieselgate has led to substantially higher external costs than cars which would comply with environmental regulations under realistic driving conditions.",1361-9209,Not found

While conventional, forecast-based assessment practices are acknowledged to be of limited relevance in assessing potential trend-breaking developments, those practices have become strongly institutionalised and proven difficult to challenge. Applying a discourse perspective, this paper contributes with a practice-oriented analysis of how knowledge perspectives and established assessment practices influenced the consideration of alternative development directions and policy measures in the Swedish 12-year National Investment Plan for road and rail infrastructure 2018–2029. More specifically, the analysis regards how alternative futures and measures aimed at supporting a more ’transport efficient society’ were addressed and assessed. The analysis illuminates a strong influence of established practices over the definition of what is considered relevant knowledge, in constructing an understanding of transport infrastructure investments as insignificant to climate mitigation, and in legitimizing the marginalization of alternative development directions. In effect, the study shows how established practices may result in significant democratic consequences, when public and political discussion over transport futures and climate mitigation pathways is constrained by a narrow span of possible futures presented.",1361-9209,Not found

As a major contribution of this research, our analyses demonstrate that the average effects of built environment features on people’s commuting patterns and job accessibility mask considerable heterogeneity across different commute modes and neighborhood types. Using multiple regression models, we found that public transit commuters are more responsive to changes in built environments than private vehicle commuters. Subdivided samples also show that several built environment features affect job accessibility in job-dense downtown neighborhoods differently than in other types of neighborhoods (i.e. non-downtown urban neighborhoods, new town neighborhoods, rural neighborhoods), suggesting the nonlinearity in these relationships. This research has important implications to urban policymaking, especially in addressing the needs of different transit users (rail, bus, mixed) versus automobile users, as well as the needs of different types of neighborhoods.

The empirical results from a survey in China reveal that the consistency, coherence, and credibility of policy mixes matter greatly in increasing an individual’s EV purchase intention, whereas comprehensiveness has a non-significant effect. More importantly, the consistency negatively moderates the effects of consumer attitude, subjective norm, and personal norm on purchase intention, but positively moderates the relationship between perceived behavioral control and purchase intention. This paper makes theoretical contributions by extending the TPB from a policy mix perspective, which provides new knowledge for both policy research and EV adoption literature.

Biologists recorded more mammal species killed, a higher diversity index and a different composition of dominants in the roadkills, as well as different numbers and locations of hotspots. Traffic intensity and population size explained 63–93% of the variation in roadkill numbers in ungulates. Professional monitoring effort and traffic intensity explained nearly 90% of variation in roadkill numbers, 70% of variation in recorded species and 40% of diversity variation.

Externally, a subsidy policy is considered to stimulate rail freight. Based on Lyapunov optimization, this multi-slot global optimization problem is converted into a series of low-complexity problems that only require knowledge of the instantaneous system state. The equivalence of this transformation is proved theoretically. Then Harmony search algorithm is used to solve these low-complexity models. A case study based on the transportation network composed of five central cities in China is conducted. Compared with the application of the actual fixed rail freight rates, a CO2 emission reduction of 3261 t can be achieved with the dynamic pricing strategy.

The advancement of the research agenda in activity-based studies calls for improved accessibility measures that can capture urban dynamics and human activity-travel patterns at more fine-grained resolutions, both spatially and temporally. In this paper, we draw on the rich spatial and temporal information from online crowdsourcing data on points-of-interest and propose a set of new measures of accessibility to opportunities and services that incorporate the dynamics of businesses environment in Singapore. The new measures consider both the spatial distribution of business establishments and their open time over the day. We then feed the new and traditional accessibility measures into destination choice models to assess whether capturing the temporal variation in accessibility and business environment help to improve the model performance. We find that the model with dynamic accessibility measures outperforms models with traditional static accessibility measures. The results suggest that travelers are likely to consider both the spatial and temporal dimensions of accessibility when choosing destinations for their activities.

Second, utilizing real-word delivery demand data, full-day parcel-delivery operations of a three-digit postal code area in both urban and rural contexts are simulated for UAVs and ground delivery modes. The results show that in general, UAVs produce significantly lower emissions compared to ground delivery per parcel-km and up to 35% compared to electric vehicles.

Our research aims to reveal the main shared viewpoints on the preferred paths towards sustainable urban mobility. We use the Q method, which is a statistical method to study subjectivity. It enables determination of characteristic shared viewpoints on a particular subject. A qualitative analysis assessing subjective opinions is combined with the quantitative approach of a factor analysis of statements ranked by respondents.

The main findings are expressed in terms of number of trips, mode shares and distance travelled by mode. The results show that it is possible to push the transport sector toward a more sustainable state if comprehensive policy measures are established to reduce road transport and make other modes of transport more attractive. In the Regulated Shift scenario, the distance travelled on the road is 20% lower for passenger transport and 4% lower for freight transport compared to the Reference scenario.

Results of experiments based on national average travel data indicate that the actual WPC strategy varies by budget level. Through optimization, the strategy could reduce impacts of the varied electricity price by shifting charging schedules to periods when electricity prices are low. Also, the model is expanded to study the trade-off between providing WPC and addressing consequence of degraded charging service by including the per-mile shadow cost of unsatisfied charging demand.

The optimization strategies developed in this study could provide more informative reference for the decision-makers.

Potential of machine learning for prediction of traffic related air pollution,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102599,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Land use regression (LUR) has been extensively used to capture the spatial distribution of air pollution. However, regional background and non-linear relationships can be challenging to capture using linear approaches. Machine learning approaches have recently been used in air quality prediction. Using data from a mobile campaign of fine particulate matter and black carbon in Toronto, Canada, this study investigates the boundaries of LUR approaches and the potential of two different machine learning models: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and gradient boost. In addition, a moving camera was used to collect real-time traffic. Models developed for fine particulate matter performed better than those for black carbon. For the same pollutants, machine learning exhibited superior performance over LUR, demonstrating that LUR performance could benefit from understanding how explanatory variables were expressed in machine learning models. This study unveils the black-box nature of machine learning algorithms by investigating the performance of different models in the context of how they capture the relationship between air quality and various predictors.",1361-9209,Not found
To Green or Not to Green Trucking? Exploring the Canadian Case,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102591,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The purpose of this paper is to explore the current state of environmental sustainability in the Canadian trucking sector by examining the types of green initiatives that have been adopted by Canadian trucking companies and the associated drivers and barriers that can affect the adoption of such initiatives. The approach is explorative with a cross sectional design that examines eight small-to-medium sized trucking companies operating in the province of Ontario, Canada. The findings illustrate that the implementation of green initiatives is at an early stage in the province, and that Canadian trucking companies face a multitude of drivers and barriers when adopting green initiatives. Overall, there is a high degree of variation among the cases; however, the findings suggest that three different approaches to environmental sustainability (i.e., proactive, reactive, and stagnating) can be observed.

Green efficiency evaluation and improvement of Chinese ports: A cross-efficiency model,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102590,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"With the current global environmental degradation and energy consumption demands, people are placing great emphasis on studying green ports, including ways to evaluate their green efficiency. However, few studies exist that both quantitatively evaluate the port’s green efficiency and consider the competition and cooperation among them. This study introduces a new development mode for port groups: ‘intra-group cooperation and out-group competition’, which considers the competition and cooperation among ports. Moreover, from a quantitative perspective, the green efficiency of 18 ports in China’s five port groups are compared from 2012 to 2016 using the game cross-efficiency and the competition and cooperation cross-efficiency models in a data envelopment analysis (DEA). Furthermore, the factors that influence the ports’ green efficiency are analysed using a Tobit regression model, revealing that the green efficiency of Chinese ports are generally low, with numerous problems existing in the ports’ green development process. Compared with the current competitive development model among ports, our development model proposed is more conducive to improving the green efficiency of Chinese ports. Moreover, we find that economic development, industrial structure, port throughput (passenger and foreign trade), and regional openness can improve the ports’ green efficiency, while nitrogen oxides (NOX) and sulfur oxides (SOX) emissions from ports have a significant negative impact. Finally, to address problems in the green development of ports, a series of green development strategies are proposed to better promote their green development.",1361-9209,Not found
Exploring extreme commuting and its relationship to land use and socioeconomics in the central Puget Sound,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102574,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Extreme commuters, who spend 90 min or more on one-way commuting, has been a rapidly growing group. A few studies explain extreme commuting from the socioeconomic and land-use perspectives. However, little research takes spatial variations into account, nor does it make a comparison of different transportation modes. This paper applies Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model and binary logistic model to explore extreme commuting and its relationship to land-use and socioeconomic attributes in the central Puget Sound. Data used include the Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) at the census tract level and the Puget Sound Travel Survey of the individual households. The results demonstrate both significant local variations of the effects of influencing factors and the differences in different transportation modes. These findings indicate that extreme commuting is not necessarily a constrained choice behavior due to socioeconomic disadvantages and that urban land-use planning is significant in explaining extreme commuting.",1361-9209,Not found
Home charging and electric vehicle diffusion: Agent-based simulation using choice-based conjoint data,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102475,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Electric vehicles offer the potential of climate-friendly driving and have received more and more attention in diffusion research recently. However, the effect of the availability of home charging options on the market potential of electric vehicles has not been targeted in detail in the diffusion process so far, although it represents a beneficial differentiation to conventional vehicles. Therefore, we present an agent-based simulation to address the buying behavior of German consumers regarding electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles using empirical data primarily derived from a choice-based conjoint study. We explicitly consider individual possibilities of home charging in our model, which appears to have an important influence on the diffusion of both, electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. However, its importance decreases with faster charging times at public charging stations. Furthermore, our findings reveal that in the longer term, technological progress in charging time, range, and charging station density of electric vehicles is presumably cannibalizing plug-in hybrid electric vehicles’ market shares more than that of conventional vehicles. However, with still lower technological capabilities of electric vehicles, a governmental subsidy can initially promote plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, but electric vehicles will benefit later from that promotional effect.",1361-9209,Not found
Marginal emission factors for public transit: Effects of urban scale and density,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102585,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between fundamental urban scale characteristics (population, area, density) and marginal emission factors (MEF) for public transit. Emissions intensity of travel is typically examined using average emission factors (AEF), but MEF (how emissions change with travel volume) are more important for understanding the effects of interventions. MEF and AEF are estimated and compared for transit systems across the U.S. using panel data from 376 urban areas over 27 years. Results show that both MEF and AEF vary substantially across cities and decrease with urban population, area, density, and transit system extent – but AEF are around 50% more sensitive to urban scale. The distinction between MEF and AEF is especially important for bus transit in smaller, less dense cities. Marginal analysis shows that mode shift from private vehicles to transit should be encouraged, even where average emissions from transit are higher.",1361-9209,Not found
Greenhouse gas emission prediction on road network using deep sequence learning,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102593,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Mitigating the substantial undesirable impact of transportation systems on the environment is paramount. Thus, predicting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is one of the profound topics, especially with the emergence of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). We developed a deep learning framework to predict link-level GHG emission rate (ER) (in CO 2 eq gram/second) based on the most representative predictors, such as speed, density, and GHG ER of previous time steps. In particular, various specifications of the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks with explanatory variables were examined, and were compared with clustering and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with explanatory variables. The downtown Toronto road network was used as the study area, and highly detailed data were synthesized using a calibrated traffic microsimulation and MOVES. It was found that LSTM specification with speed, density, GHG ER, and in-links speed from three previous minutes performed the best while adopting two hidden layers, and when the hyper-parameters were systematically tuned. Adopting a 30-second updating interval slightly improved the correlation between true (simulated) and predicted GHG ERs (from predictive models), but contributed negatively to the prediction accuracy as reflected in the increased root mean square error (RMSE) value. Efficiently predicting GHG emissions at a higher frequency with lower data requirements will pave the way for various applications, e.g. anticipatory eco-routing in large-scale road networks to alleviate the adverse impact on global warming.",1361-9209,Not found
"Identifying interactions between policy, accountability and outcomes for adaptation of urban roads",10.1016/j.trd.2020.102595,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Several decision-making frameworks are available to foster climate adaptation of road infrastructure, but these focus mainly on the adaptation of national or regional roads. Urban road infrastructure is equally important for the efficient functioning of society and it is imperative to understand the peculiarities of adapting these types of roads, however, existing frameworks may not be appropriate for this purpose. This paper presents a conceptual framework called the “Expanded Adaptation Action Cycles” (EAAC) that conceptualizes in a simple, yet comprehensive manner the adaptation planning processes of urban road infrastructure. A case study of the decision-making processes for the development and maintenance of the road network of Bogotá, Colombia was conducted to demonstrate the practical utility of this framework as a diagnostic tool. Analysing the evidence collected using the EAAC framework indicates that the city is currently at the early stages of its adaptation planning and that the adaptation measures being considered suggest that, at most, the city is aiming to implement incremental adaptation. This demonstrates how the EAAC framework provides the ability to understand the relative position of a city’s approach to adaptation planning within a wider spectrum of possibilities, providing insight into the potential impact of possible planning interventions.",1361-9209,Not found

However, the literature provides little evidence on the impacts of changes in the built environment (BE) on commuting mode shift, and few studies shed light on the gender differences in the impacts of influential factors. Based on longitudinal data from China, this study explores how life events and changes in the BE influence commuting mode shift and whether the impacts differ between household couples. The results identify significant differences in the impacts of the influential factors between household couples. Most life events show significant impacts on the spouses’ commuting mode shift, whereas changes in the BE characteristics are more influential on the wife’s modal shift behavior. These findings suggest that urban planners and policy makers should better understand the gender differences to develop gender-equal transportation systems when implementing urban planning and transportation strategies.",1361-9209,Not found
Multimodal transportation system protection against sea level rise,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102568,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Transportation infrastructure resilience is an important component of a region’s ability to recover from natural disasters. While Sea Level Rise (SLR) is becoming inevitable with climate change, little is known of the impact of protection strategies on multiple modes of transport. The present paper proposes a framework where a range of coastal protection strategies are undertaken in the case of one meter of SLR (expected by the year 2100). The methodology incorporates high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations using the Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) and traffic simulations using the Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MATSim) to quantify the potential impact of SLR and protection strategies on both the highway and public transit systems in the San Francisco Bay Area. The results of the traffic simulations are analyzed at the regional and Transportation Analysis Zone (TAZ) levels. Modeling results show that coastal protection of one area will affect the transportation system (sometimes negatively) in areas beyond its vicinity. The improved spatial resolution, and the integration of highway and transit networks in a unified model, reveal transportation phenomena that were not identified in previous studies. By quantifying the impacts on commuters’ mobility in different TAZs, the methodology can be used to develop effective and inclusive strategies against SLR for a given region of interest.",1361-9209,Not found
Predictive cordon pricing to reduce air pollution,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102564,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Traffic is a major contributor to emissions in many large cities with severe air pollution. Experience in London, Milan, and Stockholm shows that charging for the use of roads can be effective in reducing emissions, as well as congestion. This study examines the use of predictive cordon tolls based on weather forecasts to reduce ambient air pollution and congestion. Travelers choose their destinations inside or outside the cordon, and whether to drive or take public transport. Passenger vehicles are divided into three classes according to their emission characteristics, and higher tolls are imposed on more polluting vehicles. The Box model of emission dispersion is used to predict air quality. A Markov decision-making process then determines daily toll levels with the objective of maximizing welfare measured by travelers’ surplus, toll revenue, and air pollution health costs. The model is applied to a hypothetical network using recorded weather data for Tehran in 2016. With base-case parameter values, predictive pricing reduces the daily average CO concentration as well as the number of days with dangerous air quality. Predictive pricing yields a higher welfare gain than a fixed toll (i.e., the same every day regardless of weather conditions). The effects of weather information, wind forecast accuracy, forecast time horizon, values of travel time, destination attractions, and road link capacity on the benefits from predictive pricing are analyzed. The performance of the model under randomized weather conditions is also assessed.",1361-9209,Not found

In this paper, we proposed a machine learning modeling method using large on-road data collected from a fleet of 27 vehicles. The usability of models in absence of specialized instruments was in focus. We tried to improve the accuracy of our base models by introducing engine-speed estimates through a cascaded modeling procedure. As a result, the accuracy of models reached 83%, while improvements as high as 37% were achieved depending on the technique (support vector regression or artificial neural networks) and vehicle class. Finally, we took the first step from vehicle-specific models towards category-specific modeling by a categorical analysis over fleet attributes.",1361-9209,Not found
Well-to-tank carbon emissions from crude oil maritime transportation,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102587,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"International seaborne transport of crude oil takes place mainly on tankers, with annual seaborne crude flows totaling an estimated 12 billion barrels. To take into account the carbon footprint on crude oil from its international distribution segment, we utilize a micro-level dataset of more than 28,000 individual shipment samples to estimate each journey’s carbon emissions. The unique detailed dataset enables us to aggregate carbon emissions at the country level for importers and exporters, by trade lane, and by vessel size categories. Our methodology provides a framework for crude oil consumers to dynamically account for the carbon footprint of the commodity which is transported via different trade routes and by different vessels (size and age). So far, this dynamic emissions accounting has been largely neglected by oil consumers who typically apply one single emission factor regardless its supply chain. Our results highlight the importance for importers to consider the origin and point-of-use of crude oil in order to have a comprehensive view of its carbon footprint. The quantitative analysis in this study can feed into well-to-tank fuel emissions factors for oil and oil products in order to adopt dynamic emissions factors in companies' carbon accounting. Finally, our research is important for the design of new environmental policies for the corporate Environmental Social Governance (ESG) reporting to include downstream logistics in the overall emission accounting of oil companies.",1361-9209,Not found

Integrated scheduling of intermodal transportation with seaborne arrival uncertainty and carbon emission,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102571,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The world trade globalization process has triggered growing attention to port-centric supply chain (PCSC) management, wherein the land transport and maritime transport are connected by ports. Modern scheduling plans for PCSC should put more emphasis on intermodal transportation to achieve an effective and environmental-friendly management scheme. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated scheduling model with an improved multiple heterogeneous coding genetic algorithm for PCSC management, wherein the intermodal transportation has been investigated under seaborne uncertainties. By analyzing the overall cost and carbon emission under different operational strategies, the effects and countermeasures of integrated scheduling on system optimization and carbon emission mitigation policy in PCSC are discussed. The results of case studies based on a departure port in Southeast China indicate that the integrated scheduling method proposed can significantly decrease the overall system cost and carbon emission.

Fuel Estimation in Air Transportation: Modeling global fuel consumption for commercial aviation,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102528,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Accurate fuel burn estimation models are required to assess potential reductions in CO2 emissions stemming from new aircraft technologies.

The latter allows for accurately estimating fuel consumption for global scheduled aircraft movements of an entire year in a matter of milliseconds. We calculate total CO2 emissions from scheduled commercial aviation in 2018 to be 812 Mt. The modeling error of fuel consumption is validated against fuel burn reports and ranges below 5%. Current aircraft performance models either focus on fuel estimation accuracy or on computational efficiency. Combining both, FEAT enables rapid assessment of decarbonization strategies for commercial passenger aviation.",1361-9209,Not found

Factors affecting environmental practice adoption at small European airports: An investigation,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102572,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"The majority of the world’s 3759 commercial airports handle under 5 million passengers a year and these small airports rarely employ practices to address their environmental externalities. The aim of this research is to investigate the range of environmental practices (EPs) that are employed at small European airports and identify the factors which affect their adoption. The findings of an online survey of 413 small airports in the European Common Aviation Area reveal that the EPs most commonly adopted concern waste management and noise reduction. Privately owned airports were generally more engaged with EPs than publicly owned ones. Consumer pressure, regulatory intervention, and airport size positively affected the adoption of environmental practices whereas complexity, perceived relative advantage and human resource constraints acted as barriers to adoption.

The study builds on survey data and spatial data from three urban contexts of Beijing, Gothenburg and Malmo to analyse both individual-level and contextual factors influencing sustainable travel behaviour. The results indicate that despite varying contexts, the three dimensions of attitude, skills and access significantly explain individuals’ travel behaviour and their choice to travel by public transport, bicycle or car. Among the studied travel modes, cycling appears to be a competitive mode when the travel distances are within 5 km. In all three urban contexts, individuals who have greater environmental awareness are more likely to travel by public transport or cycling if the physical conditions facilitate using these modes. Good access to public transport is likely to increase the usage of both cycling and public transport and reduce car use. Favourable conditions for cycling within 2 km and 5 km radius can positively encourage people to use a bicycle as a feeder mode for public transport. Overall, our findings demonstrate that for mobility policies to increase individuals’ motility in relation to sustainable travel modes and encourage a travel behaviour shift towards using alternatives to cars, planners need to take more holistic approaches and design policies that deal with the three motility dimensions in an integrated manner and avoid focusing on a single dimension in isolation.",1361-9209,Not found

By using a VISSIM model, various scenarios were tested. This resulted in a qualitative insight into the energy consumption and travel time, which was validated by performing 30 driving tests and by using dynamometer data.

We evaluate cyclists’ exposure to fine particulate matter and black carbon, and used open-source data, land-use regression models, deep neural networks and spatial analysis. The application of the proposed bikeability framework reveals that the inclusion of air quality makes a significant difference when calculating bikeability index in Singapore and hence it merits serious consideration.

Survey data from 3,131 households in Austria is used to identify barriers to PEV charging and charging infrastructure usage, and investigate consumers’ preferences with respect to community-owned charging points. Four key target groups of customers for such a business model are identified based on their socio-economic characteristics, purchase history, and expressed level of environmental concerns, including current PEV owners, high income households, photovoltaic (PV) owners, and environmentalists. Identified distinct preferences for the configuration of a collective charging station amongst these groups include lower importance attached to flexibility to charge the vehicles at any time by current PEV owners, higher sensitivity to cost per charge of PV owners, and strong preferences for comfort and flexibility demonstrated by high income households.",1361-9209,Not found
Vulnerability assessment and visualization of large-scale bus transit network under route service disruption,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102570,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Having a vulnerability assessment of a large-scale bus transit network (LBTN), an essential part of urban vulnerability assessment, is indispensable for developing urban transportation sustainability. The complex network approach is usually used to realize this goal because it focuses on a mesoscopic perspective and has a unique advantage of calculation efficiency in large-scale networks. However, the vulnerability assessment of LBTNs is usually tested based on node attacks or edge attacks rather than route attacks because of the widely existing “route collinear problem”, which makes the infrastructure disruption and the route service disruption indistinguishable. This paper establishes a novel vulnerability assessment and visualization framework under the perspective of route service disruption.

Results show that all the analysed built environment attributes tend to impose salient non-linear and threshold effects on walking time. For example, population density and land use mix only increase older adults’ walking at certain levels. Ultra-densely populated areas and excessively mixed land uses may even lead to a decline in walking. Built environment interventions would consequently only be effective in certain ranges. By quantifying the relative importance of built environment attributes, we further indicate the hierarchy of intervention priorities.

The primary barriers to adoption are limited knowledge, organisational policies, as well as operational and economic factors. Overall, the AFV fleet adoption literature suggests that large firms are more likely to become early adopters, which is largely due to their willingness to accept financial risks in exchange for first mover advantages.

However,accessibility to opportunities for people who cycle is not necessarily the same across socioeconomically different population segments, and it tends to be further constrained by high costs associated with the travel distance through the roadnetwork. This research examines equality in the accessibility to employment and education among cycle-user adults in Bogotá. Using 968 reported bicycle trips with these travel purposes in the 2015 Bogotá Household Travel Survey, we estimate a potential accessibility indicator and horizontal and vertical equality indicators. First, we identify three clusters through the K-prototypes method to classify bicycle commuters based on trip and socioeconomic characteristics, and second, we calculate potential accessibility using GIS-based trip distance decay functions, which is later assessed through equality indices such as Lorenz Curves, Gini index and Palma Ratio. Results show marked differences in potential accessibility to work and study opportunities between and within clusters, where up to 90% of the analyzed population of a cyclists' cluster has access to 30% of the job and study opportunities, indicating social and spatial inequalities produced by the urban structure and individual and household characteristics of regular cyclists. Results can guide in the implementation of accurate transport policies towards more equitable and sustainable transport in cities that are experiencing increases in bicycle ridership.",1361-9209,Not found
Scenarios for transitioning cars from ICEV to BEVs and PHEVs using household level GPS travel data,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102555,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"There has been a continuous effort to quantify the expected greenhouse gas reductions from plug- in electric vehicles (PEVs). Most existing studies are based on standardized driving cycles to compare the performance of PEVs and conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. This study is based on assigning the most efficient plug-in hybrid or full electric vehicle to a household based on the household travel behavior as collected by GPS tracking data of thousands of vehicles’ real trips in California, and it found that PEV adoption can reduce greenhouse gas emission by up to 65%. We further explore the market share difference in assigning optimal vehicle models by considering vehicle-based and household-based travel demand, and we found that, given currently available technology, in many cases adoption of Plug-in Hybrid Electric vehicles (PHEVs) will not necessarily result in significantly higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (2.8% higher) compared to battery electric vehicles (BEVs), while PHEVs have advantages to satisfy household’s long-distance travel demand. However, if PHEV drivers never charge their vehicles, the achievable GHG emission reduction will be decreased by nearly 2/3.",1361-9209,Not found
The impact of socio-demographic characteristics and driving behaviors on fuel efficiency,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102565,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Fuel efficiency intuitively differs between drivers, depending on their socio-demographic characteristics and driving behavior, and can change even for the same driver in different driving environments. In this work, we examine the impact of socio-demographic characteristics, driving behavior on fuel efficiency using naturalistic driving data collected from a busy freeway in Austin, Texas. Our results show that during off-peak period, fuel efficiency is negatively correlated with commute frequency. Furthermore, fuel efficiency is also closely related to commute purpose, age and gender. During peak period, female drivers’ fuel efficiency is worse, while correlations with other socio-demographic characteristics become less prominent. In terms of driving behavior, high-speed drivers with higher average speeds and less speed variance achieve the best fuel efficiency during both peak and off-peak hours. Our study sheds lights on specific eco-friendly driving behavior and education can be targeted at those who tend to consume more fuel.",1361-9209,Not found
Assessing transport emissions reduction while increasing electric vehicles and renewable generation levels,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102560,88,2020-11-01,2020,11,"Electric Vehicles (EVs) appear as an environmental solution for transport sector since they emit zero emissions while driving. Nonetheless, the carbon intensity (CI) of the energy sources involved in the electricity generation system could seriously compromise this solution. Hence, this study proposes a methodology to verify the sustainability of the sector by the introduction of EVs. By means of the “Well-to-Wheel” tool, it compares emissions generated by two fleets: one based on internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and another one that also contemplates different EVs penetration levels. This methodology develops an iterative process on the contribution of renewable sources to the electricity generation system until a certain level of emissions reduction is achieved. The needed evolution of the CI for the electricity system is therefore deduced. The methodology has been applied to Spain by the mid-term future, given these country policies for both a high penetration of EVs and a progressive introduction of renewable sources in its electricity system. Results indicate that the current Spanish electricity mix allows for a reduction in CO2 emissions by the introduction of EVs, but a 100% renewable system will be needed for reductions up to 74 million tons per year. This research is a first-ever study to relate the forecasted Spanish environmental policies, in terms of urban transport and configuration of the power system, with a sustainable introduction of EVs in the urban fleet.

Fuel price elasticities of market shares of alternative fuel vehicles in Brazil,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102643,89,2020-12-01,2020,12,"The Brazilian Alcohol Program promotes ethanol as an alternative fuel to gasoline. Policymakers want to know the effect of relative fuel prices on demand for gasoline-fuelled and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). Considering vehicle engines dedicated to gasoline, ethanol or flex in the Brazilian market, we use market share models to estimate fuel price market share elasticities, both own and cross effects for each technology. In the first phase, when gasoline and ethanol are the only competing technologies, we find that variations in price profoundly impact the market share of new vehicles. The second phase shows how the efficiency of flex engines, reflected by the car cost per kilometre, significantly contributes to the widespread acceptance of this technology. The near-zero elasticities indicate that the market share of flex vehicles is hedged against price fluctuation.

Development of a one-day driving cycle for electric ride-hailing vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102597,89,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Developing electric ride-hailing vehicles (ERVs) is an integral part of promoting green transportation. To understand how ERVs operate, and in turn to improve their battery systems, we have developed a comprehensive, methodological framework to construct their utilization patterns and driving cycles. The methodology is based on a multi-state model (MSM). It builds one-day activity patterns of electric vehicles that belong in an ERV fleet. The driving patterns outline when (time of occurrence), for how long (duration), and under what battery conditions (state of charge) a driver typically decides to either operate or charge a vehicle. Two driving patterns, pointing toward two typical types of drivers, have been identified. By utilizing operational data in Xiamen, China, obtained from Didi Chuxing, we propose a novel method to build the first driving cycle series of ERVs, which can delineate how ERV drivers drive under the operating state. The cycle series consists of four driving cycles, synthesized by the micro-trip-based method using operational data from four time slices. Analysis against real data has shown that our method significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating the representativeness of the cycles.",1361-9209,Not found

The framework presents three innovative aspects. First, inputs from the stochastic analysis module are used in a multivariate optimisation for generating variability-robust solutions. Second, a combination of optimisation and simulation is used to finely explore the impact of realistic uncertainty uncaptured by the framework. Lastly, the framework considers the role of human beings as the final control of operational conditions.

Aiming to improve our knowledge of the AQ impacts from congestion pricing, this study integrates a disaggregate agent-based travel demand model with a hyper-local air quality model to examine emissions, air quality, and exposure. Studying congestion pricing schemes in NYC, we find that daily single-occupancy-vehicle trips to the charging area decreases by 14.5% and 24.3% under the low and high charging schemes, respectively. Correspondingly, the PM2.5 concentration decreases by 5–25% in the Central Manhattan areas in the low-toll scenario, and by more than 10% across almost all of New York City areas in the high-toll scenario.

Quantifying and analyzing traffic emission reductions from ridesharing: A case study of Shanghai,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102629,89,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Ridesharing has potential to mitigate traffic emissions. To better support policymaking, this paper endeavors to estimate and analyze emission reductions by large-scale ridesharing combining the Shareability-Network approach, the COPERT III emission model, and a speed-density traffic-flow model. Using Shanghai as a case, we show that ridesharing per se can reduce fuel-consumption (FC) by 22.88% and 15.09% in optimal and realistic scenarios, respectively, with corresponding emissions reductions. Ridesharing’s spontaneous first-order speed effect further reduces FC by 0.34–0.96%. Additionally, spatial analyses show that ridesharing reduces more emissions on severely polluted roads, leading to two spatial patterns; temporal analyses demonstrate patterns shifted from disorganized to organized. Both the phenomena can be explained by the aggregation of trips and the grading and topology of the roads. Moreover, ridesharing may also increase emissions on some branch roads, creating a new environmental injustice, which, however, is estimated to be less significant than expected.",1361-9209,Not found

Micromobility and public transport integration: The current state of knowledge,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102628,89,2020-12-01,2020,12,"Cities globally are grappling with the negative externalities of car travel and are therefore striving to move towards a more sustainable urban transportation system. The introduction and popularity of new personal transport modes, such as e-scooters and electric bicycles, could potentially accelerate this transition as they become more commonplace and are accepted into regulatory frameworks. The integration of these new modes and vehicles into public transport systems, for example, could enhance accessibility and lead to potential modal shifts away from private car use. In order to assess the potential for change that micromobility holds, it is key to study these new modes in the context of access and egress trips to and from public transport.

The exhaust emissions from sample ship are calculated using an activity-based method with 1 s temporal resolution AIS (Automatic Identification System) data. Then the regional ship exhaust emissions are estimated based on the sampling relationship. Sensitivity experiments show that the relative error of the proposed method decreases quickly with the sampling ratio (the ratio between the number of sampled ships and total ships) and it is less than 3.5% when the sampling ratio is higher than 10%.

The results show that activity satisfaction and air and noise pollution vary greatly in various microenvironments. Perceived air and noise pollution are more significant covariates of activity satisfaction than objectively measured pollution, and air pollution has a greater effect than noise pollution on activity satisfaction.

Therefore, this paper evaluated the fuel-savings of a bikesharing system in Tucson with varying substitution rates of bikesharing trips for vehicle-based trips. First, relocation operations were identified by fusing bikesharing trip and station level data. Then, the fuel consumed by the relocation truck and the fuel saved by bikesharing trips were estimated. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to investigate the fuel consumption impacts of adding more stations, optimizing the relocation routes, and using more operation trucks. After adding four more stations and optimizing the relocation routes, the required car substitution rate to offset the fuel consumed by the relocation truck decreases from 30% to 17%. Furthermore, the required substitution rate in a denser bikesharing system is less sensitive to an increase in the number of trucks.

The main purpose of this study is to study the influence of pyrolysis conditions on the performance of swine-manure-derived bio-binder, the swine manure particles were cracked at 5 pyrolysis temperatures and 2 reaction times. Ten kinds of swine-manure-derived bio-oil were prepared, and 15% bio-oil were used to partially replace petroleum asphalt to prepare corresponding bio-binder. The effects of pyrolysis conditions on the penetration, softening point, ductility, water absorption and the rheological properties of bio-binder were tested. The results show that the maximum bio-oil yield of 1 s reaction time at 550 °C pyrolysis temperature was 45.1%. The high temperature stability of bio-binder is better than that of virgin asphalt. The high temperature stability of bio-binder gradually decreases with the pyrolysis temperature and reaction time of bio-oil. The fatigue performance and low-temperature crack resistance of the bio-binder are poorer than that of virgin asphalt on the low pyrolysis temperature, but those performances will be gradually improved with the pyrolysis temperature. The low-temperature crack resistance of the binder can be improved by prolonging the cracking reaction time under a certain pyrolysis temperature.

The onboard mean PN/BC concentration ratio was low (0.7 × 106 particles ng−1 BC), typical of environments impacted by exhaust emissions. The exhaust plumes were affected by the sea breeze, with a cleaning or polluting effect depending on the wind direction relative to the ferry.

Adoption and willingness to pay for autonomous vehicles: Attitudes and latent classes,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102611,89,2020-12-01,2020,12,"This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the propensity toward autonomous vehicles (AVs). The main hypothesis of this study is that individuals’ decisions toward AVs vary by their modality style, and it is possible to identify a distinct set of attitudes toward AVs among people with distinct mobility profiles. A latent class clustering analysis model was applied to the survey data, and three distinct user classes (sub-datasets) were identified, including auto-dependent users, all-mode users, and non-drivers (passengers and transit users). Separate structural equation models were developed to identify a distinct set of attitudes for each user class and estimate their propensity toward AV technology. The results showed that attitudes play a critical role in users’ behavior toward AV adoption and WTP. Moreover, the identified attitudes for each class and their contribution to the decisions were different among the three classes, confirming the necessity to develop separate models to account for the heterogeneity in their choice behavior. In view of attitudes, pro-technology showed significant positive impacts on both AV adoption and WTP for auto-dependent users and non-drivers. While self-driving features might motivate auto-dependent users to adopt AV technologies, driving assistance features seemed to be more important for all-mode users in their adoption and WTP decisions. Trip privacy and data privacy concerns presented potential barriers for auto users and all-mode users but did not show significant impacts for non-drivers, who were more likely to be discouraged from adopting AVs by the joy of driving. The findings contribute to the current literature by providing more in-depth insights into users’ attitudes toward AV technologies and a better understanding of their decisions to adopt and pay for AV technologies.",1361-9209,Not found
Disruption in the air: The impact of flight rerouting due to air traffic control strikes,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102665,90,2021-01-01,2021,1,"When airspace sectors are disrupted airlines have the decision to either cancel, delay or reroute scheduled flights. The aim of this paper is to estimate the additional kilometres flown due to rerouted flights during air traffic control strikes. We use detailed flight-level data and information on over sixty strikes in European airspace between 2015 and 2017. We combine a difference-in-difference approach with statistical matching procedures to address that strikes do not occur randomly over time. Our estimates show that strikes significantly decrease the horizontal trajectory efficiency of operated flights, aggregating to 4.7 million additional aircraft kilometres over the sample period. This equals about 13.4 kilotonnes of additional fuel consumption and 42.2 kilotonnes of CO2-emissions. Further results suggest that these inefficiencies can be mitigated by measures that preserve continuity of service for overflights during disruptions.",1361-9209,Not found
Battery Electric Vehicle adoption in regions without strong policies,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102615,90,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Individual motorized transport is a major source of emissions and needs to be reduced to meet international agreements. Although alternatives to internal combustion engine vehicles are already on the market, without extensive political support, electric vehicle (EV) adoption remains low. Understanding the drivers of adoption of alternative technologies is key to develop effective measures to accelerate their diffusion. This paper presents individual consumer characteristics and home-location based spatial characteristics of current battery electric vehicle (BEV) and internal combustion engine vehicle holders, in a region free from strong EV policies. Using a generalized linear mixed-effects logistic model on this revealed preference data, we find that BEV adoption is predicted by technology affinity, high income, green party preferences, and living in one’s own house. Altogether, the study offers insights on the characteristics of early adopters of BEVs that can be valuable to policymakers, energy grid and charging infrastructure operators, as well as the automotive industry.",1361-9209,Not found

For LDVs, the accuracy to measure fuel consumed is set by regulation to ±5%, while for HDVs no requirements exist so far. In this study, OBFCM data from15 LDVs and 12 HDVs were recorded in lab and on-road trips. Results indicate that the fuel consumed measured by the OBFCM, for the majority of the vehicles, satisfies the accuracy requirementsof ±5% over complete laboratory tests or complete on-road trips (maximum vehicle average uncertainty ~7%). Statistical analysis showed that on-board diagnostics (OBD) accuracy can be impacted by the average vehicle speed, acceleration, and overall trip dynamicity. The lowest accuracy can be expected when vehicles are driven at low speeds under transient conditions. For most of the vehicles the distance calculated from the OBD speed signal has an accuracy within ±1.5% on-road whenGlobal Positioning System (GPS) distance is used as a reference. Both HDV and LDV results, confirmed that OBD accuracy and precision in measuring fuel consumed and distance improved for monitoring over longer periods (complete trips vs short phases).

This includes a quantitative assessment of technological potentials and of resulting energy consumption and emissions. The scenario building followed an explorative approach. Only the scenario depicting a consistent transition towards electrified mobility and regulated emissions from the energy system leads to a significant reduction in transport related CO2 emissions.

The latter is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem to minimize the fleet’s daily charging operation time. A surrogate-assisted optimization approach is proposed to solve the combinatorial optimization problem efficiently. The proposed model is tested on a realistic flexible bus service in Luxembourg. The results show that the proposed online charging policy can effectively reduce the charging delays of the fleet compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

The average fuel-saving rate for a two-truck platoon is 3.8–8.9% when the longitudinal interval varies from 5L to 0.5L. The fuel-saving rate, however, grows at a decreasing rate with the increase in truck number. Besides, the lateral offset is found to be effective when organizing the two-truck platoon, and above 30% decrease in pavement fatigue damage and 8% fuel savings will be obtained concurrently.

To maximize advantages of platooning including energy saving and C O 2 emission reduction, a mathematical model-based optimization technique is used to determine the optimal number and configuration of platoons. The energy savings of each vehicle is different due to its size and the size of adjacent vehicles. For example, even when the size of vehicles in front and behind a vehicle is large, the interior vehicle’s size affects its own energy consumption and the energy saving rate due to the vehicles in front and behind. To observe the energy saving effect of platooning, numerical experiments with heterogeneous sets of vehicles are performed.

Particularly, we investigated how the reverse U-shaped relationship between MPC and economic expansion varied in response to changes in the MPA and income inequality. A fixed-effects panel linear regression analysis was performed on a panel of 53 countries over the period of 1963–2013. This study highlights four key findings in relation to the impact of per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on MPC. Firstly, the effect of MPA on MPC differs by per capita GDP levels. Results indicated that a rise in MPA is likely to lead to increases in MPC at lower per capita GDP, specifically increases in the number of small power motorcycles, but lead to decreases in MPC once per capita GDP levels have exceeded US$3,081. However, as per capita GDP rises beyond US$44,767, an increase in MPA would lead to increases in MPC and one would expect increases in the number of high-power motorcycles. Secondly, there is a reverse U-shaped relationship between MPC and income inequality. That is, a rise in income inequality is initially accompanied by increases in MPC, but MPC decreases once per capita GDP levels have passed a specific level. Thirdly, under lower income inequality, there is a U-shaped relationship between MPC and per capita GDP, and fourthly, under higher income inequality, this relationship becomes reverse U-shaped.",1361-9209,Not found

Using 2012 Utah Travel Survey, this study is one of the rare that considers all typical categories of explanatory variables at two levels. First, a spatial probit model is estimated to identify whether and why people in Salt Lake City walked or cycled; second, for people who walked or cycled, a spatial autoregressive model is estimated to explore travel time by walking or cycling. The results not only reveal how accessibility to multi-use paths and attitudes influence active travel together but also report opposite spatial autocorrelations at two levels. These findings will help decision-makers efficiently decide strategical planning components to promote active transportation.",1361-9209,Not found
The demand for electrification in Canadian fleets: A latent class modeling approach,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102653,90,2021-01-01,2021,1,"A latent class model is estimated with revealed and stated preference data obtained from over 1000 fleet operating entities (FOEs). The model identifies four latent FOE classes,namely battery electric vehicles (BEV) leaning, EV skeptical, EV averse, and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) oriented with class probabilities of 19%, 15%, 27% and 39%, respectively. BEV leaning FOEs seem to place high value on extended trip range and are found to agree with the notion that adopting EVsis a cost-effective decision. These FOEsare also willing to install additional charging infrastructure. Corporate FOEs, relative to their governmental counterparts inICEV orientedclass are found to be more concerned with operating cost than any other cost.Policiesgeared towards investing in public charging infrastructure, launching campaigns to highlight the cost-effectiveness of EVs, incentivising FOEs with climate action plan, and encouraging on-site charging infrastructure investmentscould accelerateEV acquisition among Canadian fleets.",1361-9209,Not found
Dynamic bike sharing traffic prediction using spatiotemporal pattern detection,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102647,90,2021-01-01,2021,1,"This study proposes a two-step pattern detection methodology for dynamic bike share station traffic prediction using historic traffic and spatiotemporal characteristics. The model is developed on the 15-minute aggregated Washington, D.C. Capital Bikeshare data to predict bike share station traffic for both short- and long-term horizons ranging from 15 min to 4 h. The results show the prediction accuracy equals 100% for 15-minute, 1-hour, and 2-hour horizons and slightly more than 95% for 3-hour and 4-hour horizons at the system level. Not surprisingly, the prediction accuracy drops at the station level. For 15-minute and 1-hour horizons, the prediction accuracy equals 77% and 82%, and it ranges from 24% to 31% for 2-hour, 3-hour, and 4-hour horizons. The results also show that temporal characteristics contribute more than spatial characteristics in the short-time horizons, but the contribution is flipped for long-time horizons. The proposed models have the capacity to estimate bike share traffic for both short- and long-time horizons in less than 20 s of runtime, which illustrates the practicality of the models in dynamic bike sharing traffic prediction, and the potential of the proposed model to be updated in real-time and incorporate the most recent observations into predictions.",1361-9209,Not found
Reducing sulfur and nitrogen emissions in shipping economically,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102641,90,2021-01-01,2021,1,"The abatement technology choices are complicated by the growing ban on open-loop scrubbers, the dawn of nitrogen emission control areas (NECAs) and the current drop of fuel prices. This paper develops a model to select the optimal technology choice that meets both sulfur limits and Tier III nitrogen limits, and applies it to three feeder services. The results show that the most economic choice is installing exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) with or without scrubbers, depending on different fuel prices and characteristics of ships and shipping services. Scrubber installation is more suitable for a new ship or the one with remaining lifespan equaling the lifespan of scrubbers. However, installing EGR without scrubbers is recommended for risk-averse shipowners as it is always optimal or nearly optimal. The paper also indicates that expanding the ban on open-loop scrubbers within territorial water areas only slightly impacts the technology choices for many feeder services.",1361-9209,Not found
What drives ports around the world to adopt air emissions abatement measures?,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102644,90,2021-01-01,2021,1,"The reduction of Greenhouses gasses (GHG) and other air emissions represents a major challenge for ports. The world over, however, ports vary considerably in their efforts to reduce air emissions, and the causes for this variation remain under-researched. This paper examines the drivers for the adoption of air emissions abatement measures in a sample of 93 of the world’s largest ports, covering all continents and mobile emitters. We test five hypotheses with a Linear Probability Model to disentangle the impacts of key port characteristics on the current adoption of abatement measures and identify three key drivers for adoption: Population density, the port landlord business model, and a specialization in servicing container shipping. We also find that ports are more likely to implement specific bundles of measures, in particular combining pricing and new energy sources. Our work has implications for ports, as we suggest that they should coordinate abatement efforts to achieve effectiveness in their work.",1361-9209,Not found
Capitalisation of accessibility to dockless bike sharing in housing rentals: Evidence from Beijing,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102640,90,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Chinese cities have seen a rapid development of dockless bike sharing (DBS) in recent years. Numerous studies have examined the positive social effects of DBS, but a crucial question remains: if docklessness has successfully reworked shared bikes into a desired and valuable amenity, will unequal access to DBS affect housing rentals? The present study examines this question by considering the case of Beijing. A big data approach is employed to analyse the listed rents of 75,197 houses in Beijing and their attributes that affect housing rentals. Measurement of accessibility to DBS at the housing level is constructed from 3.2 million DBS trips generated over two weeks. Results of the hedonic model show that every one-point increase in the accessibility to DBS generates a premium worth 28.02 CNY in housing rental, thereby supporting the hypothesis that docklessness has turned DBS into a valuable amenity for renters. These findings suggest that although low- and middle-income workers benefit from the convenience of DBS in the short term, the benefits are gradually eroded and transferred to landlords through rental premiums. Unequal accessibility to DBS may induce gentrification that displaces or excludes low-income renters in certain neighbourhoods.",1361-9209,Not found
Electric scooter sharing: How do people value it as a last-mile transportation mode?,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102642,90,2021-01-01,2021,1,"With its advantages in urbanized areas, the electric scooter sharing (ESS) system has received considerable popularity as a transportation mode for short-distance trips. In this paper, people’s preferences toward ESS for last-mile trips were analyzed using a stated preference experiment. We designed the experiment to scrutinize how people value ESS-riding compared with other conventional last-mile transportation modes. The values of travel time components such as access and riding times are estimated using a mixed logit model. The values of riding transportation modes were significantly greater than that of walking for a last-mile trip. However, none of the time values of two modes—those from a conventional last-mile mode and ESS—was dominating because the difference in the dispersions of each made the time value curves intersect around their medians. Considering the results, we have concluded that ESS is a competitive transportation mode in last-mile situations.",1361-9209,Not found
Predicting bicycling and walking traffic using street view imagery and destination data,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102651,90,2021-01-01,2021,1,"Few studies predict spatial patterns of bicycling and walking across multiple cities using street-level data.

We applied machine learning algorithms to assess how well street-level variables predict bicycling and walking rates. Adding street-level variables improved out-of-sample prediction accuracy of bicycling and walking activities. We also found that street-level variables (10-fold CV R2: 0.82–0.88) may be a useful alternative to Census data (0.85–0.88). Macro-scale factors (e.g., zoning) captured by Census data and micro-scale factors (e.g., streetscapes) captured in our street-level data are both useful for predicting active travel.

Evaluating the potential environmental impacts of a large scale shift to off-hour deliveries,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102649,90,2021-01-01,2021,1,"This paper assesses the potential environmental impacts of a large-scale deployment of off-hour deliveries (OHD), focusing on CO2 and pollutant emissions. We use a methodological framework involving four steps: transport demand estimation, traffic simulation, emissions calculation and emissions environmental social cost calculation. Based on five scenarios, depending on the scale of the shift to OHD, and applied to the case of the Lyon urban area, we find that OHDs lead to a reduction in CO2 and pollutant emissions. However, their impact is rather small. The maximum reduction in CO2 emissions is 3.4% for 100% OHD for the whole urban area of Lyon (1.9 million inhabitants and 3325 km2). Some factors (population size, density, traffic conditions, research methodology, vehicle fleet composition, etc.) limit the comparability of the results obtained from other case studies. One of the reasons for this low environmental impact of OHDs is that the LUA is a small and not very congested metropolitan area. This impact is 5% when we focus on the densest area (core of area with 0.7 million inhabitants on 2.2% of surface area) which is more important than in the least dense area (outskirts of area with 0.6 million inhabitants on 83.6% of surface area) with 2.6%. These results confirm the limited impacts of OHDs in smaller, less congested urban areas. It also reaffirms the need for OHDs to be implemented in the densest parts of metropolitan areas. The maximum decrease in the environmental social cost is 4.25 million euros per year. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that the adoption of OHD makes it possible to achieve gains of 2.5 million hours per year in travel time that augur a productivity gain for all the actors involved in urban goods movement.",1361-9209,Not found
Can't drive today? The impact of driving restrictions on bikeshare ridership in Mexico City,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102652,91,2021-02-01,2021,2,"The Mexico City government has introduced policies to reduce pollution from cars, including a license-plate based driving restriction and a bikeshare. When restrictions are in place, people need to find transportation alternatives. This research leverages the random nature of driving restrictions to explore whether people use bikeshare when driving is restricted due to poor air quality. Negative binomial models were used to study these effects using data from 2016 to 2019. Results indicate that restricted days exhibit approximately 17% lower bikeshare use (10–24% decrease, 95% CI) for non-peak traffic hours compared to regular days. However, ridership increases during peak traffic hours. Morning ridership increases up to 12.5% (3–22% increase, 95% C.I) and evening ridership increases up to 16.2% (5–27.6% increase, 95% C.I). The analysis suggests that the poor environmental conditions may buffer bikeshare system use increases and that bikeshare can be a critical partner in local transportation infrastructure.",1361-9209,Not found
Exposures and health impact for bicycle and electric scooter commuters in Taipei,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102696,91,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Bicycle and scooter commuters are known to expose to more traffic-related pollutants. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BTEXs), and PM2.5 were measured along four routes during rush hour and non-rush hour periods by cyclists and motorcyclists in Taipei, Taiwan. The health impacts were also evaluated using health impact modeling (HIM) approach. The average exposures of total BTEX and PM2.5 were 20.07 ppb and 23.27 μg/m3 for the cyclists and 33.96 ppb and 27.65 μg/m3 for the motorcyclists, respectively. Riding on an “alternative” route resulted in lower exposure. Scooters could contribute more to PM2.5 exposure than buses/trucks and passenger cars. Cyclists could have a lower risk of all-cause mortality and a single-pollutant HIM was found to result in underestimations. In conclusion, the number of scooters in traffic should be reduced, and commuters should be encouraged to shift from gasoline scooters to bicycles to reduce air pollution.",1361-9209,Not found

It is unlikely that such behavior will change without significant political intervention, nor will single policy instruments be sufficient to induce the needed changes. In this study, therefore, we analyze the design of so-called disruptive policy packages required to drastically reduce passenger transport emissions in industrialized countries and illustrate it for the case of Austria. Our research approach consists of three methods: a literature review to develop a policy category system, expert interviews to build effective policy packages and a stakeholder workshop to identify the specific needs of different geographical areas. For the design of successful policy packages, we identify two critical dimensions, disruptiveness (having high-level and rapid effectiveness) and implementability.

To address the environmental challenges, the proposed concepts are either hybrid-electric or all-electric vehicles enabled with propellers that rotate at lower speeds than conventional rotorcraft configurations, such as helicopters. However, the feasibility of UAM in the near future requires significant progress on the all-electric propulsion systems since current battery technology still falls short when compared with fossil fuel in terms of specific energy density. In this work, a methodology is proposed to evaluate the environmental footprint of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft for the UAM market. This methodology is applied to existing concepts for exploratory studies on mission critical performance and environmental parameters. All-electric aircraft were found to be feasible for the UAM segment from the performance perspective. However, further improvements in battery technology and electricity generation from renewable sources are required. Sustainable aviation fuels, such as Alcohol-To-Jet (ATJ) obtained from wheat straw, present a substantially lower environmental impact than conventional fuels while providing the same performance. These biofuels also contribute less to global warming and climate changes than batteries which: (i) are recharged from electric grids still dependable on non-renewable sources; and (ii) have a low number of recharge–discharge cycles.",1361-9209,Not found
Does environmental concern promote EV sales? Duopoly pricing analysis considering consumer heterogeneity,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102695,91,2021-02-01,2021,2,"The moderating role of consumers’ environmental concern in electric vehicles (EVs) adoption intentions is well established, but the variation between intentions and behaviors leads to the necessity to consider corporate behavior and further evaluate its primary role. This paper constructs a duopoly pricing model and captures consumer heterogeneity in two dimensions to study consumers’ vehicle adoption choices and EV pricing. Counter-intuitively, the results show that environmental concerns may not always stimulate EV sales. Green consumers with environmental concerns enhance EV’s unit profitability, which may induce manufacturers to abandon conventional consumers. Thus, governments should control the phase-out rate of subsidies in markets with more green consumers to mitigate shifts in pricing strategies. Furthermore, by demonstrating the relationship between EV policies, this paper highlights the importance of policy coordination and provides specific strategies. Our findings have broad implications for understanding EV marketing under conditions of customer heterogeneity and cost-effective policy coordination strategies.",1361-9209,Not found
Workability of rubberized asphalt from a perspective of particle effect,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102712,91,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Previous studies have documented the disconnect between the rotational viscosity of asphalt rubber (AR) and the workability of AR mix. There is a possibility that the particle effect of crumb rubber modifier (CRM) particles within AR causes this phenomenon. This study measured the viscosities of ARs and the corresponding liquid phases at three temperatures. The workability of the corresponding AR mixes was evaluated using the number of gyrations of Superpave Gyratory Compactor (SGC) samples. The changes on AR caused by the CRM contents were measured using Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) test. The experimental results revealed that the rotational viscosity of the AR liquid phase is more suitable to be used as a workability indicator. In addition, thresholds of CRM content were reported. Once the threshold is exceeded, the increase in AR viscosity is only caused by the increase in CRM particle effect and there is no detectable CRM/asphalt interaction.",1361-9209,Not found

Characterization of commercial vehicles’ start-up operations from in-use data,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102694,91,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Diesel engines produce disproportionate levels of emissions when the engine and after-treatment systems are operating at low temperatures. This situation arises most commonly when the vehicle is first started after overnight. To quantify emissions attributable to vehicle starts, a sizable collection of on-road commercial vehicle operating data is analyzed to identify start-up events and inspect associated emissions. Data was obtained from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) Fleet DNA and from the Center for Environmental Research & Technology (CE-CERT). Included are 500 + diesel vehicles with more than 42,000 recorded days, drawn from 25 vocational categories across the United States. Analysis shows that vehicle behavior, in terms of engine cold- and warm-operation, starts per day, soak time, and warm-up duration, differs significantly between vehicle vocations. Also, weighting factors for cold- and hot-starts currently used in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Federal Test Procedure (FTP) for heavy-duty emissions certification accurately represent real-world operations. Although the FTP includes a comparable fraction of cold operation, the hot fraction is much shorter than real-world operation due to limited test duration. The investigation also revealed that real-world engines operate for a significant amount of time when the engine coolant is in the “hot-stabilized” region, but the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) temperature is below its effective operating temperature of 200 °C. Of the vehicles under investigation, almost 20% of their operational time is within this condition.

Trend analysis, analysis of variance and binary logistic regression were used to compare emission levels and to estimate the probability of compliance to emission standards. The results showed that emission levels for carbon monoxide and oxygen increased by 2% and hydrocarbon levels doubled with the age of the vehicle. Older vehicles also show a lean mixture in the air to fuel ratio calculation. Vehicles falling within a heavier weight class emit more CO2. Probability models showed that compliance to European and national standards decrease as much as 30% with age and use of the vehicles. Older commercial vehicles falling into a heavy weight class has the lowest probability of compliance with any of the emissions policies assessed.

In particular, time-dependency of CO2 emission was considered with physical decay to increase the accuracy in estimating cumulative radiative forcing. It was found that warming temperatures would lead to faster structural deterioration of pavement, resulting in earlier or more frequent overlay treatments. Pavement rehabilitation treatments generate more CO2 emission in material and construction related stages but cause the reduction of CO2 emission in pavement use phase.

Integrated modelling of autonomous electric vehicle diffusion: From review to conceptual design,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102679,91,2021-02-01,2021,2,"The future Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are likely to be electric. We started with a review of the adoption of AVs, Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Autonomous Electric Vehicles (AEVs), as well as the six associated urban sub-systems, namely transportation, land use, environment, energy, economy, and population systems, in order to find evidence about the linkages and interactions between the diffusion of AEVs and the six sub-systems. Based on the review, we argued that an integrated urban model, which takes the linkages and interactions into account, was needed to fully understand the adoption and impacts of AEVs. Furthermore, we conducted a conceptual design of an integrated model for AEVs (without explicit modelling), and demonstrated how to update an existing agent-based Land Use and Transport Interaction (LUTI) model by incorporating AEV components. The resulting integrated model of AEVs would help different AEV-related stakeholders (e.g., local authorities) in their decision-making.",1361-9209,Not found
Photocatalytic degradation of vehicular exhaust by nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide modified pavement material,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102690,91,2021-02-01,2021,2,"The increasing number of motor vehicles on roads is correspondingly augmenting obnoxious aerial exhaust pollution. Herein, this study reports the introduction of nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (N-TiO2) as new pavement materials with enhanced photocatalytic degradation efficiency for vehicular exhaust. The structure and bandgap of the prepared N-TiO2 were simulated in Cambridge sequential total energy package (CASTEP) and verified by microscopic experiments (X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope, Ultraviolet (UV)–visible diffuse reflectance spectra). Meanwhile, this study evaluated its photocatalytic degradation efficiency in tests using carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxide (NO) as model exhaust fumes with various operating parameters optimized. In the end, the suitability of photocatalytic exhaust gas degradation fog sealing technique was compared to three pavement grades (stone mastic asphalt-13, asphalt concrete-13, and open-graded friction course-13), and the results showed that the N-TiO2 is more suitable for stone mastic asphalt pavement.",1361-9209,Not found

We take advantage of this policy change to identify the effect of the application of an LEZ on NO2 concentrations. Our findings provide evidence that the introduction of Madrid LEZ has had a positive impact on reducing NO2 emissions, as measured by Plaza del Carmen’s monitoring station. Furthermore, monitoring stations located near to Madrid LEZ also exhibit significant, though smaller, reductions in NO2 levels. These results suggest that there was a positive spillover effect and that pollution was not transferred from the city centre to other nearby areas. Instead, it seems that citizens in Madrid actually changed their transportation habits.",1361-9209,Not found
Air pollutant emissions from Piraeus port: External costs and air quality levels,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102586,91,2021-02-01,2021,2,"Navigation emissions are an important component of the national emission inventories as they represent a significant part of total NOx, SOx and particulate matter emissions as well as of GHG emissions (mainly CO2). Although emissions from ships at berth are an important source of atmospheric pollutants in dense urban agglomerations, worsening thus air quality conditions of port cities, there is still a significant lack of data and uncertainty in port emissions calculations. Moreover, according to the OECD, most shipping emissions in ports are expected to considerably increase up to 2050. In the last decade, Piraeus port activities have known a significant increase, especially regarding commercial ships. In this context, detailed emission calculations from Piraeus port activities were conducted, external costs were estimated and air pollutant dispersion was simulated through the use of appropriate atmospheric models. Total annual port emissions were compared to previous works. Since 2008, passenger port emissions have witnessed an increase mostly in NOx due to the increased number of ship calls, whereas SOx emissions have been decreasing significantly as a result of the significant decrease of S content in fuel used. The anticipated external costs due to health and other damages ship emissions impose, reach to 23.7Μ€. Finally, air pollutants’ concentration levels due to the operation of the port for the scenario with maximum emissions and meteorological conditions favouring pollutant accumulation were estimated.",1361-9209,Not found

Artificial neural network (ANN) based high-fidelity microscopic (1 Hz) and mesoscopic (5–60 min) fuel consumption models were developed for hybrid buses. The microscopic model contained 1 Hz driving, grade, and environment variables. The mesoscopic model aggregated 1 Hz data into 5 to 60-minute traffic pattern factors and predicted average fuel consumption over its duration. The prediction results show mean absolute percentage errors of 1–2% for microscopic models and 5–8% for mesoscopic models.

Sustainable road design through multi-objective optimization: A case study in Northeast India,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102594,91,2021-02-01,2021,2,"The development of a sustainable road network in Northeast India is challenging due to the rough terrain, inclement weather, budgetary constraints, and lack of skilled workforce, among other factors. Since the sustainable development of roads involves balancing multiple goals and limitations, in this work, a hybrid multi-objective optimization model was developed by integrating the multi-objective particle swarm optimization with the crowd distance technique and the K-means clustering strategy. The application of the proposed approach was demonstrated by designing a road suitable for Northeast India. The proposed model generated sustainable designs by optimizing the budgetary and environmental limits and workforce competence. The results indicated that multiple optimization techniques can be incorporated in the design of sustainable highways in Northeast India.

New simple-to-operate, low-cost sensing technologies are a potential solution to this problem. To assess their suitability, we deployed six Sensit Real-time, Affordable, Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) monitors measuring PM2.5, NO, NO2, CO2, O3 and CO in three parking garages on the UBC Vancouver campus from April–August 2019. UBC Parking Services provided real-time vehicle counts to help validate our method. After sensor calibration, integrated pollutant and CO2 signals were converted to fuel-based emission factors (EFs). Our calculated EFs fell within the range of previous studies. Evening EFs when vehicles were cold were 10–50% higher than in the morning. We also observed a disproportional contribution of high emitters; the top 25% of plumes contributed 45–65% of total emissions.

For the investigation, the data were collected in Seoul, Korea, and a latent class adjacent-category ordinal logit model was estimated. The results show that the respondents could be divided into two groups. One group comprises those who tend to prefer to use the ESS service for commuting, and the other group involves those who tend to prefer the service for the first-mile and last-mile trip. According to the estimated class membership characteristics, the members involved in the first group tend to be younger, higher earners and less satisfied with the current public transportation than the other members who are associated with the second group.

Herein, the vehicle platoon behavior in the scenario of driving through a signalized intersection exhibits great benefits for sustainability which is even improved along corridors with more traffic lights. In the velocity trajectory planning process, a modified dynamic programming algorithm is formulated with the switching logic gate of two types of optimal control problems to increase the computational speed. By testing in the real-world scenario, the results of the proposed Eco-CACC demonstrate excellent energy performance which improves 8.02% compared to manual driving with the constant acceleration policy. Moreover, energy can be further improved by 2.02% and 1.55% when the car-following strategy is selected with MPC and IDM algorithm.",1361-9209,Not found
Multivariate and location-specific correlates of fuel consumption: A test track study,10.1016/j.trd.2020.102627,92,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Current predictors of fuel consumption are typically based on computer simulations or data collections in real traffic, where the route and vehicle type are not under the researcher’s control. Here, we predicted fuel consumption using test track data, an approach that allowed for location-specific predictions. Ninety-one drivers drove a total of 4617 laps, in two vehicles (Renault Mégane, Renault Clio), on two routes (highway and mountain), and with two eco-driving instructions (normal and eco). A multivariate analysis at the level of laps showed a strong predictive value for metrics related to speed, RPM, and throttle position, but with a considerable amount of variance attributable to route and vehicle type. A subsequent location-specific analysis showed that the predictive correlation of driving speed and throttle position fluctuated strongly during the lap and at some locations even became negative.

I find evidence that an increase in the supply of rail transport leads to less congestion, less travel time and less pollution. Furthermore, cities with a new rail system have on average 7% less congestion, 1% less travel time and 3% less pollution than cities with no rail systems.

We propose a “3A + 3S” framework to describe the perceived built environment related to feeder trip by DBS. By analyzing data from a questionnaire survey in Shenzhen, China, we reveal that (1) the perceptions toward the accessibility of metro stations and ease of searching/parking bikes notably increase the odds of DBS–metro integration; (2) the effects of certain perceived built environment features differ across scenarios. Perceived intersection is a barrier factor only for evening egress trips; the perceived bicycle–pedestrian crashes tend to discourage home-side integration; and the perceived bikeways promote integrated use except for the evening egress scenario; and (3) the effects of perceived land use and POIs on the DBS–metro integration are less than expected.",1361-9209,Not found

We analyze trip origins and destinations for shared e-scooter use at the street-segment level. Street segments are a relevant unit for policy analysis because users park scooters along the streets' curbside, and parking policies target specific street segments. We build Hurdle models for trip origins and destinations using data from Washington DC in 2019. Results show that street segments near tourist sites, hotels, and transit stops attract the most scooter-trip destinations. In contrast, the supply of available e-scooters is the dominant force shaping scooter-trip origins. We find preliminary evidence to suggest that scooters are complementing public transit. Like other studies, we find that areas with younger and more educated demographics correlate with higher e-scooter use. Finally, we demonstrate that the model can identify segments with a high demand for scooter parking.",1361-9209,Not found
Planning car-lite neighborhoods: Does bikesharing reduce auto-dependence?,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102721,92,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Bike enthusiasts argue that bikesharing programs can be an important element of sustainable mobility planning in the urban cores of large metropolitan areas. However, the objective long-term impact of bikesharing on reducing auto-dependence is not well-examined, as prior studies have tended to rely on self-reported subjective mode substitution effects. We use a unique longitudinal dataset containing millions of geo-referenced vehicle registrations and odometer readings in Massachusetts over a six-year period - the Massachusetts Vehicle Census - to examine the causal impact of bikesharing on various metrics of auto-dependence in the inner core of Metro Boston. The difference-in-differences (DiD) framework is extended to accommodate spatial spillover effects with the inclusion of a spatial autoregressive lag leading to the spatial DiD (SpDiD) model. We also account for seasonal variation in bikeshare operations, where several stations are shut down for the winter months, by setting up a dynamic treatment definition. We find that a new bikeshare station reduces vehicle ownership per household by 2.2%, vehicle miles traveled per person by 3.3%, and per-capita vehicular GHG emissions by 2.9%. We also find strong evidence to support the use of bikesharing as a first/last-mile connector to mass transit. Auto-dependence reductions are around 10% (more than thrice as high as average) where bikeshare connections to transit stations are less than one kilometer long. Finally, we find that vehicle ownership reductions are almost immediate and last up to a year, while vehicle use and emission reductions are lagged over 1.5 years. These sizeable and measurable auto-substitution effects do support some of the claims of bikesharing advocates. These findings are especially important in the post-COVID-19 era, as cities strive to counter the pandemic-inspired safety skepticism about non-car travel.",1361-9209,Not found
Effects of semi-trailer modifications on HGV fuel consumption,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102717,92,2021-03-01,2021,3,"This article investigates the effects of aerodynamic and lightweight double-deck semi-trailers on fuel consumption of Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs). The HGVs were evaluated using in-service data, and computer-based simulations with coefficients of aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance estimated from coast-down tests conducted on a test track. The coast-down tests showed that the aerodynamic features reduced the coefficient of aerodynamic drag by approximately 7.2 % and the wide single tyres on the lightweight trailers reduced the coefficient of rolling resistance by approximately 10%. The in-service data showed that the aerodynamic features on the aerodynamic vehicles have a statistical significance on fuel consumption. Computer-based simulations showed that the aerodynamic-lightweight trailer reduces the HGV’s fuel consumption by approximately 20.2 % for a long-haul drive cycle. As these improvements don’t have significant barrier to implementation, which is the case with electrification of HGVs, fleet operators can employ these improvements to reduce their carbon emissions.",1361-9209,Not found
The role of micro-mobility in shaping sustainable cities: A systematic literature review,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102734,92,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Micro-mobility is increasingly recognised as a promising mode of urban transport, particularly for its potential to reduce private vehicle use for short-distance travel. Despite valuable research contributions that represent fundamental knowledge on this topic, today’s body of research appears quite fragmented in relation to the role of micro-mobility as a transformative solution for meeting sustainability outcomes in urban environments. This paper consolidates knowledge on the topic, analyses past and on-going research developments, and provides future research directions by using a rigorous and auditable systematic literature review methodology. To achieve these objectives, the paper analysed 328 journal publications from the Scopus database covering the period between 2000 and 2020. A bibliographic analysis was used to identify relevant publications and explore the changing landscape of micro-mobility research. The study constructed and visualised the literature’s bibliometric networks through citations and co-citations analyses for authors, articles, journals and countries. The findings showed a consistent spike in recent research outputs covering the sustainability aspects of micro-mobility reflecting its importance as a low-carbon and transformative mode of urban transport. The co-citation analysis, in particular, helped to categorise the literature into four main research themes that address benefits, technology, policy and behavioural mode-choice categories where the majority of research has been focused during the analysis period. For each cluster, inductive reasoning is used to discuss the emerging trends, barriers as well as pathways to overcome challenges to wide-scale deployment.

To empirically assess the effectiveness of the three mechanisms, a case study based on Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan regional low-carbon logistics network design is investigated. The findings show that the performance of the conditional-budget-sharing mechanism is superior to the non-budget-sharing mechanism, but inferior to the centralized-budget-sharing mechanism.

The real-time fuel consumption and emissions of the transit bus configurations are calculated by dynamic vehicle simulation using Simcenter Amesim software. By considering the effect of road gradient, a 12% difference in computed fuel consumption is shown for bus travel in the two opposing directions of the bus line. The results also reveal that the majority of life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are associated with on-board emissions.

While early BEV owners differed from other car owners, over time BEV owners have become more similar to other car owners.

Urban transportation at an inflection point: An analysis of potential influencing factors,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102733,92,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Urban transportation is in the midst of a two-fold transformation: On the one hand, cities are beginning to acknowledge their climate responsibilities and are seeking to establish environmentally-friendly, sustainable transport systems. On the other hand, new transportation trends, such as shared mobility and autonomous driving, carry the potential to disruptively change conventional practices. In this study, we develop an activity-based transport demand model to quantify the effects of potential influencing factors on urban transportation in a synthetic city. We develop 18 scenarios to investigate urban transportation against the backdrop of mode availability, the deployment of shared mobility services, urban structure and societal change, such as urbanization and an aging population, as well as behavioral shifts in mode choice preferences. With respect to the results, we highlight the derived modal split for a city without private cars but with access to shared autonomous vehicles for all agents: We find a distribution of mode choices of 55% for walking and biking, 40% for public transportation and 5% for shared modes. Given this modal split, the total driven distance, as well as the total number of vehicles in the city, decreases by over 90% against current levels. Thus, an efficient future urban transport system should build upon public transportation for meeting the major share of transport demand, with slow modes for convenient travel across short distances and shared mobility for the intermodal connection of both.",1361-9209,Not found

The analysis performed using an establishment-based freight survey dataset from Kerala, a coastal state in India, revealed five latent classes of fleet ownership. The determinants of freight transport emissions and the gross emitters in fleet segments are presented subsequently by analyzing how the establishment-level characteristics (employment, business age, industry sector, value density, and relative location) explain the variation in CO2 emissions.

The findings suggest that haze pollution and its changes are important triggers of life satisfaction. Moreover, the effects of changes in haze pollution correlate with basic haze pollution levels. Active commuters report higher life satisfaction, while transit commuters report lower life satisfaction. Longer commutes cause losses in life satisfaction. Additionally, haze pollution mitigates the losses in life satisfaction for commuters using public transit, but strengthens the negative effect of commuting time.",1361-9209,Not found

We address the case of a medium-size city in a developing country like Argentina, which shares characteristics with other Latin American cities. The result of synthesizing experiences carried out in the city of Puerto Madryn, Patagonia Argentina is presented. The use of different instruments throughout various territorial actions allowed us to evaluate the social feasibility of implementing urban cycling policies in the city. Those instruments used were a specially designed mobile application for cyclists and two surveys that cover the cyclist’s profile and behavioral aspects towards cycling, respectively. The three of them have the common characteristics of being low-cost and simple to implement. The resulting social feasibility analysis reflects the importance of citizens’ commitment to cycling mobility. This analysis also gives an idea of the efforts needed to implement a policy in that regard. The results obtained indicate a high level of willingness to cycling, particularly among women. Family and friends support appears as a strength. Although infrastructure emerges as an important issue, it is not considered as urgent as other initiatives like safety driving campaigns, bicycle commuting programs and low infrastructure cost parking places.

Specifically, E-Scooter user guidelines of 156 cities were explored. A multifaceted analysis was conducted to characterize the distinct features of E-Scooter user guidelines. A total of sixteen key attributes were identified and two categorizing procedures were implemented in the analysis. The comparative results show the completeness of information and similarities between cities. We conclude that municipalities should introduce more actionable guidelines driven by quantitative performance metrics.",1361-9209,Not found
Temporal pattern of moose-vehicle collisions,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102715,92,2021-03-01,2021,3,"Wildlife-vehicle collisions have become an increasing problem in recent decades as they seriously affect both animals and road users, leading to fatalities, substantial economic losses, and high biodiversity costs. We used GPS tracking of 37 moose, traffic volume, weather conditions, and information on moose-vehicle collisions (MVCs) reported on the Internet to explain the temporal patterns of MVCs in Poland from 2003 to 2019. MVCs peaked in early autumn (September-October). In all seasons, the greatest MVC risk occurred during the few hours after dusk, while in early autumn, MVC risk was also elevated during the hours preceding dawn. Moose activity was the strongest positive predictor of MVCs, but moose presence near roads, traffic volume, fogginess, and lack of precipitation were also positively correlated with MVC risk. We conclude that introducing seasonally adjusted measures (e.g. speed limitations, temporary warning signs) could substantially reduce the number of MVCs.",1361-9209,Not found

Exploring satisfaction of choice and captive bus riders: An impact asymmetry analysis,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102798,93,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The literature offers ample evidence on the associations between transit attributes and rider satisfaction. However, their asymmetric relationships are often overlooked. Few studies emphasize the attributes critical to choice and captive riders in developing countries. This study employs an impact asymmetry analysis to explore the correlates of bus satisfaction of choice and captive riders in Harbin, China. Most service attributes have asymmetric associations with overall satisfaction of both choice and captive riders. The waiting area, driver’s operating behavior, complaint handling, and stop announcement are critical to overall satisfaction of both choice and captive riders. However, planners should know that, because of the asymmetricity, planning goals differ when trying to satisfy choice and captive riders. Furthermore, they should emphasize convenience and comfort to satisfy captive riders and focus on bus availability to incentivize choice riders. Future studies should consider the non-linear associations and investigate the varying needs of different population groups.",1361-9209,Not found
Increasing costs to Chinese railway infrastructure by extreme precipitation in a warmer world,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102797,93,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The increase in extreme weather events associated with global warming has posed a global challenge for infrastructure. However, our current knowledge on the impact of climate change on infrastructure is quite limited. Here, by analyzing the historical rainfall induced disaster data of Chinese railways from 1981 to 2016, we demonstrate that the rainfall-induced disaster risk of railway infrastructure has increased with increasing extreme rainfall days. Following global warming of 1.5 °C/2 °C/3 °C under RCP8.5, the proportion of railway infrastructure under high disaster susceptibility is projected to increase by ~2.8/4.0/6.7-fold compared to that of the baseline period (1981–1998). Limiting global warming to 1.5 °C would save economic losses by approximately $0.63 and $2.06 billion per year compared to those under warmings of 2 °C and 3 °C, respectively. This study implies the necessity and benefit of limiting global warming to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 °C in the context of infrastructure.",1361-9209,Not found
How to measure the impacts of shared automated electric vehicles on urban mobility,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102766,93,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The arrival of new technologies and innovations on mobility, such as automated vehicles, creates opportunities to tackle urban challenges. The evaluation of the impacts of these innovations on the mobility system requires a comprehensive set of criteria and parameters. This article proposes a method to measure the impacts of Shared Automated Electric Vehicles (SAEV) on mobility through a sustainability assessment. Based on an integrative literature study and on the context of AVENUE, a European project deploying automated shuttles in the public transport of European cities, a set of indicators is defined. These mobility indicators assess the social, environmental, economic, governance, and technical impacts of SAEV. The multiple dimensions of the mobility indicators contribute to filling gaps of knowledge about the performance of SAEV. The proposed method allows an evaluation and comparison of SAEV to other means of transport and thus strengthens scientifically based recommendations for transportation policies.",1361-9209,Not found
The role of urban form in the performance of shared automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102744,93,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The technology of Shared Automated Vehicles (SAVs) has advanced significantly in recent years. However, existing SAV studies primarily focus on the system design, while limited studies have examined the impacts of exogenous variables, especially urban form, on SAV performance. Therefore, it remains unclear what key urban form measurements may influence SAV systems’ sustainability. This study fills the research gap by conducting simulation experiments using data collected from 286 cities. This study identifies critical urban form measurements correlated with the simulated SAV performance using fixed effects regression models. The results suggest that SAVs are more efficient and generate less VMT in denser cities with more connected networks and diversified land use development patterns. The model results can provide insights on land use and transportation policies to curb the adverse effects of SAVs in the future and generalize existing SAV simulation results to the rest of U.S. cities.",1361-9209,Not found

Equitable? Exploring ridesourcing waiting time and its determinants,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102774,93,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Waiting time (WT) is an important measure that can reflect accessibility to ridesourcing service. Previous studies explored the effects of built environment factors on WT based on estimated WT but did not control for trip-level characteristics, which may lead to biased parameter estimation. Thus, we further study this topic by using the actual WT recorded by the RideAustrin platform and considering trip-level variables. The single-level and multilevel proportional hazards models are constructed, and model comparison shows that the multilevel model performs better. We find that waiting time is positively correlated with trip-level characteristics such as traffic conditions, surge multiplier, and rainy weather. Regarding built environment factors, WT is positively related to distance to CBD and negatively related to road density, transit stop density, and land-use entropy. WT is also higher in areas with a high fraction of Hispanic/Latino and Black residents but lower in areas of low income.",1361-9209,Not found

Our motivation is the contrast between high support for air travel restrictions responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and low support for restrictions to combat climate change. Can the same factors explain individuals’ support for restrictive measures across two different problems? Using a survey, we find that largely the same factors explain support. Support increases with expected effectiveness, perceived threat and imminence of the problem, shorter expected duration of the measure, knowledge, and trust, while support decreases with expected negative consequences for self and the poor. When controlling for all perceptions, there is no significant residual difference in support depending on whether the measures address climate change or COVID-19. The level of support differs because COVID-19 is perceived as a more imminent threat, and because measures are expected to be shorter-lasting and more effective.",1361-9209,Not found
Capturing diversity in electric vehicle charging behaviour for network capacity estimation,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102762,93,2021-04-01,2021,4,"This paper proposes a stochastic data-driven model for uncontrolled charging that accurately captures diversity in individual consumer behaviour. This is important because understanding the diversity between consumers is necessary to accurately estimate the number of electric vehicles’ charging a distribution network could support without reinforcements. The model combines readily available travel survey data with high resolution data from an electric vehicle trial, using clustering and conditional probabilities. We demonstrate through a case study of UK residential charging that existing approaches may overestimate the increase in peak distribution network demand by 50%, which has implications for assessing the cost of network investments required. We also show that the peak charging demand varies regionally from 0.2–1.4 kW per household, demonstrating the importance of using locally representative vehicle usage data.",1361-9209,Not found

However, the current ratio of ridesplitting in the ridesourcing services is relatively low and its influencing factors remain unrevealed. Therefore, this paper uses a machine learning method, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model, to explore the nonlinear effects of built environment on the ridesplitting ratio of origin–destination pairs (census tract to census tract). The GBDT model also provides the relative importance ranking of all the built environment factors. The results indicate that distance to city center, land use diversity and road density are the key influencing factors of ridesplitting ratio. In addition, the non-linear thresholds of built environment factors are identified based on partial dependence plots, which could provide policy implications for the government and transportation network companies to promote ridesplitting.",1361-9209,Not found

Propensity score methods were applied to balance treatment and control groups, effectively reducing the selection bias that potentially confounds the causal effects. This study finds that occasional bicycling was not significantly associated with mental health, while regular bicycling was negatively associated with psychological distress and positively associated with life satisfaction. This study also finds that physical activity levels, physical health conditions, and neighborhood physical environment do not fully mediate the effects of utilitarian bicycling on mental wellbeing.

Following a framework with three sequential evaluation stages, decision-makers systematically assessed the attributes based on each evaluation stage’s specific criteria. Thereafter, we aggregated the decision-makers’ input values using a combination of compensatory and non-compensatory Multi-Attribute Decision-Making techniques. Results offer a ranked list of attributes and a recommended set of attributes for Tehran’s road network as our case study. The findings suggest six attributes to be included in road network disaster recovery planning as 1) access level to service-providing nodes, 2) integration of link travel delay and traffic flow, 3) travel time improvement per recovery duration, 4) travel time improvement per resources, 5) centrality measures, and 6) link capacity. However, the recommended attributes are valid only when they remain as a set. Results contribute to the existing knowledge about concerns and values in the reconstruction and recovery of transportation networks after disasters.

This article deals with the question of how the required shares of alternative vehicles can be achieved by the year 2050. In literature the preferred technology are battery electric vehicles as these are more energy efficient than hydrogen vehicles. To be able to demonstrate how alternative vehicles diffuse into the German market, the passenger car investment behavior of private persons was investigated. For this purpose, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) with 1921 participants was carried out empirically. The results of the DCE show that the investment costs in particular are important when choosing a vehicle. This is followed by the driving range, fuel costs and vehicle type. Less important are the charging infrastructure and CO2 emissions of the vehicle. A CO2 tax is of least importance. The utility values of the DCE were used to simulate future market shares. For this purpose the open-source software Inve2st was developed and different scenarios were defined and calculated. This paper shows that conservative assumptions on attribute development leave a large gap until full electrification, as conventional vehicles still account for around 62% of market shares in 2050. In order to achieve full electrification, extreme efforts must be made, targeting the technical and economic characteristics of the vehicles, but also addressing person-related characteristics such as level of information, the subjective norm or the technological risk attitude. A ban on new registrations of combustion engines from 2030 could also lead to a full electrification by 2050. An average annual increase in the market share of alternative vehicles of 2.4 percentage points is needed to achieve full electrification.

In this study, an extended theory of planned behaviour has been proposed to study the factors that influence the adoption of battery electric vehicles in Indian context. Analysis has been performed using factor-based regression technique and results revealed that attitude is found to be the strongest predictor. Moreover, the impact of knowledge of maintenance and perceived technology was explored on purchase intention of Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV). Also, a mediation analysis has been performed to determine its significance. Results revealed that knowledge of maintenance did not have any direct effects, but showed significant indirect effects, whereas the perceived technology had a pronounced impact with significant direct and indirect effects on purchase intentions.

Material stock quantification and environmental impact analysis of urban road systems,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102756,93,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Road construction area expands rapidly in China which challenges the conservations of natural resources. While available studies largely focused on consumptions at project level, this study integrated material flow analysis and life cycle assessment methods to quantify the material stocks and environmental impacts of urban road system. Remote sensing images were processed to extract road network skeletons. Taking Nanjing as an example, the results show that: 1) arterial road stores the largest amount of materials (42.9 million tons) of entire road system; 2) macadam occupies nearly 80% of total material stocks; 3) increase of road class coincides with the increase of material stock per unit area and enhances the material utilization efficiency; 4) arterial road is over-emphasized and expressway is still of a small scale in Nanjing.

Effectiveness of battery electric vehicle promotion on particulate matter emissions reduction,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102758,93,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Quantifying environmental benefits from battery electric vehicles (BEVs) requires an understanding of the long-term substitutional relationships among different vehicle technologies. This study analyzes how BEV promotion can contribute to reductions in particulate matter (PM) emissions in Korea and investigates effective long-term policy options. Using a choice model, this study simulates consumers’ vehicle replacement behavior under various policy scenarios from 2018 to 2025. The results show that BEV promotion alone has limited effectiveness at reducing PM emissions because BEV purchases were predominantly made by gasoline vehicle owners while diesel vehicles are the key source of emissions. This finding is significant because investment in BEV promotion in Korea specifies PM emissions reductions as their core objective and legal basis. Investigation of additional policy options suggests that the combination of direct regulations on diesel vehicles and a targeted rebate to promote substitution between diesel vehicles and BEVs can reduce PM emissions by ~13%.",1361-9209,Not found
Environmental performance of shared micromobility and personal alternatives using integrated modal LCA,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102743,93,2021-04-01,2021,4,"The environmental performance of shared micromobility services compared to private alternatives has never been assessed using an integrated modal Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) relying on field data.

Global warming potential, primary energy consumption, and the three endpoint damages are calculated. Sensitivity analyses on vehicle lifespan, shipping, servicing distance, and electricity mix are conducted. Electric micromobility ranks between active modes and personal ICE modes. Its impacts are globally driven by the vehicle manufacturing. Ownership does not affect directly the environmental performance: the vehicle lifetime mileage does. Assessing the sole carbon footprint leads to biased environmental decision-making, as it is not correlated to the three damages: multicriteria LCA is mandatory to preserve the planet.

Are Individuals’ stated preferences for electric vehicles (EVs) consistent with real-world EV ownership patterns?,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102728,93,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Previous studies on factors affecting electric vehicle (EV) adoption mainly rely on individual stated preference surveys or aggregate market share analyses. This paper applies both approaches to study EV adoption patterns in the state of Virginia to compare and contrast findings from the two methods. An individual-level vehicle fuel type choice model is developed based on a 2018 stated preference survey of 837 Virginia drivers. A county-level EV ownership model is developed using Department of Motor Vehicles’ 2012–2016 vehicle registration data. Results show several consistent findings: 1) being male and having higher educational attainment have positive effects on EV adoption; 2) availability of DC fast charging stations is positively associated with EV adoption, particularly for battery electric vehicles (BEVs). However, the age effects are found to be inconsistent between the two study approaches: older individuals state negative preferences for EVs whereas counties with greater share of older populations are associated with more EV registrations. Additionally, the individual vehicle choice model complements the county-level EV ownership analysis by examining the effects of various vehicle-related attributes: 1) model results show positive effects of EV purchase incentives but negligible effects of EV annual use fees on EV preferences; 2) battery range is found to be significant for the utility of BEVs, but not for plug-in hybrid EVs; and 3) EV owners place greater importance on battery range and DC fast charging stations than non-EV owners. The combined analysis confirms several influential factors of EV adoption, and identifies instances when stated preference/interest are not consistent with real-world ownership patterns, which should be explicitly considered in EV policy making.",1361-9209,Not found
Well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions of heavy-duty transports: Influence of electricity carbon intensity,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102757,93,2021-04-01,2021,4,"There are several alternatives for how to phase out diesel in heavy-duty transports, thereby reducing the sector’s climate change impact. This paper assesses the well-to-wheel (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of energy carriers for heavy-duty vehicles, analyzing the effect of the carbon intensity of the electricity used in production. The results show that energy carriers with high electricity dependence are not necessarily better than diesel from a WTW perspective. In particular, fuels produced through electrolysis are not well suited in carbon-intense electricity systems. Conversely, waste-based biofuels have low GHG emissions regardless of the electricity system. Battery-electric buses show a large reduction of GHG emissions compared to diesel buses and many other alternatives, while battery-electric trucks have higher GHG emissions than diesel in carbon intense electricity systems. Thus, electrifying transports or switching to renewable fuels will not suffice if the electricity system is not made renewable first.",1361-9209,Not found

We shed light on both monetary and non-monetary barriers to EV usage by exploiting the feature that variable costs are identical for shared vehicles but different for private car owners across engine types. While drivers respond to monetary incentives when using conventional cars, this does not hold for EVs. We find that EVs are, on average, driven shorter distances than conventional vehicles, both in terms of annual and single-day mileage, even if costs are identical. We also document that car sharing intensifies the usage of conventional cars but not that of EVs.",1361-9209,Not found

Regression modeling was used to determine the influential variables and their contribution to generated noise level at signalized T-intersections, cross-intersections, and roundabouts. The results showed that number of vehicles, and pavement condition index and speed together with the total traffic volume have significant impacts on the noise level.

The question arises as to how the degree and the order of more and less impeding route sections influence experienced utility of routes. On driving simulator routes, participants were assigned one out of two mean speeds and one out of three segmentations (i.e., “Fast Slow,” “Constant,” and “Slow Fast”). Independent of assigned mean speed, routes with the segmentation “Slow Fast” were rated less arousing, more positive, faster and more flowing than routes with the segmentation “Fast Slow.” Further differences were revealed by an interaction between mean speed and route segmentation. In summary, optimized segmentation can increase the utility of impeded routes. This may increase the acceptance of traveler information systems and in turn subjective well-being due to more efficient travel. The study warrants further investigations of varying driving cycles under real-world conditions.",1361-9209,Not found
Assessing travel satisfaction in public transport: A configurational approach,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102732,93,2021-04-01,2021,4,"Previous findings have established that satisfaction with public transport service quality attributes (reliability/functionality, information, courtesy/simplicity, comfort, safety) relate to overall travel satisfaction. Recent studies propose that the importance of these attributes for travel satisfaction varies in different contexts and call for new approaches for enhancing the understanding of these relationships. We address this call by using a configurational perspective and applying fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), to explore how satisfaction with service quality attributes relate to high travel satisfaction. By analyzing user survey data before and after an intervention in public transport services in a Swedish city, we: 1) find that high travel satisfaction occurs in the interaction between service quality attributes; 2) identify different configurations of satisfaction with service quality attributes leading to high travel satisfaction; and 3) show how context alters overall travel satisfaction.

The study considers data from a recent survey conducted in Medina, Saudi Arabia. Analyses are based on a stated-preference (SP) survey in conjunction with spatial analysis approaches. SP results show that 53% of participants are willing to shift to PT, with no spatial autocorrelation existing between the participants’ willingness to use PT and their residential zones. Logistic regression indicates that participants who used PT abroad are more likely to shift whenever PT becomes available in their city. Equally, gender and vehicular occupancy rate determine participants’ intention to shift to PT.

Infrastructure development is conducive to reducing transport emissions. However, decision making regarding the development of port-hinterland transport infrastructures is complicated because port throughputs for different types of cargo change with economic structural changes (ESCs) in the port’s hinterland. Therefore, this study develops a hybrid econometric and system dynamic model to explore the impact of ESCs in the hinterland on a port’s throughput and to formulate suitable infrastructure decisions to reduce CO2 emissions from port-hinterland transport. The hybrid model is applied to the Qingdao port and its hinterland transport in Shandong Province, China. The results show that long-term CO2 emissions from port-hinterland transport will increase significantly because Shandong’s ESCs will lead to a notable increase in the freight volume of containers, despite a concurrent decrease in the freight volume of iron ore. To reduce port-hinterland transport emissions under ESCs, facilitating railway transport for containers prioritizes over other options. The results also reveal that whether the ESCs are considered will lead to different infrastructure decisions, and whether life-cycle emissions of infrastructure are considered may lead to different priorities of infrastructure options. The findings indicate that holistic view and collaboration among government entities and transport-related stakeholders should be emphasized in the decision making of transport infrastructure development.",1361-9209,Not found

Results show that annual losses due to shadowing may reach 25% for roads and over 50% for urban parking spaces. Nevertheless, despite these losses, the annual solar extended range for onboard solar vehicles is between 10 and 18 km/day/kWp, thus significantly reducing charging needs.",1361-9209,Not found
Low-cost emissions cuts in container shipping: Thinking inside the box,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102815,94,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Container shipping has become an emission-intensive industry; existing regulations, however, continue to display limitations. Technical emissions reduction measures require large, long-term investments, while operational measures may negatively impact transportation costs and supply-chain practices.

This study discusses such a technological game-changer which utilizes a lighter container type that, contrary to conventional ones, does not require wood in its floor. In this regard, emissions reductions are achieved both due to lower fuel consumption and tree savings. We estimate the global impact of this technology until 2050 using an integrated assessment model and considering different projections about future characteristics of the container fleet. Our results indicate that the adoption of the examined technology can reduce CO 2 emissions by 4.7–18.8% depending on the main fuel used in container shipping lines, saving also a total of about 44 million trees.",1361-9209,Not found

In addition, we have introduced a comprehensive model of the auxiliary systems, which contributes significantly to the total energy consumption ofa bus. The model for auxiliary systems includes heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and other electrical components.

It is necessary for the government to inspire the local transportation system to reduce its pollution emissions. Therefore, this article uses the environmental protection subsidy (EPS) to attract passengers to choose green travel. In order to obtain the optimal solution for green transportation, we propose a bi-level multi-objective optimization model based on the collaborative optimization between EPS coefficient and high-speed rail (HSR) operation planning. There are three main game players, namely the government, HSR enterprise, and passengers. We develop a hybrid optimization algorithm to solve the model and verify this proposed methodology by using the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei intercity transportation network.

This study proposed a stochastic simulation framework to compare how different system types may impact user experience and system operations. The framework estimates actual origins-destinations of travel demands and integrates the user behavior model and rebalance optimization model. Applying the framework to three cities’ BSSs, our simulation results found that, although station capacities restrict bike allocations, the forced rerouting trips (returning bikes to neighboring stations when target stations are full) indirectly rebalance station-based systems. This benefit is lost in dockless systems, partially canceling the benefit of bike allocation flexibility. However, dockless users can save trip time by 10%–15% with bike access/return.

AUM endogenously represents multi-year foresight for the automaker, including decisions about: (i) increasing ZEV model variety, (ii) intra-firm cross-price subsidies, and (iii) investing in R&D to reduce future ZEV costs. Under both optimistic and pessimistic conditions, automakers are simulated to fully or mostly comply with a 2030 requirement of 30% ZEV sales (rather than pay a penalty). Of the three compliance mechanisms, intra-firm cross-price subsidization dominates. The policy could reduce automaker profit by 7% to 44% in 2030 (relative to the baseline in the same year), mostly due to reduced vehicle sales in total, though overall profits still grow year-on-year from 2020.

Results indicate that two distinct substitution patterns moderated by vehicle attributes effectuate diversified outcomes on UF and GHG. Energy efficiency losses due to technology and user preferences counteracts range enabled UF gains offsetting BEV’s GHG benefits. Fuel inefficient ICEs could aggravate emissions of longer-range BEV households. Conversely, energy efficiency improvements can augment GHG reduction, but UF decreases. Maximum UF of 75–80% can be achieved by upgrading to a longer-range BEV.

Based on a panel dataset comprising 285 cities over 2010–2018, we find a negative effect of HSR accessibility on haze pollution. An increase of one standard deviation in HSR accessibility reduces PM2.5 concentration by 0.22%. However, the HSR pollution reduction effect varies significantly across cities. It is found that HSR can reduce haze pollution by improving the efficiency of resource allocation as well as promoting industrial structure change and technological innovation. This study proposes a new solution for pollution, i.e., improving urbanization quality through intercity transport efficiency enhancement.",1361-9209,Not found
Assessing the VMT effect of ridesourcing services in the US,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102816,94,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The net effect of ridesourcing (RS) services on vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is ambiguous. With 2017 US National Household Travel Survey data, this study measures and compares the heterogeneous VMT effects of RS across population groups with various levels of household vehicle access and RS usage. A propensity score matching method was implemented to match RS non-users, occasional users, and frequent users based on observable sociodemographic traits. The results suggest that among drivers with household vehicle access, frequent RS users generate the least VMT, but occasional users actually generate more VMT. Those without a driver’s license or a household vehicle generate lower VMT while use more transit, and increasing RS use uniformly increases their overall VMT generation. We estimate that overall, RS generated a net increase of 7.8 million daily VMT in the US, compared with a counterfactual case in which all NHTS 2017 respondents were non-users of RS.",1361-9209,Not found
Spatial heterogeneity in distance decay of using bike sharing: An empirical large-scale analysis in Shanghai,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102814,94,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Distance decay is a vital aspect for modeling spatial interactions of human movements and an indispensable input for land use planning and travel demand prediction models. Although many studies have investigated the usage demand of bike-sharing systems in an area, research investigating the distance decay patterns of using dockless bike-sharing systems (DLBS) from a spatially heterogeneous perspective based on large-scale datasets is lacking. This study firstly utilizes massive transaction record data from DLBS in Shanghai of China and online map navigator Application Programming Interface to empirically estimate the distance decay patterns of using DLBS and reveal the spatial heterogeneity in distance decay of using DLBS across different urban contexts. Afterward, this study examines the mechanism of spatial heterogeneity in distance decay, leveraging multiple data resources including Point of Interest (POI) data, demographic data, and road network data. The associations among the distance decay of using DLBS with built environment factors are investigated by multiple linear regression. Results indicate that factors such as population density, land use entropy, branch road density, and metro station density are significantly related to larger distance decay of using DLBS, while factors such as commercial land use ratio, industrial land use ratio, and motorway density are significantly linked to smaller distance decay in Shanghai. Lastly, we further employ an adaptative geographically weighted regression to investigate the spatial divergences of the influences of built environment factors on distance decay. Results reveal notably distinct and even inverse influences of a built environment factor on the distance decay of using DLBS in different urban contexts. The findings provide insights into the distance decay patterns of using DLBS in different urban contexts and their interactions with the built environment, which can support accurate planning and management of sustainable DLBS as per specific urban characteristics.",1361-9209,Not found
The effect of highway on spatial distribution and daily activity of mammals,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102808,94,2021-05-01,2021,5,"The Russian Far East is a unique location that may be considered a hot spot of biodiversity in Russia.

We set up camera traps in five lines near the road and obtained photos of 1372 passes of various animals. In total, 15 species of wild mammals were captured by camera traps. Animals preferred to stay far away from the road. This highway became a serious barrier separating the local populations of ungulates and carnivores.

A credit charging scheme incorporating carpool and carbon emissions,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102711,94,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Although shared mobility will mitigate congestion and emissions, car trip frequencies and vehicle miles traveled are likely to rise. The tradable credit scheme (TCS) is a key tool for moderating demand and encouraging more social and environmental trips. Hence, this paper proposes a credit charging method for TCS considering carpooling strategy and carbon emissions. We introduce the credit discount coefficient and carbon emission index in determining the credit price, and explore the road network's credit distribution by using the principle of marginal cost. The results of the case study suggest that the developed scheme performs well in terms of traffic conditions, economical efficiency and carbon emissions. Considering carbon emissions and carpooling, the proposed credit charging method can serve as an effective way to alleviate traffic congestion and pollution. Moreover, the formulation of the credit charging method can provide a feasible approach for TCS design.",1361-9209,Not found

This new reality advances a stricter normative in terms of port emissions. This paper introduces a calculation method to estimate a specific environmental charge in ports to incentivize CI use in Short Sea Shipping. The impact of this charge on the economic performance of the vessel’s operators is assessed through Internal Rate of Return of the CI retrofitting investment in vessels. The calculation method assumes a pollutant differentiation system by considering kinds of vessel, technical features, port localization and hinterlands populations. Results show that, only when the generation of on-shore electricity is dominated by sustainable sources, the environmental charge is effective to stimulate the CI retrofitting of vessels in adverse scenarios. Sensitivity analyses determine that low gross tonnages’ vessels with longer berthing times take greater advantage from CI use.",1361-9209,Not found

The first and second approach deliver marginal divergences of the mean, between 1.1 and 2.1% and below 2.7 respectively, preserving the characteristics of the distribution. The third deviated by up to 5%, but lacked the detailed characteristics of the underlying statistical distribution.

However, the target group (closer to the construction site) exhibited a higher level of annoyance. Noise levels generated by the construction work explained a marginal proportion of the variance in annoyance (<1%).

The proposed method consists of two main parts. First, since the traffic speed is one of the factors affecting the traffic noise, a model of the noise level and traffic speed is proposed to update dynamically the noise source intensity of the whole road network with the real-time noise monitoring data. Second, to avoid redundant computations, the acoustic attenuation terms are calculated in advance and combined with the updated noise source intensity to generate new noise maps.

A lack of understanding of user routing preferences makes it difficult for policymakers to adapt existing infrastructures to accommodate these emerging travel demands. This study develops an e-scooter route choice model to reveal riders’ preferences for different types of transportation infrastructures, using revealed preferences data. The data were collected using Global Positioning System units installed on e-scooters operating on Virginia Tech’s campus. We applied the Recursive Logit route choice model to 2000 randomly sampled e-scooter trajectories. The model results suggest e-scooter riders are willing to travel longer distances to ride in bikeways (59% longer), multi-use paths (29%), tertiary roads (15%), and one-way roads (21%). E-scooter users also prefer shorter and simpler routes. Finally, slope is not a determinant for e-scooter route choice, likely because e-scooters are powered by electricity.",1361-9209,Not found
Analysis of attitudes and engagement of shared e-scooter users,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102790,94,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Micromobility and especially e-scooter sharing have recently attracted a lot of attention, due to the rapid spreading of e-scooters in many cities around the world. However, many local authorities have not yet been prepared for efficiently integrating e-scooters in their transport systems and the exact impact of e-scooters is still unclear. It is therefore essential to understand the way e-scooters operate and their users’ profile. To address these questions, a study was designed based on 578 questionnaires (271 by e-scooter users and 307 by non-users) in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. The analysis utilized a classification tree model for identifying the characteristics of people that are attracted by e-scooters (i.e., used them more than once) and a latent variable logit model for understanding the attributes of the regular e-scooter users. The results show that shared e-scooters mostly replaced walking and public transport trips; therefore, the positive impact of e-scooters on the environment is questioned. Also, the results indicate that people traveling with bicycle or motorcycle were not at all attracted by e-scooters. Moreover, females seem to be less keen on using e-scooters compared to males, while people living downtown are more regular users compared with those living in longer distances from the city center. These findings can aid policymakers in shaping the manner with which e-scooters can be incorporated in their cities.",1361-9209,Not found
Reconstructing and analyzing the traffic flow during evacuation in Hurricane Irma (2017),10.1016/j.trd.2021.102788,94,2021-05-01,2021,5,"Hurricane evacuation has long been a difficult problem perplexing local government. Hurricane Irma in 2017 created the most extensive scale of evacuation in Florida’s history, involving about 6.5 million people in a mandatory evacuation order and an estimated 4 million evacuation vehicles. Traffic jams emerged in mid-Florida and rapidly spread to involve the entire state. To understand the hurricane evacuation process, the spatial and temporal evolution of the traffic flow is a critical piece of information, but it is usually not fully observed. Based on game theory, this paper employs the available traffic observation of main highways to reconstruct the traffic flow on all highways in Florida during Irma. The reconstructed traffic conditions compare well with those simulated by dynamic models while the reconstruction model is computationally much cheaper to use. Validation with smartphone data further confirms that the reconstruction model captures the traffic conditions for real evacuation processes. The reconstructed data show that the evacuation rates for 5 representative cities -- Key West, Miami, Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville-- in Florida were about 90.1%, 38.7%, 52.6%, 22.1%, and 7%, respectively. The peak evacuation traffic flows from Tampa and Miami arrived in the Orlando region at almost the same time, triggering the catastrophic congestion through the entire state. Also, the evacuation for Hurricane Irma was greater than that predicted by an evacuation demand model developed based on previous event and survey data. The detailed evacuation traffic flow reanalysis accomplished in this article lays a foundation for studying evacuation demand as well as developing evacuation management policies.",1361-9209,Not found

By employing real traffic volume data corresponding to the Yeouido Island’s transport network in Seoul, Korea, we demonstrate that, relative to the conventional shortest path approach, considering the structural and operational features of transport networks using a link-based betweenness centrality measure has a better evacuation performance during high evacuation demand periods by lowering network clearance time.

"Can transit investments in low-income neighbourhoods increase transit use? Exploring the nexus of income, car-ownership, and transit accessibility in Toronto",10.1016/j.trd.2021.102849,95,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Transportation equity advocates recommend improving public transit in low-income neighbourhoods to alleviate socio-spatial inequalities and increase quality of life. However, transportation planners often overlook transit investments in neighbourhoods with “transit-captive” populations because they are assumed to result in less mode-shifting, congestion relief, and environmental benefits, compared to investments that aim to attract choice riders in wealthier communities. In North American cities, while many low-income households are already transit users, some also own and use private vehicles. It suggests that transit improvements in low-income communities could indeed result in more transit use and less car use. Accordingly, the main objective of this article is to explore the statistical relationship between transit use and transit accessibility as well as how this varies by household income and vehicle ownership in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). Using stratified regression models, we find that low-income households with one or more cars per adult have the most elastic relationship between transit accessibility and transit use; they are more likely to be transit riders if transit improves. However, we confirm that in auto-centric areas with poor transit, the transit use of low-income households drops off sharply as car ownership increases. On the other hand, a sensitivity analysis suggests more opportunities for increasing transit ridership among car-deficit households when transit is improved. These findings indicate that improving transit in low-income inner suburbs, where most low-income car-owning households are living, would align social with environmental planning goals.",1361-9209,Not found

First, this study quantifies the emission factors of both regular ridesourcing and ridesplitting trips to evaluate the emission reductions per ride-km from ridesplitting. The results show that the average emission reduction rates of CO2, CO, NOx, and HC are 28.7%, 32.5%, 27.7%, and 31.2%, respectively. Then, a spatiotemporal analysis of the emission reductions indicates that ridesplitting generally reduces more emissions around the expressways and during peak hours. Finally, a spatial error model is adopted to analyze the effects of travel-related and built environment variables on emission reductions from ridesplitting. The trajectory overlapping rate of shared rides turns out to be the most important determinant for expanding the environmental benefits of ridesplitting.",1361-9209,Not found

Emission values for various pollutants are calculated for each link using the HBEFA database, accounting for vehicle type, road category and traffic conditions. For congestion, average link delays are computed for each hour of the day. We apply this methodology to GPS trips collected during a national mobility pricing study. The methodology is validated against the Swiss national estimates. The range of per-kilometer values for various external costs are compared to the Swiss norm values.

The increase in alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) registration shares due to the LEZ is found to be significant but fosters rather fossil fuel powered AFV and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) than zero emission vehicles. This is reflected in the average CO2 emissions of newly registered vehicles, which do not decrease significantly. In consequence, while the LEZ is a suitable measure for stimulating the shift towards low emission vehicles, a true zero emission zone would be required for effectively fostering also the decarbonization of the vehicle fleet.",1361-9209,Not found

Aircraft-related costs are driven by a huge increase in aircraft swaps and cancellations; and passenger-related costs are driven by increases in disrupted (misconnected) passengers who need to be rebooked on the same or a different airline.

Moreover, name-centered gender prediction analysis is employed to identify rider gender and then discover differences in review content and factors of satisfaction across gender. Results suggest rider satisfaction levels tend to vary across topics and gender. Women were more satisfied with the services and exhibited more positive sentiment than men.

The development of a method to assess factors contributing to rider satisfaction offers the ability to evaluate e-scooter rider needs and barriers. An apparent policy opportunity to increase scooter ridership includes an emphasis on contributing factors such as ease of use, safety (speed and riding lane), as well as app issues that showed significant influence on user satisfaction.

Results from this study show the disparate nature of roadway utilization during mass evacuations – while most interstates remained congested during the major evacuation period, several other highways remained underutilized, potentially due to the lack of information on roadway conditions during evacuation. On the other hand, certain roadways that were typically underutilized suffered from severe congestion and bottlenecking during the evacuation.

Increasing the pace of electrification is beneficial for the carbon footprint regardless of global manufacturing decarbonization pathways.

"An eco-score system incorporating driving behavior, vehicle characteristics, and traffic conditions",10.1016/j.trd.2021.102866,95,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This study employs two eco-scoring methods to evaluate driving behavior based on real-world GPS data collected from drivers using an insurance mobile application in two provinces of Canada, Ontario and Quebec. Method 1 provides an eco-score based on greenhouse gas emissions (CO2eq) and energy consumption considering vehicle characteristics. For electric and hybrid vehicles, an equivalent fuel efficiency, which is defined as the amount of energy consumed by alternative fuel vehicles to that of traditional gas-powered cars, is calculated for each trip record and each alternative vehicle model. Method 2 improves the algorithm by considering on-road traffic conditions and scoring trips relative to other trips experiencing similar traffic conditions. Our results demonstrate that representativeness of the eco-score system is improved after incorporating traffic conditions as trips will less likely be penalized for stop-and-go driving in congested conditions or receive high eco-scores although they have relatively low average speed on uncongested highways.",1361-9209,Not found
Could fast battery charging effectively mitigate range anxiety in electric vehicle usage?Evidence from large-scale data on travel and charging in Beijing,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102840,95,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Range anxiety is a psychological condition in which people worry that the limited battery capacity of electric vehicles (EV) will result in running out of power before reaching their destination. In this paper, with the application of quantile regression, 1.7 million charging and driving records for EVs in Beijing are used to explore how fast charging impacts on range anxiety. As state of charge (SOC) is highly related to range anxiety, this paper mainly focuses on the relationship between the charging rate and the SOC, which can be further extended to range anxiety. The results show that the charging rate is negatively related to the SOC, which indicates that fast charging could improve the charging rate and then reduce both the SOC and range anxiety. Temperature positively moderates the effects of the charging rate on range anxiety, which indicates that fast charging would be more effective in reducing range anxiety when it is a cold weather. Additionally, the quantity of charging piles negatively moderates the relationship between the charging rate and range anxiety. However, range anxiety may also influence the choice of charging rate, which might bring a reverse causality problem between the charging rate and the SOC, and result in an exaggerated significance of our analysis. After discussing the endogeneity of our regression results, we believe the possible bias is still totally acceptable.",1361-9209,Not found
The sharing economy and consumer preferences for environmentally sustainable last mile deliveries,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102863,95,2021-06-01,2021,6,"This paper addresses whether consumers’ environmental attitudes and behavior are reflected in their stated preferences for last mile delivery options for clothing rentals, and whether preferences are heterogenous across groups of respondents in terms of socioeconomic characteristics, income, and environmental attitudes. The analysis relies on data collected through a discrete choice experiment among Norwegian females between 18 and 70 years of age. The key results are: i) females have a negative utility from delivery time, delays, local air pollutants (PM) and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2) from last mile deliveries, and a positive utility from information services and ii) females consumers are likely to accept increased delivery time if it implies reduced emissions. The findings are relevant for both urban planners, online retailers, and transport operators as they show that consumers prefer environmentally sustainable last mile delivery options and that other measures than price can incentivize consumers to choose sustainable deliveries.",1361-9209,Not found

We find that, first, the emissions per capita are significantly higher in developed countries than in developing countries. Second, the distribution of emissions in developed countries is disperse, while the emissions in developing countries are concentrated within a limited number of large cities. Third, the proportion of emissions from short-haul flights in China is much smaller than that in other countries. The development of high-speed rail in China may be one of main reasons for such a pattern. Finally, several policy implications are discussed.",1361-9209,Not found
Development of heavy-duty vehicle representative driving cycles via decision tree regression,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102843,95,2021-06-01,2021,6,"Previously, researchers who developed representative driving cycles mainly focused on light-duty vehicles and only considered vehicle speed and related derivations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to develop representative cycles for heavy-duty vehicles. By implementing decision tree regression (DTR) to the Fleet DNA on-road vehicle data, a broader set of metrics, such as engine power and fuel consumption, can be used for more robust cycle development. Additionally, the influence of each metric on the regression target is also accounted for by a weighted number derived through the DTR to enhance the representativenss of the developed cycle. As case studies, we applied the proposed method to five heavy-duty vocations (drayage, long haul, regional haul, local delivery, and transit bus) and derived the most representative cycle, as well as four extreme cycles (maximal energy consumption, maximal power-weighted work, maximal fraction of high speed, and minimal fuel economy) to advance the related alternative powertrain design.",1361-9209,Not found

An integrated decision-making framework for dispatching and charging has been proposed using system optimization approaches. An agent-based platform has been developed for simulating and testing the proposed methods. A case study using New York City taxi data has been performed with different fleet sizes, dispatching strategies, and charging networks. Advantages of optimization-based approaches for AEV fleet management have been studied and demonstrated, for example, for a fleet of 1,750 AEVs to meet 100,000 daily requests, optimization-based centralized fleet management would result in 14% more ride requests satisfied and 43% fewer zero-occupancy miles traveled than if AEVs make independent decisions based on heuristic strategy.

Road sections are removed according to different elimination types: random order, deterministic order of criticality, and deterministic order in areas at high risk of flooding. The results show that the Sardinian network is more resilient than the Valencian network, despite its poorer quality.

In this paper, the shift from carsharing to scooter–sharing is of particular interest. A stated preference survey targeting young individuals (18–34 years old) conducted in Munich was used to estimate a choice model between carsharing and scooter–sharing.

Who saves money buying electric vehicles?

Total Cost of Ownership studies have shown that for the average US consumer, EVs cost more than gasoline-fueled vehicles. We contribute to this literature with a focus on heterogeneity across space and driving habits. Specifically, we estimate 5-year ownership costs for four EVs and four gasoline-fueled vehicles by neighborhood across Los Angeles County. Due to variation in electricity rates, insurance rates, and vehicle miles traveled, the median cost varies across neighborhoods by a factor of between 1.2 and 1.35, depending on the vehicle. Median costs of ownership are usually higher for EVs than for comparable gasoline-fueled cars, but considering the full distribution of vehicle miles traveled suggests that buying an EV saves money for over 17% of households.",1361-9209,Not found

As industrial activities are the highest source of pollution, HSRs can affect local PM2.5 concentrations by changing firm and/or industrial agglomeration patterns. We further explored this channel by using HSR connectivity as an instrumental variable, and found that PM2.5 concentrations will decline by 2.74% on average due to the migration of polluting firms induced by HSR connections.

Results suggest that - for people living in the countryside - carsharing users have a 3 times higher likelihood of choosing a micro to mid-sized battery electric vehicle compared to participants without carsharing experience. We find a similar trend for people living in the agglomerations. We therefore recommend policy makers and mobility planners to take these benefits into account when planning carsharing services and its role in mobility systems.",1361-9209,Not found
"Urban main road capacity reduction: Adaptations, effects and consequences",10.1016/j.trd.2021.102848,96,2021-07-01,2021,7,"To support sustainable urban mobility strategies, reallocating road space from private vehicles to other uses may be a relevant intervention. Novel empirical knowledge could reduce barriers for implementing such interventions. A planned, 14-month capacity reduction of a main road tunnel in Oslo, Norway, carrying 70,000 vehicles a day, offered an excellent opportunity to document how commuters adapted, and what effects and consequences they experienced. Analyses of traffic data were combined with surveys and interviews with commuters. Congestion increased in the tunnel and on adjacent road-links, although road users adapted in ways resulting in significant traffic reduction through the tunnel. Some employees in an area near the tunnel experienced increased time-usage on their commute, and some adapted by changing transport mode, route, or trip-timing. However, results showed that they did not experience major negative consequences. Few commuters reported a need to shift routines in the household, and commuter satisfaction remained high.",1361-9209,Not found
Greenhouse gas impact of digitalizing shipping documents: Blockchain vs. centralized systems,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102942,97,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Digitalizing documents is evaluated as a key value-added factor in greening maritime transportation. Covid-19 accelerates the need for digitalizing shipping documents. However, very few studies analyze digitalization in maritime transportation from the environmental aspect, which is an important topic considering the global emphasis on decarbonization. The methods to measure document-related emissions are mainly conceptual guidelines. Therefore, this research aims to develop an estimation framework with concrete methods to quantify the greenhouse gas reductions from digitalizing shipping documents. Taking Singapore and China as examples, this study compares blockchain with centralized systems and an integrated platform with separate platforms. The major results are 1) digitalization can reduce over 99% of document-related emissions; 2) passenger road transport to transfer documents is the largest emission source in paper systems constituting over 90% of emissions per shipping event; 3) blockchain and centralized systems have similar effects on emission reductions; so do integrated and separated platforms.",1361-9209,Not found

Through collecting 1,345 passenger satisfaction questionnaires about ARIS, surveyed in Shijiazhuang, China, we first apply latent class clustering to classify passengers into three groups. Then, the key factors affecting passenger satisfaction and its subsequent effect on loyalty and complaints are identified using a partial least squares structural equation model. Finally, path heterogeneities in different passenger groups are explored using a multi-group analysis. The results show that the three passenger groups attach similar importance to ticket services, reliability, accessibility and comfort, while some noticeable differences in perception are identified in personalized services, information services, and connectivity.",1361-9209,Not found
Smarter charging: Power allocation accounting for travel time of electric vehicle drivers,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102916,97,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Growing electric vehicle (EV) dissemination will increase charging infrastructure installation at home. Similar daily routines are associated with high peak loads due to simultaneous EV charging. However, predominantly residential power transmission is not designed for such high loads, yielding charging bottlenecks and restricting future charging at home. Addressing such bottleneck situations and including the EV driver perspective, we introduce a power allocation mechanism that considers the total travel time of the upcoming trip, consisting of actual driving time and time required for charging externally (including the detour to public charging facilities). Assuming that travel time generally negatively correlates with EV driver utility, our optimization model maximizes the resulting utility of EV drivers. Avoiding unnecessary external charging stops due to an insufficient state of charge at the time of departure, our approach generates travel time savings that increase overall EV driver utility. We illustrate our approach using exemplary cases.",1361-9209,Not found

Current measurement techniques cannot produce precise CO2 emission data, and this uncertainty makes previous approaches problematic for analyzing energy and environmental efficiency. This study combines stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA-2) with data envelopment analysis (DEA) to evaluate the energy and environmental efficiency of Chinese transportation sectors in the presence of uncertain CO2 emission data. The improved SMAA-DEA approach effectively handles CO2 data uncertainty and also considers all possible input and output weights, thus providing meaningful information (such as maximum efficiency, average efficiency, and rank acceptability index) to guide the development of effective policies to improve efficiency. This study’s empirical findings show that the energy and environmental efficiency of transportation sectors in 30 provincial regions is poor, great efficiency disparities exist between regions, and uneven development has occurred in China.",1361-9209,Not found
Effects analysis of light-duty diesel truck hybrid conversion depending on driving style,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102958,97,2021-08-01,2021,8,"This study performs an effects analysis of the hybrid conversion of a light-duty diesel truck depending on driving style. The experimental route is extracted from real delivery routes, and multiple drivers drive the route several times before and after the conversion. The results confirm that the fuel economy is improved by 24.3% on average after the conversion, and the fuel economy before and after the conversion is most strongly dependent on average engine speed and regenerative braking ratio, respectively. This different dependence on the driving style parameters is analyzed in relation to the control strategy and powertrain of the converted truck. An additional experiment reveals that the fuel economy of the converted truck can be further improved by 13.3% when visual feedback is provided to the unaware driver for correcting driving styles.

In regard to the weather parameters, dynamic models for air temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction are included. The traffic models is instead based on a macroscopic approach which describes the density dynamically by means of a simple autoregressive process. The enhanced format is structured in a hierarchical fashion, allowing for ease of implementation and modularity. The novel models are parametrised starting from data available from external databases. The possibility of generating synthetic data using the statistical descriptors introduced in the paper is also discussed. To investigate the impact of the novel parameters over energy efficiency, a sensitivity analysis is conducted with a combinatorial test design.

We propose a general framework of engineering resilience for infrastructure systems in the context of climate change and illustrate its application for the assessment of SLR impacts on the rail rapid transit network in Boston. Within this framework, projected coastal flood events are treated as exogenous exposure events, which interact with both physical and topological endogenous network characteristics. We consider contextual aspects of resilience by assigning relative importance to links based on passenger flows. Resilience is computed assuming a linear recovery model, neglecting recovery strategies. Using a reference 1–100 year coastal flood event we show decreasing resilience of the rail transit network as projected SLR increases. The proposed framework can be readily extended to consider more sophisticated performance models, recovery strategies, other perturbation events, and additional contextual factors, such as equity considerations.",1361-9209,Not found

Using survey data from 565 commuters in Portland, Oregon, we compared satisfaction with the most recent commute trip (using the chosen mode) and hypothetical commute satisfaction if using an alternative mode. The difference in travel satisfaction between the chosen and alternative mode – referred to as the travel satisfaction gap – was used as a fine-grained proxy measure of travel captivity. Results indicate that active mode (walk/bicycle) users would be less satisfied when the alternative modes were auto or transit, while auto and transit commuters would be slightly more satisfied if they commuted by walking or bicycling. These outcomes suggest that auto users are most captive, while active travelers are mostly choice users. Results also show that respondents would be more satisfied with an alternative mode if it would enable more talking to other passengers.",1361-9209,Not found

This paper shines a light on the traffic noise level in the Arabian Gulf region. More specifically, it predicts the traffic noise level on a ring road in Kuwait by using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Field measurements data were collected from 20 different measurement points twice a day. It resulted in 480 measurements of ten variables: traffic noise level, light and heavy vehicle count, average speed of both, road width, building height, pavement condition, and air and roadway temperature. To assist in collecting the data, a vision-based vehicle detection system was developed using machine learning. The system successfully managed to reach an accuracy of 90%, whereas the ANFIS traffic noise prediction model achieved a RMSE of 0.0022. The model was then tested on a different road as a validation step, where it gave a RMSE of 0.06. Afterward, two sensitivity analysis techniques were utilized to rank the nine input variables from the highest relative importance to the lowest: the R 2 -based metric and single-input single-output. Based on the results, the most important variable was light vehicle count, and the least effective variable was heavy vehicle count. The air and road temperatures were ranked the fourth and the seventh respectively. Subsequently, four different scenarios were designed to predict the traffic noise level in 2025. The first three scenarios were based on the sensitivity analysis results. Scenario I assumes a reduction in the speed limits on the ring road from 120 km/h to 100 km/h. Scenario II assumes the building height would be high, which will give the same effect as adding a noise barrier. Scenario III assumes there would be a truck curfew in the evening. Finally, Scenario IV assumes there would be no noise control system at all. The results were equal to 76.01, 80.66, 83.36, and 84.56 dBA respectively.

The DARE method was applied first to the BSS service area in Munich, Germany, and then, to the area surrounding Munich, demonstrating the method’s transferability. Incorporating equity resulted in disadvantaged areas being better served by bike-sharing stations while favoring ridership (demand) tended to cluster stations in the wealthier city center.

Based on the significant determinants and major technological innovation-based factors, we further design a simulation model to gauge the impact of each attribute on total carbon emissions of the airlines when the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme in International Aviation (CORSIA) is implemented. The findings suggest that the adoption of alternative biofuels and CORSIA implementation are necessary steps towards a carbon neutral future. Useful insights on route configuration and adoption of fuel-efficient aircraft fleet are also discussed.",1361-9209,Not found
Impact of data processing on deriving micro-mobility patterns from vehicle availability data,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102913,97,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Vehicle availability data is emerging as a potential data source for micro-mobility research and applications. However, there is not yet research that systematically evaluates or validates the processing of this emerging mobility data. To fill this gap, we propose a generally applicable data processing framework and validate its related algorithms. The framework exploits micro-mobility vehicle availability data to identify individual trips and derive aggregate patterns by evaluating a range of temporal, spatial, and statistical mobility descriptors. The impact of data processing is systematically and rigorously investigated by applying the proposed framework with a case study dataset from Zurich, Switzerland. Our results demonstrate that the sampling rate used when collecting vehicle availability data has a significant and intricate impact on the derived micro-mobility patterns. This research calls for more attention to investigate various issues with emerging mobility data processing to ensure its validity for transportation research and practices.",1361-9209,Not found
Interactions between Arctic passenger ship activities and emissions,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102925,97,2021-08-01,2021,8,"The ice melt in the Arctic region has generated a great opportunity for passenger ships to sail in the Arctic. As such, a significant growth of passenger ship activities in this region has created an ever-increasing air pollution, which has had an adverse effect on the maritime Arctic ecosystem. Due to the fragility of the Arctic marine environment, it is critical to conduct a thorough analysis of the passenger ship activities in the Arctic and assess their environmental effects on the Arctic. This paper uses the Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) data to analyze passenger ship trajectories and sailing speed in the Arctic from 2012 to 2017. Based on the passenger ship characteristics data combined with the bottom-up pollution emission models, we quantify passenger ship pollutants in the Arctic. Furthermore, we evaluate the CO2 equivalent emissions for the four shipping fuel options of interest. New findings include: (1) Passenger ships have discharged an average of 39.17 tons of black carbon (BC) and 3824.01 tons of SOx in the Arctic each year (i.e., from 2012 to 2017); (2) Among the four operating modes, cruising exhibited the largest amount of BC and SOx emissions, followed by berthing, anchoring, and maneuvering; (3) The amounts of BC and SOx emitted from auxiliary engines (AEs) were the highest, followed by main engines (MEs) and boilers (BOs); and (4) Arctic passenger ship emissions have shown significant monthly, daily and hourly variations. Besides, the results show that in the short term, passenger ships using very low Sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) in the Arctic are the most viable and environmental-friendly, whereas in the long term, passenger ships using liquefied natural gas (LNG) would be even better. This investigation provides a valuable set of insights for passenger ship operators, policymakers, and scientists to design and implement future passenger ship activities in the Arctic. As expected, a control of pollution emissions can be improved, and necessary actions should be taken in the future.",1361-9209,Not found
Investigating the economic impact of noise barriers on single-family housing markets,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102945,97,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Noise has important consequences on health, and these impacts are internalized into real estate prices. From a landscape and public policy perspective, the construction of noise barriers appears to be an effective solution to reduce the impact of negative externalities. However, barriers also create local negative externalities for owners, such as a reduction in sunshine hours and visual encumbrance. The aim of the paper is to investigate the local net effect of noise barriers for the Greater Montreal area using single-family house transactions between 2000 and 2017. The analysis is based on a matching methodological framework with a difference-in-difference approach applied on various noise levels along highway segments. The estimated net impact appears to be place-dependent, with a price premium being assigned to houses located closer to the core of the metropolitan area. This conclusion points towards considering those specificities when authorities aim at implementing such an infrastructure.",1361-9209,Not found
Optimal regulatory policies for charging of electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102922,97,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Electric vehicles (EVs) and their associated charging stations are characterized by indirect network effects. In this paper we propose a theoretical model covering both the entry of charging stations and the sales of EVs. The model is used to study policies for developing an adequate charging network for existing and future EVowners. First, we find that governments should subsidize both the variable charging costs at each station and the costs of market entry for charging stations. The charging subsidy should ensure marginal cost pricing on charging, while the entry costs subsidy internalizes the indirect network externality. Second, we also find that the ongoing transition to one charging standard in Europe will unambiguously mean higher market shares for EVs and higher welfare for EV owners.",1361-9209,Not found

Modeling analysis using original vehicle population projections and real-world NOx emission factors, are used to estimate emissions over the 2020 to 2040 timeframe. Analysis shows that emissions are significantly impacted by the rate of deployment of cleaner technology options. GHG results show that very aggressive deployment of low carbon technologies is necessary to achieve 2040 emission targets. The results show accelerating the fleet turnover to be a more important NOx control strategy than dividing the vehicle replacement between NZEVs and ZEVs. The analysis suggests that Heavy-Heavy-Duty (HHD) NZEVs should be encouraged in the near to mid-term, and even long-term, if operated on renewable natural gas.",1361-9209,Not found
Bicycling facility inequalities and the causality dilemma with socioeconomic/sociodemographic change,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102920,97,2021-08-01,2021,8,"How well has the recent expansion of bicycling networks advanced transportation justice through appropriate distribution across the socioeconomic/demographic (SED) spectrum? Furthermore, does the installation of bicycling facilities lead to SED changes in a neighborhood or vice versa? We longitudinally assess 11,010 miles of bicycling facilities over ten years (2010–2019) in 11,293 block groups across 29 U.S. cities by facility type. Findings suggest inequalities in bicycling facility installation with People of Color (POC) experiencing the lowest rates of overall facility installation. However, bike lane installation was concentrated in lower-income areas (both POC and White). The causality relationships between bicycling facilities and SED changes were weak and largely non-significant. Income increases were followed by bicycling facility installations more so than increases in White populations were followed by bicycling facility installations. SED changes were more correlated with later bicycling facility installation than the inverse, suggesting that bicycling facilities were not linked to displacement.",1361-9209,Not found
Equitable resource allocation for municipal safety: A data envelopment analysis,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102926,97,2021-08-01,2021,8,"To improve local roadway safety, the diverse nature of municipalities must be considered given their differing needs associated with their unique population characteristics and physical environments. Yet, these differences are not accounted for in the current funding frameworks that support local highway departments. This paper explores the factors that impede the ability of municipalities to efficiently and equitably distribute highway funding to improve local road safety. Data envelopment analysis is conducted by fusing municipal highway staff data, municipal highway expenditure data, crash data, geographic data, and demographic data. Among other findings, this study concludes that non-white and rural regions require more financial support to equitably improve safety. Further, data envelopment analysis is demonstrated to be a beneficial method to consider equity disparities at a local level. The results suggest where local highway resources should be invested to efficiently and equitably improve local roadway safety.",1361-9209,Not found

Nevertheless, electric vehicle adoption is progressing slowly. Vehicle fleets are a promising starting point for increased market penetration. With this study, we address the issue of fleet electrification by analyzing a data set of 81 empirical mobility patterns of commercial fleets. We conduct a simulation to design a decision support system for fleet managers evaluating which fleets have a good potential for electrification and how fleets can improve the number of successful electric trips by adapting their charging strategy. We consider both heuristics and optimized scheduling. Our results show that a large share of fleets can score a close to optimal charging schedule using a simple charging heuristic. For all other fleets, we provide a decision mechanism to assess the potential of smart charging mechanisms.",1361-9209,Not found

However, conventional measurements of accessibility cannot capture individual experiences and perceptions of accessibility. Moreover, since many daily necessities and services can only be acquired online during the pandemic, the ease of using smartphone-based services play an essential role in people’s everyday lives. Therefore, this paper investigates the relationship between the ease of using smartphone-based services, perceived accessibility, and perceived transport equity during the pandemic. Based on 186 family interviews, a panel survey with 569 respondents was conducted monthly from February to October 2020 in Kunming, China, and a three-wave cross-lagged panel model was developed to understand the causal relationship between the three constructs. The results indicate that the ease of using smartphone-based services dominantly influence transport equity in the early phase of the pandemic, but its effect faded after the lifting of travel restrictions. Perceived accessibility to services appears a sound indicator for transport equity in the new normal, but perceived accessibility and transport equity are not strongly associated when staying at home is perceived as desirable. Moreover, we found that contemporary practices of smartphone-based new mobility services only favour those who already have convenient access to services and have further excluded and marginalised disadvantaged populations, which urgently require policy interventions.",1361-9209,Not found

This research surveys Chinese university students to understand the factors associated with their willingness to participate in and pay for voluntary carbon offsets and compulsory taxes for domestic and international travel. Our survey subjects represent the future frequent flyers and a generation likely to be impacted the most by global warming. We find that their willingness to pay (WTP) for carbon emissions reduction is positively related to income, levels of environmental concern and trust in the carbon offsetting/reduction projects. Females tend to have a higher WTP than males. The intention to contribute during the Covid-19 pandemic was lower. The mean WTP for the voluntary offsetting regime for domestic travel is approximately 36.33yuan, whereas the mean WTP for domestic travel under the compulsory regime is about 28.65yuan. For international travel, these two figures are 45.37yuan and 71.70yuan, respectively.",1361-9209,Not found

To address this lacuna, we use clustering techniques involving time-series (shape) based distances on the raw data directly to obtain representative sets of real world drive cycles. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using experimental data from a fleet of eight motorcycles run across five locations in India. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance based clustering gives optimal results. We give theoretical and experimental justification for our constructions.

Comparing emissions of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and metals from marine fuels and scrubbers,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102912,97,2021-08-01,2021,8,"In January 2020, new global regulations were implemented to limit the maximum sulphur content in marine fuels. As an alternative to switch to compliant fuels, the regulations allow for installations of exhaust gas cleaning systems, e.g. scrubbers, that enables a continued use of less expensive heavy fuel oils (HFOs). Characterization of scrubber discharge water shows that the acidified water also becomes enriched with contaminants, and large quantities of metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are thus being discharged directly to the marine environment. When emissions of contaminants to the atmosphere and the marine environment are evaluated simultaneously, the results show that HFO, with scrubbers installed, generates higher emission factors of both metals and PAHs compared to MGO. This highlights the importance of including both the marine and the atmospheric perspective when comparing environmental loads and impact of contaminants from shipping.",1361-9209,Not found

A case study is then adopted to demonstrate the usefulness of this framework. Out of eight network-level pavement maintenance budget scenarios, the 85M plan (representing an annual maintenance budget of AUD$85M) is selected as the optimal solution in an initial experiment in which equal weights are allocated to the four attributes. In an additional experiment with 1000 sets of randomly assigned weights, the 85M plan was also selected as the optimal option for 596 trials.

The study findings reveal that males consider passenger ease, whereas females consider service availability as most influential factors in explaining overall SQ. Females are less concerned about passenger ease and seamless connectivity, as compared to males. Further, gender-based importance-performance analysis has highlighted that Delhi Metro must consider ‘safety and security’ as most crucial factor to improve its services.

Life cycle assessment of mid-range passenger cars powered by liquid and gaseous biofuels: Comparison with greenhouse gas emissions of electric vehicles and forecast to 2030,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102897,97,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Electrification of the transport sector is a relevant measure to decarbonize, but the massive electrification approach can be questioned since another interesting low-carbon solutions are available. Current and future forecast comparative analysis of the greenhouse gas emissions of mid-range passenger cars, obtained using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, are presented. Two important factors are addressed by assessing the use of biofuels suitable for internal combustion engines (including bio natural gas vehicles) and forecasting the LCA results in 2030 with updated vehicle weight, battery technology, and CO2 electricity content. The synthesis shows that conventional engines powered with biofuels complement electrified powertrains. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles seem to be the ideal solution owing to the limited size of their batteries. The current trend of expanding the battery size to improve the range of electric vehicles is detrimental to greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts. Biofuels can provide significant GHG emission benefits in a short time as vehicle powertrains can already accommodate up to 85% ethanol or 100% biodiesel without engine changes.",1361-9209,Not found

This paper analyzes the well-to-wheel climate performance of gas and electric vehicles in Europe, taking into account the share of biomethane in vehicle gas as well as the production systems for biomethane and electricity in different countries. The results show that both gas and electric vehicles can significantly reduce the climate change impact of transports compared to diesel. In an average European electricity system, electricity has around 30% lower climate impact than diesel for a heavy truck, and 65–70% lower for a passenger car or city bus. Average European vehicle gas reduces the climate impact by up to 28% compared to diesel, or 11% compared to fossil natural gas, and in some countries vehicle gas has lower climate impact than electricity. This demonstrates the importance of not limiting analysis and policy to tailpipe emissions.",1361-9209,Not found
Estimating wildlife strike costs at US airports: A machine learning approach,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102907,97,2021-08-01,2021,8,"Current lower bound estimates of the economic burden of wildlife strikes make use of mean cost assignment to impute missing values in the National Wildlife Strike Database (NWSD).

We estimate that wildlife strikes costed the US civil aviation industry a minimum average of $54.3 million in total losses annually over the 1990–2018 period. If one assumes that wildlife strikes were underreported by as much as a factor of 3 over the same period, our estimates still fall below previous lower bound estimates.",1361-9209,Not found
Exploring the future energy-mobility nexus: The transportation energy &amp; mobility pathway options (TEMPO) model,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102967,98,2021-09-01,2021,9,"This paper documents the approaches and methods used in the Transportation Energy & Mobility Pathway Options™ (TEMPO) model to evaluate passenger and freight demand for transportation and mobility services, project vehicle ownership and technology adoption decisions, and determine transport mode choices to derive scenarios of future energy use and emissions. TEMPO is an all-inclusive transportation demand model that covers the entire United States, with an implicit spatial resolution and an hourly temporal resolution that allows for generating time-resolved energy use profiles to assess multisectoral integration aspects. Key features of the TEMPO model include the ability to perform endogenous out-of-sample forecasting to extrapolate recent emerging trends and analyze impacts of disruptive technological breakthroughs and behavioral changes. TEMPO employs an innovative representation of passenger mobility demand stemming from household-level decisions that determine vehicle adoption, ownership, and use based on sociodemographics (e.g., income, household composition), technology attributes (e.g., travel cost, time), geography (e.g., urban, suburban, rural) and population-specific multiday mobility and travel requirements. This representation enables a more forward-looking perspective on the use of new mobility options and the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, as well as a more accurate representation of their energy usage profiles than previous modeling approaches. A comparison with the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook showcases the ability of TEMPO to accurately replicate widely accepted projections by representing the key elements of the entire transportation sector at the appropriate level of resolution. TEMPO is intended to generate future scenarios of technology adoption, energy use, and emissions in the transportation sector to compare alternatives, inform decision makers, and assess integration with energy infrastructure and supply systems at an appropriate spatiotemporal resolution.",1361-9209,Not found

The railway transport process efficiency is decomposed into assets and service efficiency. The additive decomposition network Data Envelopment Analysis (NDEA) approach is customised to account for intermediate and undesirable outputs. Results suggest that Estonia, Germany and Poland are overall environmentally efficient and that except for Finland, asset efficient countries are also service efficient; the inverse does not hold.

Here, we evaluate the energy consumption and duration of trips before and after driving style changes. These modifications are made using emissions-friendly driving style heuristics that are easily implementable by drivers and do not require real-time feedback or on-board diagnostics. We use a data-driven approach to apply these heuristics to a representative baseline of U.S. drive cycles. The simulated driving-style improvements provide an average fuel savings per trip of 6%, alongside a 1.5% increase in trip duration. Decelerating early and reducing highway speeds can each contribute substantially to fuel savings. Accelerating more gradually contributes less. The percentage fuel savings are relatively consistent across locations and vehicle classes. These findings can inform several decision-makers, including drivers aiming to reduce fuel consumption, car manufacturers or software developers designing driving style feedback, and policy makers examining emissions savings opportunities.",1361-9209,Not found

Currently obtaining accurate information about the personal exposure of a commuter is challenging as existing solutions either have a coarse monitoring resolution that omits subtle variations in pollutant concentrations or are laborious and costly to use. We contribute by systematically analysing the feasibility of using wearable low-cost pollution sensors for capturing the total exposure of commuters. Through extensive experiments carried out in the Helsinki metropolitan region, we demonstrate that low-cost sensors can capture the overall exposure with sufficient accuracy, while at the same time providing insights into variations within transport modalities. We also demonstrate that wearable sensors can capture subtle variations caused by differing routes, passenger density, location within a carriage, and other factors. For example, we demonstrate that location within the vehicle carriage can result in up to 25 % increase in daily pollution exposure – a significant difference that existing solutions are unable to capture. Finally, we highlight the practical benefits of low-cost sensors as a pollution monitoring solution by introducing applications that are enabled by low-cost wearable sensors.",1361-9209,Not found
"Ride to the hills, ride to your school: Physical effort and mode choice",10.1016/j.trd.2021.102983,98,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Altering the network of public facilities like schools is likely to affect travel choices, in particular route and mode choice. Traveling to school is not only a major contributor to public transport demand in peak periods, but is in many instances also the trip purpose where young people are engaged in bicycling. However, in contrast to public transport, an active travel mode like bicycling needs (substantial) own physical activity as input into the ‘production’ of a trip. The objective of this paper is to improve our understanding of the substitution between bicycling and public transport in school travel focusing on an underrated determinant in the literature – the personal effort (e.g. energy input in terms of kcal) of students when traveling by bike (or walk). It is shown that a local government aiming at maximizing social welfare when making decisions on the density of public school facilities would be well advised to take this cross effect into account. We use a large unique data set of travel-to-school mode choice in the city of Dresden (Germany). We estimate a series of multivariate extreme value models and derive the elasticity of bike usage and the cross-elasticity of public transport demand with respect to the physical effort. The results reveal that effort elasticity of bike usage is significantly negative, whereas the effort cross-elasticity of public transport demand is significantly positive. In both cases, the responses are highest for school travel distances between 1 and 3 km, but relatively inelastic, meaning that a widespread adoption of pedelecs (or even e-bikes) in school travel could have only limited impacts on peak-period public transport demand.",1361-9209,Not found

In the previous studies on OWC, location-based units such as a single station, station cluster, and land parcel were generally used as the basic analysis units for demand; however, these studies failed to consider the association among the operating areas. This led to results that were pertinent to a specific OWC system and cross-section of the development process. The objective of this study is to explore the significant factors related to flow-based demand (i.e., four-weekly bookings from the origin spatial unit to the destination spatial unit (OD bookings)). Four groups of explanatory variables are adopted: carsharing spatial unit attributes, built environment, transportation facilities, and OD trip attributes (such as public transportation and car travel distance between the OD). A combination model integrating machine learning and a generalized linear model is also developed to address the zero-inflation issue of the data. Moreover, an approach of Shapley additive explanations is implemented to determine the considerable effects of the factors. The results show that (1) the OD trip attributes play an important role in estimating the carsharing OD demand; (2) taxi and carsharing demands exhibit a non-significant partial overlap, and carsharing may compete with buses and supplement to the metro; and (3) the travel purpose in carsharing is diverse for any land use over a four-week period.",1361-9209,Not found

Based on these data, we estimate a mixed logit model that allows for correlated random effects across fuel types and car segments as well as systematic heterogeneity. The results show that correlation and substitution indeed goes across these dimensions. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) measures are estimated for a variety of attributes. These suggest that the WTP for range varies with fuel types, that the possibility for home charging is highly valued, and that CO2 is a significant concern among individuals in the sample.",1361-9209,Not found

We examine different measures of annual miles driven from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), which includes a self-reported and an imputed measure of annual VMT for a nationally representative sample of U.S. households. We compute two additional estimates from the odometer reading, and the trip diary information contained in the NHTS, respectively. We compare these four measures of annual VMT, seek to identify low/high mileage segments of the fleet, and examine the quality of the data and their internal validity. The price elasticity of VMT (−0.275 to −0.20) is comparable across these four measures. Quantile regressions indicate that the households with higher driving intensity are less responsive to the fuel cost per mile. As cars get older, the difference between the four VMT measures tends to increase; this implies large discrepancies in the CO2 emissions that would be saved, for example, when older cars are removed from the fleet, due to natural turnover or when “cash for clunkers” programs are implemented.",1361-9209,Not found
Land use densification revisited: Nonlinear mediation relationships with car ownership and use,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102985,98,2021-09-01,2021,9,"We revisit the effectiveness of land use densification as a strategy to promote travel sustainability by investigating the nonlinearity and mediation in the effects of residential densities on home-work distance, car ownership, and driving distance. Using a 2017 travel survey dataset in Beijing, we adopt a quadratic generalized multilevel structural equation model to estimate nonlinear and mediating effects simultaneously. Results suggest that the total effects of densities on home-work distance, car ownership, and driving distance are significantly curvilinear. Over-densification may result in marginal or even countervailing travel consequences. The appropriate level of residential density should lie below a threshold at around 18,000 persons/km2. Moreover, the densification policy in low-density neighborhoods may have a trivial direct effect but a significant indirect effect on driving reduction, through the mediation of other travel decisions. These findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating nonlinearity with mediation to evaluate land use policies, particularly in high-density cities.",1361-9209,Not found

Thus, transport planners and electrical grid policymakers need to investigate commuters’ perceptions and behaviours related to EVs and V2G and the effects of incentives, as commuters will eventually switch from CVs to EVs. Our study investigated commuters’ perceptions of and attitudes to V2G technology adoption at workplaces. The main findings are: 1) Commuters are willing to reduce their upfront costs when adopting EVs and associated V2G technologies. 2) Commuters want to reduce their daily transportation costs by using V2G technologies and care less about transport sustainability. 3) The greatest concerns of employers are that the cost of the V2G technology which could be too high and that its internal rate of return is unclear.",1361-9209,Not found
Tire pressure remote monitoring system reducing the rubber waste,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102987,98,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The article presents the newly developed remote monitoring of tire pressure in the car fleet. The use of information from monitoring allows slowing down the tire wear process. The article presents the results of tests of tire pressure and friction wear of the tread made for the car fleet in which monitoring was used and for the fleet in which monitoring was not used. The research results show that the application of the decision-making process based on the results of monitoring allows reducing the amount of waste in the form of prematurely worn tires. The wear of monitored tires amounted to 7–13%, while the wear of unmonitored tires reached even 70%. Assuming that 50% of polish transport companies will effectively use the presented monitoring system, the reduction of generated rubber waste will amount to over 2000 tons less tire waste per year in Poland (Central Europe).",1361-9209,Not found
Transportation satisfaction of disabled passengers: Evidence from a developing country,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102982,98,2021-09-01,2021,9,"While previous studies, often based in developed countries, have established that travel satisfaction contributes to the overall well-being of individuals, there is a shortage of insight regarding travel satisfaction in terms of vulnerable groups in developing countries, including those with lower income, and the impact of this travel satisfaction on the essential areas of life. Accordingly, this study focuses on disabled commuters in Nigeria, one of the world’s largest developing countries. Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with 32 disabled individuals were thematically analysed to investigate the participants’ travel satisfaction. The findings revealed three key themes: (1) mood, which is the internal expression of satisfaction; (2) emotion, which is the external expression of satisfaction; and (3) cognitive action, referring to disabled commuters’ plans of action based on self-evaluation of their satisfaction level. This study makes theoretical contributions to the existing literature on travel satisfaction, travel behaviour and the experiences of disabled commuters. Further, practical implications for transport operators, policy-makers, charity organisations and social enterprises are discussed.",1361-9209,Not found
Examining energy uncertainty in battery bus deployments for transit agencies in California,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102963,98,2021-09-01,2021,9,"Due to the adoption of the Innovative Clean Transit (ICT) regulation, California is transitioning its public transit buses from fossil fuel to zero-emission buses (ZEBs). Due to required high upfront investment for battery electric buses (BEBs), transit agencies must make planning decisions with a system-wide optimization mindset. This study presents a tool to investigate the optimal split between depot charging and opportunity charging for transit networks. A case study was performed on the Unitrans transit system in Davis, California, and it was found that 35 buses would be sufficient to provide the existing level of service over the bus network, which is approximately the same number of buses that Unitrans is currently using to serve those routes. The sensitivity of the relationship between the energy use of BEBs and the deployment decisions was investigated. Decreasing the energy use of the buses by removing the probabilistic effects of drive cycle aggression decreased the maximum required number of buses from 73 to 45 and the interquartile range (IQR) of the number of buses from 10 to 2. The results indicate that a BEB fleet is more sensitive to these changes than a fossil fuel fleet. This relationship needs to be more strongly considered in planning BEB deployments.",1361-9209,Not found
Relationship between tyre cavity noise and road surface characteristics on low-noise pavements,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102971,98,2021-09-01,2021,9,"In this work, a protocol to study Tyre Cavity Noise (TCN) was developed. Using this new method, TCN was measured on 24 different road pavements, together tyre noise emission measured with the Close-Proximity (CPX) method and road texture measurements. The results were used to model the relationship between TCN and road surface parameters. The analysis shows that the Standard Reference Test Tyre’s (SRTT) TCN is correlated to megatexture at low frequencies and that the correlation between TCN and outside noise emission is significant for frequencies lower than 1 kHz. The use of sensors placed inside the tyre for monitoring the acoustic performance of road pavements presents several advantages compared to the CPX method, such as a more compact design, lower cost and lower hazards both for the instrumentation and for other vehicles.",1361-9209,Not found

The container shipping industry’s charter market exhibits a particular type of principal-agent problems deriving from information asymmetries between charterer and owner. We investigate agency theory in transportation science by analyzing the impact of split incentives and information asymmetries on carbon emissions. To construct a robust panel analysis, we collaborated with a leading maritime NGO to source cross-sector operational information for the period 2010–2019. We show that in the case of container shipping, chartering results in about 8% higher carbon emissions, benchmarked against owner-operated vessels, which can be explained as a consequence of principal-agent problems. We also discuss operational cost increases deriving from levying a carbon price in accordance with the Paris Agreement targets.

The model is composed of two modules, which estimate the instantaneous power required for traction and the average power required by the auxiliary systems. The model simulates the instantaneous energy consumption as a function of line and vehicle characteristics, and operating conditions including ambient temperature, bus load and encountered traffic. The model was calibrated against trajectory data from 435 trips, showing an error in reproducing the instantaneous battery state-of-charge of 5.5% in 95% of experiments (2.5% on average). A two-level model validation was performed against data from 110 trips. At a microscopic level, results proved that the calibrated model is robust against variability of line operating conditions. At a macroscopic level, the model was validated against the macroscopic speed-consumption function, showing an error of 6%.",1361-9209,Not found
Evaluation of commuter airplane emissions: A European case study,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102979,98,2021-09-01,2021,9,"We studied a network of commuter flights in Europe ( < 300 n-miles). The analysis of the network identified several connections with very short flights (100–150 n-miles) for which legitimate alternatives may be available. The short-haul network is served by a variety of turbofan and turboprop airplanes; 12 of these airplanes have been used for environmental analysis. Flights were simulated using crowd-sourced ADS-B/Mode-S data, via filtering and other mathematical treatments. Landing and take-off emissions had to be accounted by direct simulation of the missing segments in the flight trajectory. We demonstrate that these phases of flight are essential for accounting of short-haul emissions. Analysis is provided for fuel burn, CO2, NO x , CO, UHC, SO x and non-volatile particulate matter, as function of distance, altitude, city pairs. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the effects of externalities.

Does hedonic framing improve people's willingness-to-pay for vehicle greenhouse gas emissions?,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102973,98,2021-09-01,2021,9,"The objective of this study is to determine the effects of framing of greenhouse gas emissions information on people’s willingness-to-pay for transportation emissions reductions. Six different framing techniques were developed following goal framing theory and applied to the current Natural Resources Canada vehicle labels for gasoline, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles. Previous work applied gain and norm framing. In this experiment, two hedonic framings (e.g., color, emoticons) are added. Discrete choice experiments with 1985 Canadian drivers were used to determine willingness-to-pay for CO2 emissions reductions. Of the frames tested, the two hedonic additions of color and emoticons resulted in the greatest increases in willingness-to-pay. Carbon tax framing was the least influential. Various socio-demographic variables and regional influences were found.

This paper provides empirical evidence on the effect of public transport strikes on Barcelona’s air quality through an econometric analysis. The period analyzed included 147 days of some kind of public transport strike: bus (57), metro (21), trains (71), and tram (4); and also four general strikes. The estimates show that public transport strikes increases the concentration level of SO2, CO, PM10, and NOX throughout the city, especially in the case of metro and RENFE trains.

Does high-speed rail stimulate urban land growth?

Since HSR route planning decisions are influenced by the economic status of cities en route, whether a city gets an HSR station is likely to be endogenous to its economic growth and land development rate. To address this endogeneity, we adopt a Two-period Panel Data Instrumental Variable model using post road network in the Ming Dynasty and locations of military bases as instrumental variables. Results show that being connected to the HSR network on average leads to a 11.2% faster rate of growth of urban built-up areas. More interestingly, we document substantial heterogeneity in this impact based on the size and location of cities. Causes and mechanism for such heterogeneity are also elaborated, together with the policy and planning implications.",1361-9209,Not found

This study considers stochastic credit prices and time-dependent electric vehicle (EV) investment costs to present a novel optimal decision model with three indicators: investment timing, research and development intensity, and product line allocation. This combinatorial optimization problem is solved by developing a genetic algorithm. The simulation result shows that the high profitability of EVs can accelerate electrification, while rapid credit price increases may instead d[1]elay it. Meanwhile, the Corporate Average Fuel Consumption (CFAC) credit rules outperform the New Energy Vehicle (NEV) credit rules in facilitating electrification and driving long-term cumulative EV productions. Interestingly, despite the pressure these rules bring, tightening them is not necessarily beneficial for boosting electrification. Overall, introducing credit ceiling and floor prices, or coordinating policy parameters by steadily tightening CAFC rules while appropriately moderating NEV rules, would effectively accelerate electrification and promote EV productions.",1361-9209,Not found

Existing research has focused exclusively on adjusting timetables after delays occur, or on adjusting them without considering stop plans. By contrast, in this study, we developed a train timetable and stop plan synchronization optimization model that is passenger and energy-saving oriented. The following objectives were considered for minimization: probability of train delays, energy consumption, and travel time of the trains. A parallelism selection genetic algorithm was designed to solve the model. The section of high-speed railway from Nanjing South to Shanghai Hongqiao was utilized as a case study to evaluate the proposed model.

The results indicate that, first, educational attainment is related to hedonic well-being, and transport mode is related to both the commuting experience and hedonic well-being. Furthermore, we found that some combinations of individual characteristics and transport mode are related to the commuting experience and hedonic well-being, but none of them relates to eudaimonic well-being. In addition, there are strong positive correlations between the commuting experience and hedonic well-being, between the commuting experience and eudaimonic well-being, and between hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. We also found that commuting by public transport, walking and cycling is more likely to improve the quality of the commuting experience, and both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being.

(3) In the weak ties represented by neighborhood relations, the stronger the community's low-carbon atmosphere is, the greater the probability of members' low-carbon travel behavior. Our research provides a new perspective to improve the likelihood of low-carbon travel behavior for residents under Chinese society.",1361-9209,Not found
An economic analysis of integrating bike sharing service with metro systems,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103008,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This paper develops an analytical bi-level model to examine the strategic interaction and potential integration between bike sharing operation and metro system operation. In the bi-level problem with a given total travel demand, the lower-level model quantifies users’ equilibrium travel choices and the upper-level model optimizes the operation decisions of the bike sharing operator and metro system operator. We examine different operation regimes, where the bike sharing operator and metro operator may work either independently or jointly. We also conduct numerical analysis in the context of Sydney. The analytical and numerical results show that bike sharing can help reduce total social cost even if the operator maximizes its profit. A more attractive metro service may also help the bike sharing operator to increase its profit. Coordinated operation of bike sharing and metro system can help further reduce total social cost while the bike sharing operator can improve its profit.",1361-9209,Not found
"On undirected trips, satisfaction, and well-being: Evidence from Flanders (Belgium)",10.1016/j.trd.2021.103018,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Despite having the potential to improve subjective well-being, satisfaction with undirected travel, or travel for its own sake (e.g. taking a walk, bike ride, or joy ride), has not yet been empirically investigated. Using mean-comparison and generalized linear regression models, this study analyzes 1579 undirected trips made by 852 respondents to a survey in Flanders, Belgium during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (18 March – 4 May 2020). Undirected travel was found to be longer in duration and more satisfying than results from directed trips in previous literature, with an indication that higher levels of physical activity are important to satisfaction. Undirected travel satisfaction was found to have a clear positive relationship to well-being. As these trips are often active and were found to imply a positive utility of travel, understanding them can be important to policy goals regarding health, sustainability, and improving individual well-being.",1361-9209,Not found
Alternative electrification pathways for light-duty vehicles in the European transport sector,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103005,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"There is a wide consensus that a fundamental technology shift within the light duty vehicles (LDVs) sector is necessary to achieve the emissions reductions required for the Paris Agreement’s targets, but substantial controversy prevails about the most suitable strategy. While some decision makers favor a transition to battery electric vehicles, others advocate for fuel cell vehicles and e-fuels. These strategies differ markedly in terms of consumer acceptance and implications for the energy system. We explore a range of electrification pathways in Europe until 2050. Direct electrification leads to a strong reduction in direct CO2 emissions of LDVs, with electric vehicles reaching 90% of sales in 2050. Indirect electrification places substantially higher pressure on the supply sector, with almost double the primary energy demand relative to direct electricity use. In addition, the implementation of complementary policies addressing perceived inconvenience markups for alternative mobility is crucial to initiate the mobility transformation.",1361-9209,Not found
Investigating the determinants of shipowners’ emission abatement solutions for newbuilding vessels,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102989,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Because of the long lifetime of newbuilding vessels, shipowners' emission abatement solutions will have a profound impact on the greening transition of the shipping industry. A multinominal logit model is developed to identify the key determinants that affect the shipowners' choice of the solutions. New findings include: (1) Alternative fuels (e.g. liquefied natural gas) are the most attractive choice for gas ships and pure car carriers; and dry bulk ships and crude tankers prefer to use low-sulfur fuels. (2) Singaporean and Japanese shipowners are more likely to adopt the alternative fuels. (3) The IMO 2020 cap has significantly affected shipowners’ preference for scrubbers but not for alternative fuels. It is well known that economic factors affecting a shipowner’s decisions include freight rate and bunker cost but these factors weakly influence the emission abatement solution choice for new ships. This research provides helpful insights for the policymaker to guide shipowners to invest in more eco-friendly vessels and assist various stakeholders in forming efficient decisions.",1361-9209,Not found
Optimal charging strategy for large-scale electric buses considering resource constraints,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103009,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"The large-scale application of electric buses highlights a series of practical problems, such as high charging costs, unreasonable utilization of charging resources, and chaotic charging schedules. In this study, a mixed integer programming model was first proposed to reduce the total charging cost of electric bus fleets by optimizing the charging power and charging time. Meanwhile, to improve the efficiency of the model under large-scale charging scenarios, a column-generation-based algorithm is developed to decompose the original model into a master problem and several subproblems, where each electric bus’s charging strategy is solved in an independent subproblem to guarantee a stable operational bus fleet schedule and to avoid intermittent charging. An experimental analysis is carried out. The results show that the optimal charging strategy can reduce the charging cost by approximately 36.1% compared with the uncontrolled charging strategy, which carries the potential to be applied in large-scale bus fleet operation.",1361-9209,Not found
Experimental analysis and quantification of air infiltration into a passenger car cabin,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103006,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Nowadays, air quality in closed environments is of major interest, particularly in very small volumes such as car cabins. In typical driving conditions, ambient air enters by infiltration as the vehicle speed increases. In order to satisfy more ambitious requirements on air quality and energy savings, it is necessary to evaluate the infiltration risk. At first, an experimental method is created to identify the infiltration path in the cabin of a moving car. On a modern electric vehicle, the privileged path is observed at the front of the cabin near the feet of the front passengers. A second experimental campaign is performed to quantify the infiltration flow rate. Results show that the flow rate is not negligible as it can reach several dozen kilograms per hour. The ventilation settings (blower speed and recirculation ratio) can be managed to reduce or even completely remove infiltration in some cases.",1361-9209,Not found

It is shown that the speed-power exponent is significantly lower than 3 at speed intervals below the design speed. This finding, including the study itself, affects the environmental discussions related to slow steaming, since it implies that slow steaming will not be as good as often stated. As such, the study imparts attention to speed optimisation, rather than reduction, in the political and environmental debate focused on the reduction of carbon emissions from shipping.",1361-9209,Not found
Investigating commuters’ satisfaction with public transit: A latent class modeling approach,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103015,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This study explores the factors associated with commute satisfaction of public transit users in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, identifying the critical role of commuters’ attitudes in influencing their commute satisfaction. Using a latent class ordered probit model, the study identifies two latent segments—optimistic multitasker (Class 1) and dissatisfied commuter (Class 2)—assuming that the association between determinants and satisfaction with commute could depend highly on attitudes. A majority of transit commuters (71.8%) belong to Class 1, meaning that most Seoul commuters are satisfied with their commute and use their travel time productively. Moreover, in comparing the two-class profiles, Class 1 commuters tend to be more satisfied with their lifestyle, perceive themselves as healthier, have a positive personality, and are more satisfied with their commute. Such empirical evidence demonstrates the existence of taste heterogeneity in determining commute satisfaction and the role of attitudes in that mechanism.",1361-9209,Not found
Environmental and economic evaluations of treatment strategies for pavement network performance-based planning,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103016,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Performance-based planning is an important tool for allocating treatment resources across a pavement network from a set of candidate treatments with a budget constraint. Existing research focuses on improving allocation decisions through changes in the optimization algorithm without considering the consequences of how optimization analyses are framed. In this paper, both environmental and economic performance is evaluated for different problem framing in the form of different treatment strategies that consist of treatment materials, treatment types, and evaluation period. Results show that the proposed strategy that uses both concrete and asphalt, different treatment types, and a long evaluation period could reduce GHG emissions and improve pavement network performance based on the Iowa U.S. route network. Compared to a conventional 5-year asphalt-only strategy, proposed strategy can accomplish this with an annual budget that is 32% smaller and reduce associated GHG emissions by 21%.

How do built environments measured at two scales influence PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations?,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103014,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of built environments measured in inter-city and intra-city on PM2.5 concentrations in South Korean cities using a hierarchical linear regression (HLR) model. Results showed that a higher population density was associated with lower PM2.5 concentrations in the inter-city. In the intra-city, higher road density and the presence of more emission facilities were associated with higher PM2.5 concentrations, while the existence of larger green areas was associated with lower PM2.5 concentrations. This study also suggests that when intra-city physical environments are not controlled for, the effects of inter-city built environments on PM2.5 concentrations might be overestimated. We recommend that urban planners and decision-makers establish compact development strategies for inter-city with a high population density. For intra-city, land use plans and urban design strategies should be established to avoid neighboring emission sources and increase green areas.",1361-9209,Not found
The impact of an EU maritime emissions trading system on oil trades,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102992,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Maritime transportation will be included in 2022 into the European Union Emission Trading System (ETS). There is however a limited knowledge on the impact of this inclusion for shipping markets and operators; and on whether it can bring enough incentives for carbon abatement measures. We contribute to this debate in developing a methodology to assess these impacts. Our method is applied to a sample of over 38,000 European voyages carried out by oil tankers from 2017 to 2019, during which an estimation of 60 million tonnes of CO2 were generated by EU-related voyages. With a carbon allowance price at USD 10–50 per tonne, we estimate that the industry could contribute up to 0.3–1.4 billion USD per year. We show that even with a low price, the ETS provides sufficient incentives for specific abatement measures, and in particular, for wind-assistance technologies.",1361-9209,Not found

In this regard, we propose a market segmentation for incentivising sustainable transport policies. Our analysis builds from the responses of 1,041 car owners towards environmentally friendly transport alternatives in a survey issued in the five largest Colombian metropolitan areas: Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga. Using the collected data, we estimated a Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model to evaluate individual attitudes towards the environment, green transport policies, car use, and technology. A cluster analysis based on the MIMIC results identified three groups: Traditionalists, Green Conscious and All Matters. Results make the contradiction between car attachment and environmental concern evident. The lower the environmental concern, the higher the attachment to the car. However, the differences between Traditionalists and All Matters are less pronounced. Finally, we proposed sustainable strategies considering the heterogeneities of each group, analysed the implications of developing custom-made actions and marketing strategies for promoting sustainable transport policies, considering the interests and characteristics of each targeted group in the population.",1361-9209,Not found
Carbon emission and cost analysis of vehicle technologies for urban taxis,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102994,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Our study compared vehicle technologies to reduce the carbon emissions of the Hong Kong taxi fleet.

Our result highlights that FCEVs fueled with hydrogen from renewables and EVs with battery swap stations have lower abatement costs (i.e., cost incurred/carbon saved). The selection of a relatively low-cost option between EVs with battery swap stations and FCEVs with hydrogen from renewables depends on the reduction of electricity carbon intensity versus whether an economic and reliable import of hydrogen from renewables can be secured. Taxi miles traveled affect the vehicle technology abatement cost ranking. Overall, our study provides insight into sustainable urban taxi transition.",1361-9209,Not found

If the major mode shift comes from public transit, owned bike, or walking, the benefits will be more limited. The goal of this paper is to identify the factors influencing mode substitution, defined here as the mode that is replaced when bike-share is used. The analysis shows that the dominant mode substitution for trips of less than 1 mile for most trip purposes is walking. Long trips and non-commute trips that start at non-commercial locations are likely to represent car substitution and some groups, such as women, non-membership holders and those who have a private car, are more likely to report car substitution for any trip purpose. These results provide guidance for designing bike-share operations and policies to enhance car substitution.",1361-9209,Not found
Understanding factors influencing shared e-scooter usage and its impact on auto mode substitution,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102991,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Shared e-scooter is a fairly new transportation mode that emerged in late 2017. Since then, it has gained popularity around the world; however, it also has spiraled into disarray in many cities due to the lack of e–scooter regulations and improper parking and riding behaviors. Limited understanding of shared e–scooters restrains policymakers from developing more effective regulations and promoting this sustainable transportation mode. This study takes a step towards understanding e-scooter user behaviors by investigating factors that influence e-scooter sharing usage and auto mode substitution. Survey data were collected from shared e-scooter users, and random parameter models were applied to explore the factors influencing e-scooter sharing usage and mode substitution. Factors considered in models include sociodemographic information, user behaviors, trip purposes, and health indicators. Model results identify several factors that significantly influence shared e-scooter usage, including user gender, helmet use, exposure to shared e-scooters, ownership of an e-scooter, riding locations, opinions on speed limits, and trip purposes. Contributing factors for auto substitution suggest that shared e-scooters potentially are competing with TNC/taxi, lower cost, and social/entertainment trip purpose, and user households with multiple vehicles contribute to private vehicle substitution. Research outcomes suggest that shared e-scooters could play a significant role in urban transportation sustainability. Insights related to better practices for e-scooter regulations and planning are discussed to help cities improve shared e-scooter program performance and make it a more sustainable transportation mode.",1361-9209,Not found
Energy consumption and emissions dynamics of US domestic intercity air travel,10.1016/j.trd.2021.102993,99,2021-10-01,2021,10,"Domestic intercity air travel accounts for nearly 80% of all air travel in the U.S. As low-cost airlines and economic growth have increased the affordability of intercity air travel, the benefits to travelers and cities are touted by most. Yet, an accounting of the energy consumption and emissions from domestic intercity air travel is rarely discussed. This paper fills that gap and provides an analysis of the trends in fuel consumption and emissions by intercity air travel as well as an analysis of the contributing factors to these emissions. Using flight tracking and carrier data, emissions per passenger are found to have declined by 40% over the past two decades while total emissions have increased by 10% over the past 8 years. A decomposition analysis of the market factors highlights changes in route frequency, fleet deployment, and fleet efficiency as the leading factors contributing to the decline of intercity emissions.",1361-9209,Not found

FUERs and potential reductions from eco-driving were quantified based on simulated trajectories. Hotspots were defined as sections with ≥ 90th percentile of section-average FUERs by species. A few key variables explain 74–80% of variability in mesoscopic and microscopic FUERs. On average, FUERs are 7–8 times greater for hotspots than non-hotspots. Eco-driving was estimated to reduce segment-average FUERs by 3–33% and eliminate 2–11% hotspots. However, mesoscale oriented eco-driving can, at some locations, increase microscopic FUERs. The approach is adaptable to other diesel commuter rail systems.",1361-9209,Not found

Passenger cars and light commercial category vehicles in the Turkish vehicle fleet are analyzed in terms of size (sales and scrappage rates), age distribution, fuel type, engine displacement, and mileage. The distributions based on these parameters are forecasted for the 2020–2030 period under five alternative policy scenarios for Turkey.

We propose a current scenario of traffic volume and pedestrianized streets, and another set of exploratory scenarios. The methodology uses a traffic simulation model, followed by the estimation of the emissions at street level and their dispersion. These results are crossed with pedestrian routes to estimate the reduction in pedestrian exposure to these pollutants. The results show that improvements are generalized in scenarios where traffic is reduced. The results serve to analyse the rate of the decrease in pedestrian exposure to these pollutants and can provide evidence-based geographically-dimensioned information to identify priority actions.",1361-9209,Not found
Optimizing electric bus charging infrastructure considering power matching and seasonality,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103057,100,2021-11-01,2021,11,"In this research, a novel optimization model for electric bus charging station location, charger configuration, charging time and vehicle flow is developed considering power matching and seasonality. The seasonality highlights the effect of air temperature on the battery performances of electric buses. Power matching between batteries and chargers jointly determines the maximum battery acceptance rates of electric buses, and this consideration results in nonlinear constraints. A surrogate-based optimization approach is proposed to solve the mixed integer nonlinear program efficiently. The optimization model is demonstrated on a sub-transit network including 17 bus lines in Beijing. The results reveal significant performance differences regarding vehicle scheduling and charging among different bus fleets in the BEB-based transit system. The interesting findings on the distribution of vehicle flows for charging provide strong evidence to consider powering match in the bus charging infrastructure layout.",1361-9209,Not found
Transport infrastructure asset resilience: Managing government capabilities,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103072,100,2021-11-01,2021,11,"The management of the organisational capabilities needed to ensure the resilience of transport infrastructure assets is a challenge for governments worldwide. However, an absence of critical research in this area has exacerbated this challenge. The upshot, in this instance, has been the inability of governments to engender and enact an effective transport resilience strategy. This paper aims to fill this void and address the following research questions: (1) How do government organisational capabilities interact with one another to determine the resilience of transport projects? and (2) What is the best way to manage these organisational capabilities to aid a resilience strategy? Using Social Network Analysis, seven transport infrastructure case studies that were significantly impacted by natural hazards in the United Kingdom were used to answer the proposed research questions. The analysis revealed five inter-related factors are required to ensure the resilience of transport assets: (1) leadership; (2) reflexive (organisational) learning; (3) support from senior management; (4) a culture adept to resilience; and (5) continuous improvement (also investment) in asset absorbability, adaptability and vulnerability. The original contribution of this research is threefold: (1) a network providing a systematic visualisation of the interactions between organisational capabilities influencing asset resilience; (2) the prioritisation of governmental capabilities; and (3) the development of management framework providing a pathway that can accommodate environmental changes and asset resilience.",1361-9209,Not found

An accurate assessment of the negative external costs will help decision-makers sustainably regulate such services. As a first step, this research develops an agent-based simulation of a hyper-local food delivery system. Using primary data from Kolkata, India, the simulator estimates the fleet size, the average distance traveled per order, the average number of orders delivered and the average idle time spent by a delivery worker, at varying order volumes. The negative externalities estimated are the emissions per order and the spatio-temporal parking demand generated by the delivery fleet. The results show that at an order volume of 2100, on average, the distance traveled per order is 5.85 km, the orders delivered per worker is 15, the idle time spent is 59.2% and each delivery results in the emission of 163.08 gm CO2.",1361-9209,Not found

EN16258 is currently the most internationally accepted standard for transport and logistics. Moreover, most emission standards have been developed by associations for a single mode of transport or for specific regions (e.g., North America). This research suggests recommendations for a global standard for all modes of transport based on EN16258 for freight/logistics transportation. First, the most relevant standards and methods are addressed and explained. Based on ISO IWA 16, they are then compared and combined into a single overview. A case study of the introduction of CarbonCare (emission calculator) and its global transport customers were taken into account to incorporate practical guidelines for a blueprint.

Factors influencing shared micromobility services: An analysis of e-scooters and bikeshare,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103047,100,2021-11-01,2021,11,"This study explores how factors, including weather, day of the week, holidays, and special events, influence the trip frequency of two micromobility modes, shared e-scooters and bikeshare, in Louisville, Kentucky. Negative binomial generalized additive models (NBGAM) were estimated to model the trip frequency of each mode. NBGAM provides a rigorous modeling approach that accounts for temporal autocorrelation among variables. While results showed some differences exist between how various factors impact shared e-scooters and bikeshare trips, several similarities emerged between modes. Rain reduced trips for both, reducing bikeshare by 17% and shared e-scooters by 16%. Mondays, Thursdays, Friday, and Saturdays had increased use of both micromobility services though Tuesdays and Wednesdays only saw significant increases in bikeshare ridership. This study contributes to the existing literature in the micromobility realm by quantifying and comparing time-dependent relationships for e-scooters and bikeshare.

The depot and charging facility location problem for electrifying urban bus services,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103053,100,2021-11-01,2021,11,"The transition from diesel-consuming buses to electric ones entails the problem of determining the locations of bus depots, charging and maintenance stations, which can directly affect the operating cost and efficiency of a bus system. The problem also involves practical concerns, including the selection of fleet size (of electric buses), land acquisition, bus allocation, and the associated deadhead mileage. This study develops an optimization model to systematically locate depots and relevant facilities for deploying mixed types of vehicles. Further, a decomposition-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to enhance computational efficiency. A case study is performed using the data of a bus operator in Taiwan. Sensitivity and scenario analyses are conducted, evaluating major cost components and identifying the factors that affect the trade-offs between them.

Mining dockless bikeshare data for insights into cyclist behavior and preferences: Evidence from the Boston region,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103044,100,2021-11-01,2021,11,"Emerging micromobility services provide not only new transportation options, but also valuable sources of data for researchers and planners seeking to understand traveler behavior and preferences and to improve transportation networks. Dockless systems for shared bicycles and electric scooters have recently begun operating in many American cities, providing data not only on trip start and end, but also on the route followed. In this study, we analyze data from more than 110,000 dockless bikeshare trips in Boston’s suburbs. About 15% of trip ends were within 100 m of a transit station, indicating that bikeshare serves many more functions than access to transit. More than 40% ended in a town or village center, suggesting that bikeshare may support the local economy. From examining GPS traces, it was clear that – contrary to the assumptions of common bike routing algorithms – bike riders often use sidewalks, other footways and soft-surfaced paths, parking lots, and driveways, and 36% ride the wrong way on one-way streets. An examination of the streets with high contraflow volumes indicates two common profiles. One is streets whose travel channel is so narrow that either the bike or vehicle has to pull into a parking lane to let the other pass; those streets typically have low traffic speeds and very low traffic volumes. The other is streets whose travel channel is wide enough for a bike and car to pass without either yielding to the other; they typically have greater vehicular speed and volume, but still only one lane. After classifying streets by level of traffic stress, we find that only 7 percent of trips use exclusively low-stress links, and that about 40 percent of bike-miles are ridden on low-stress links. These low percentages are consistent with an underdeveloped bike network that forces riders to use through streets for all except ultra-local trips; it may also reflect a prevalence of sidewalk riding on major arterials.",1361-9209,Not found

The SEM-Partial Least Squares path revealed that sensitivity, exposure hours, profession, sleeping disorder, and education significantly affect annoyance. The variables, such as age, experience, gender, and Leq are found to be inconsequential. The measurement model confirmed 67.5 percent of the variance in annoyance. However, the effectiveness of the Artificial Neural Network model is justified by observing the Mean Square Error and Root Mean Square Error values, and the model's accuracy is 71.2 percent. Furthermore, the feed-forward back-propagation ANN approach confirmed that noise sensitivity is the most important predictor of noise annoyance, followed by exposure hours, profession, sleeping disorder, and education.

In situ noise measurements were performed next to a primary road under free flowing traffic where tire‐road noise emission dominates, while simultaneously monitoring the air and pavement temperature. The broadband results showed a variation in noise level with temperature, with a ratio of −0.058 ± 0.007 dBA/°C for the pavement temperature and −0.161 ± 0.020 dBA/°C for the air temperature. A 1/3 octave band analysis revealed a decrease in sound level with increasing temperature in the fundamental bands of road traffic noise emission, and similar behaviour and values to that observed in the broadband analysis. The physical media in which temperature is measured appears to be important. Several implications may arise from this work in regard to reference standards for noise evaluation, calculation and measurement.",1361-9209,Not found

This study investigates the relationship between CINEVs and WTBEVs by accommodating the moderating role of the Big Five personality traits. Results are based on a sample of 624 respondents in the seven largest Indian cities by employing a comprehensive questionnaire survey. Structural equation modeling is used to test the formulated hypotheses. The results highlight that CINEVs is directly related to WTBEVs. We further add to the existing pool of knowledge by providing empirical evidence that openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness positively moderate the relationship between CINEVs and WTBEVs, whereas neuroticism negatively moderates this relationship.

Focusing on the explanatory variable of the price of aviation emissions allowances, the analysis supports our research hypothesis. The findings indicate that rising allowance prices contribute to the reduction of emissions, an increase in the EUAA price by €1 typically partially corresponding to a decrease in GHG emissions by 7.9 kg of CO2 per capita.

One contributing factor to this limited service are issues in existing transit planning methods; serving the reverse commute with transit requires new methods and data sources that complement decision making based on ridership and revealed demand. We utilize administrative origin–destination data from the Philadelphia area that measures commuter flows across all travel modes, rather than just those who already use transit, to capture the potential demand for reverse commuting transit service. We develop an index to highlight target areas for new services, describe geographies for intervention, and utilize negative binomial regression models to analyze key covariates of the reverse commute. Our approach advances a new methodological framework that employs spatially-oriented analyses and open data and tools to generate actionable insights to better serve reverse commuters.",1361-9209,Not found

Previous studies never questioned the use of ideal travel as a reference point to assess travel satisfaction. We assess how and to what extent changes in commute dissonance, among other determinants, affect commute satisfaction by applying the prospect theory with alternative reference points. Results indicate that negative dissonant commuters (i.e., actual commute time > ideal) are significantly less satisfied with their commute, but the opposite does not hold. By using data from a retrospective survey among staff of the relocated McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, Canada, we found how the reference point of the previous commute time is more salient and impactful.

Structural Equation Modeling was used to evaluate the proposed model. Besides the original TAM constructs, subjective norms were found to be the strongest predictor of intention. Environmental awareness was also a significant predictor. Results from open-ended questions revealed that most participants believed using e-scooters instead of motorcycles and private cars on short-distance trips could help the environment, and its positive effects outweigh their disadvantages.

The results suggest that compared with commuting duration (6.71%) and specific BE characteristics (ranging between 4.77% and 8.86%), household income has the largest relative contribution (14.57%). All BE characteristics show a nonlinear relationship with happiness. The commuting duration shows nonlinear relationships with happiness, and the nonlinear patterns vary across commuting modes.

Perception vs. reality: The aviation noise complaint effect on home prices,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103011,100,2021-11-01,2021,11,Intercity air transportation has grown rapidly in recent decades and creates significant noise pollution that affects health. Previous research quantifies the losses that are capitalized into home values. Much research relies heavily on spatially restrictive noise contour plots to identify the house price discounts and determine economic damages. We break new ground by investigating whether residential noise complaints can offer insights on aircraft noise pollution and housing price impacts experienced by residents near Minneapolis-Saint-Paul International Airport outside of contour boundaries. Our findings indicate noise complaints are a reliable measure of residential noise annoyance and have a significant adverse effect on home prices extending nearly twice as far (10 km) as contours. Reevaluating economic damages based on our results indicates contour-based calculations severely underestimate aircraft-noise-pollution-induced losses incurred by homeowners and suggests $154 million of $167 million in post-abatement damages are borne by residents located outside the regulated Minneapolis contour area.,1361-9209,Not found

The characteristics of how SCFs change in response to changes in VSP distributions and emission rates are discussed in detail. The results show that distortions in VSP distributions and emission rates significantly affect SCFs. A 1% change of the fraction in a VSP bin or a 1% change in the average emission rate in a VSP bin can cause 1.3–3.2% or 0.08–0.13% of changes in SCFs, respectively.

The qualitative model included attributes influencing the success of carsharing and possible policy interventions. The results illustrated the effectiveness of GMB as a participatory approach for transport planning.",1361-9209,Not found
An advanced climate resilience indicator framework for airports: A UK case study,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103099,101,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Due to increased extreme weather events, climate adaptation has become an essential issue to be addressed by all transport infrastructures, including airports. This paper aims to develop a Climate Resilience Indicator (CRI) framework for assessing airport climate resilience, which for the first time, considers: climate exposure, vulnerability and adaptive capacity simultaneously and advances the development of climate risk analysis of airports to a point where their adaptation and resilience can be quantified under uncertainty in data. Climate-related data was collected from multiple sources to evaluate an airport's performance against each indicator. An evidential reasoning (ER) approach is used to evaluate each airport by integrating all the indicators to derive its final CRI score. The findings provide valuable insights into how urgently an airport needs to deal with climate change and reveal information to help with resource allocation for different airports nationally through proactive adaptation planning.",1361-9209,Not found
The influence of ride-hailing on travel frequency and mode choice,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103125,101,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Using data derived from 597 face-to-face interviews with ride-hailing users in Chengdu (China), we examined the influence of ride-hailing on travel frequency and mode choice and further analyzed what the main determinants for these are. The results indicate that 16.8% of the respondents increase their frequency of trips because of the adoption of ride-hailing services, suggesting a complementary effect of ride-hailing on travel. Meanwhile, the use of traditional travel modes is considerably substituted by ride-hailing services. Particularly, around half of the respondents indicated a substitution of ride-hailing for sustainable modes (i.e., public transit, cycling, and walking), which may thus generate environmental problems (e.g., increasing greenhouse gas emissions). Additionally, regression outcomes show that higher accessibility to bus stations is negatively correlated with the shift from sustainable modes to ride-hailing. Therefore, optimizing the access to bus facilities may be effective to cope with potential transportation problems posed by ride-hailing.",1361-9209,Not found
Purification effect on runoff pollution of porous concrete with nano-TiO<inf>2</inf> photocatalytic coating,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103101,101,2021-12-01,2021,12,"With the rapid development of cities, more attention has been paid to the stormwater runoff pollution on roads. In this paper, a kind of photocatalytic water purification pavement coated with nano-TiO2 was developed, which could improve the water purification performance of porous concrete. Through removal rate analysis of three typical pollutants, the improvement of its water purification performance was evaluated. The skid resistance of road surface and durability of purification effect were also studied by using pendulum apparatus and artificial accelerated aging method. The results showed that the removal rates of COD, TP and NH3-N could reach 50%, 60% and 40%, respectively. The application of photocatalytic coating would reduce skid resistance of pavement relatively. Besides, appropriate increase of nano-TiO2 content will improve the weather resistance. This study will provide useful insights for the preparation of nano-TiO2 photocatalytic coatings for porous cement concrete to improve the water purification effect of roads.",1361-9209,Not found
Passenger car cost development through 2050,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103110,101,2021-12-01,2021,12,"For passenger cars, various powertrains compete in terms of reducing environmentally-harmful emissions, smooth integration into future energy systems and economic performance. Developing a sound long-term projection of the total cost of ownership (TCO), however, remains challenging. Highlights of our present assessment, include a detailed, component-based manufacturing and operating cost analysis, as well as simulation-based component scaling and fuel consumption analysis. We apply this methodology to eight passenger car concepts based on batteries, fuel cells and combustion engines, spanning four passenger car segments and five different market development scenarios through 2050. With respect to the TCO, our analysis reveals that fully-electric powertrains utilizing batteries (BEVs) and fuel cells (FCEVs) offer the lowest-cost solutions. FCEVs exhibit small but robust benefits compared to BEVs. BEVs will undergo the earliest break-even point with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), already before 2030. Different market development scenarios would not significantly affect the long-term results.",1361-9209,Not found
Association between perceived transportation disadvantages and opportunity inaccessibility: A social equity study,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103119,101,2021-12-01,2021,12,"This study gathered empirical evidence of the associations between perceived transportation disadvantages and travel time-based opportunity inaccessibility. Based on an online survey with a representative sample in South Carolina, we identified three latent factors of perceived transportation disadvantages: high travel costs and efforts (e.g., money and time spent for travel), limited travel ability, and safety concerns. We also constructed the factor of perceived inaccessibility of various essential opportunities based on preferred travel times. By estimating a structural equation model, we found that travel time-based opportunity inaccessibility perception was positively associated with perceived transportation disadvantages such as high travel costs/efforts and limited travel ability. The factor of safety concerns did not directly affect the time-based inaccessibility perception but had positive covariance with the factors of high costs/efforts and limited ability. Perceived inaccessibility was distributed inequitably across population groups (e.g., race and age) and associated with the built environment. The paper provides insights into the multidimensional interrelationships between the perception-based factors of disadvantages and inaccessibility from a new perspective and discusses the policy implications for improving transportation equity.",1361-9209,Not found
The impact of shared mobility services on housing values near subway stations,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103097,101,2021-12-01,2021,12,"With the rapid development of smart phones and mobile internets, shared mobility services have become increasingly popular among travellers, and may influence housing values through their effects on people’s demand on subway services. This paper makes one of the first attempts to investigate the aggregate impact of different shared mobility services on housing values near subway stations, by conducting an empirical analysis on a dataset of apartment resale records in Beijing. We find that, the on-demand ride service offered by transportation network companies (like Didi) is more of a substitute than a complement to subway, leading to a reduction in house price in the vicinity of subway stations. In contrast, dockless bikesharing service brings about a greater complementary effect than substitution effect on subway usage, resulting in house price appreciation in the proximity of subway station. The effects are found to be heterogenous at different temporal and spatial scales.",1361-9209,Not found

By using literature on spatial inequality and unequal mobility access, we provide new insights into the urban geographies of car sharing. We draw on register data of members and vehicles of station-based car sharing for Oslo, Norway, spatially coupled with population composition, urban form and public transport accessibility ratios. We find both the demand and supply of station-based car sharing to be unevenly distributed. Some of the most profound contributors to car sharing demand include middle income levels, middle and higher levels of education, higher shares of the population working in cultural sectors, higher shares of men, higher shares of multifamily housing, and higher strengths of the public transport regime compared to that of the private car.

Spatial disparity of individual and collective walking behaviors: A new theoretical framework,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103096,101,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The creation of walkable environments, and the promotion of walkability for health and environmental benefits have been widely advocated. However, the term “walkability” is often associated with two related but distinct walking behaviors: individual and collective walking behaviors. It is unclear whether spatial disparity exists between them, and whether built environment characteristics have distinctive effects on them. This research was the first to explore the spatial disparity between the two types of walking behaviors. Collective walking behaviors were measured using the citywide pedestrian volume, extracted from 219,248 street view images. Individual walking behaviors were measured form a population-level survey. Spatial mismatches were found between the two types of walking behaviors and built environment elements had stronger associations with collective walking behaviors. Therefore, it is prudent to theoretically differentiate collective and individual walking behaviors, and targeted planning policies must be developed to promote one or both types of walking behaviors.",1361-9209,Not found

Vehicle configuration parameters, including vehicle body, battery, tire, transmission, were chosen for the simulation in ADvanced VehIcle SimulatOR (ADVISOR) software package, by which the estimated benefits and costs by optimizing each parameter were approximated to provide a benchmark for choosing the controlled variable during the optimization. Vehicle mass, rolling resistance coefficient and accessory power were selected as the controlled variables for the cost-benefit analysis with the vehicle life cycle driving mileage as the benchmark, reducing the short-term profit limitation of the optimization evaluation.

The main objective of this paper is to explore alternative road sharing solutions to reducing externalities from individual transportation in intercity corridors without increasing the cost each user would pay to travel through the Motorway. Specifically, it intends to assess how generalised GPS-based toll systems can reduce system emissions compared with a flat-electronic collection system. Simulation experiment results on a case study in Portugal comprising alternative routes of approximately 60 km show the proposed GPS-based toll (with different strategies for peak and off-peak hour) can influence the total emissions with only a small decrease of the total revenue without sacrificing the cost that each user would pay to travel through this corridor.",1361-9209,Not found

In this natural experimental study, we assessed the effects of a large-scale greenway intervention (i.e., the opening of East Lake greenway) on walking behaviors in Wuhan, China. Longitudinal survey data on 1,020 participants were collected before and after the intervention in 2016 and 2019, respectively. The results of the mixed-effect difference-in-difference (DID) models showed that the greenway intervention had a significantly positive effect on the walking time, especially for residents living within two kilometers from the greenway. Furthermore, women and socio-economically disadvantaged people benefited most from the greenway implementation regarding walking time.

Aviation fuel and emissions in air markets with interregional passenger leakage,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103092,101,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Attractive air services at large airports in the U.S., over the last two decades, have encouraged interregional air passenger leakage, a phenomenon in which air travelers abandon their nearby small airports in favor of starting their air journeys from large hub airports farther away. The disparities between small and large airports, in terms of air services, are expected to widen because of COVID-19 and further exacerbate passenger leakage. This study estimates the differences in mean aviation fuel consumed and pollutants emitted between air routes from small and large airports in the U.S. Midwest region – routes that are known to be contested according to analysis of an air ticket dataset. Findings indicate that air journeys originating from large airports result in 24% less aviation fuel consumption and considerably lower emissions at the passenger-kilometer level, offering additional insight toward better understanding the environmental impact of a geographically shifting air travel demand.",1361-9209,Not found
Infrastructure enabled and electrified automation: Charging facility planning for cleaner smart mobility,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103079,101,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Due to higher energy efficiency and lower emissions, electric vehicles (EVs) have become attractive transportation means in developing cleaner mobility systems.

For infrastructure enabled automation (IEA), charging facility planning is required to accommodate the increasing AEV charging demand. The planning process must also account for their impact on the power grid. This study presents an integrated demand coverage optimization model over a coupled power-transportation (CPT) network. This model aims to pinpoint candidate locations of AEV charging stations that would serve the most charging demand in the transportation network, considering the upcoming technologies in AEV also will affect the charging behavior that can influence the charging system.

Reduction of maritime GHG emissions and the potential role of E-fuels,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103075,101,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Maritime transport accounts for around 3% of global anthropogenic Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Well-to-Wake) and these emissions must be reduced with at least 50% in absolute values by 2050, to contribute to the ambitions of the Paris agreement (2015). Zero carbon fuels made from renewable sources (hydro, wind or solar) are by many seen as the most promising option to deliver the desired GHG reductions. For the maritime sector, these fuels come in two forms: First as E-Hydrogen or E-Ammonia; Second as Hydrocarbon E-fuels in the form of E-Diesel, E-LNG, or E-Methanol. We evaluate emissions, energy use and cost for E-fuels and find that the most robust path to these fuels is through dual-fuel engines and systems to ensure flexibility in fuel selection, to prepare for growing supplies and lower risks.

Acceptance of climate adaptation measures for transport operations: Conceptual and empirical overview,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103068,101,2021-12-01,2021,12,"Transport operations are climate sensitive. Despite this, scientific literature and corporate practice present little evidence on how corporate actors use climate adaptation measures to prepare their transport operations for climate change. This paper explores two research questions: How can the acceptance among corporate decision-makers towards climate adaptation measures for their transport operations be explained? Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Diffusion of Innovations we develop a theoretical framework for dealing with climate adaptation measures for transport operations (step 1). We support the use of this framework through a literature review (1989–2020) (step 2) and semi-structured interviews with German companies that have implemented best practice measures (step 3). The results show that the handling of climate adaptation measures for transport operations can be described in three acceptance phases: acceptance of attitude, action, and use. We conclude that these phases determine the approaches required for promoting climate change adaptation.",1361-9209,Not found

PM0.25-1 concentrations in subway accounted for 56%–63% of all size fractions, while PM2.5-10 dominated PM0.25-2.5 in other modes. The highest particle counts were observed in the size range of 0.25–0.5 µm. PM concentrations on weekends were higher than those on weekdays. Peak concentrations were usually recorded in the morning on weekends but in the evening during weekdays. Females had higher exposure risks than males for the same distance covered using shared bikes due to longer travel duration.

Results suggest that e-scooters have both competing and complementary effects on transit and bikeshare. The service areas of the three modes largely overlap, and most e-scooter trips could have been made by transit or bikeshare. A travel-time-based analysis further reveals that when choosing e-scooters over transit, travelers pay a price premium but save some travel time. The price premium was greater during COVID-19 but the associated travel-time savings were smaller. This implies that public health considerations rather than time-cost tradeoffs were the main determinant of travel behavior during COVID-19. In addition, we find that e-scooters enhance mobility services for some underserved neighborhoods. Before COVID-19, about 10% of all e-scooter trips were taken to connect with the Metrorail system.",1361-9209,Not found

An effective algorithm is tailored to identify the operational modes of tugs (berthing, un-berthing, and maneuver). For cargo ships and passenger ships, three key operational modes are considered (transit, maneuver, and hotelling). Based on the identified operational modes, different methods (propeller-law-based method or empirical rules) are applied for emission estimation. In the case study, the ship emissions in the waters of the Port of Dalian are calculated.

This paper offers two techniques for analyzing areas of high parking demand and roadway segments of high micromobility vehicle demand. The proposed processes support efforts to assign free-floating parking and reduce vehicle clutter across cities, and assist transportation planners in identifying locations for road infrastructure improvement and ordinance enforcement. An unsupervised learning approach using vendor launching site analysis is used to appropriately locate dockless vehicle parking zones. Furthermore, this paper compares three methods for identifying high-demand corridors. Two shortest path models are generated to predict trip paths for trip data without trajectories, considering rider route preferences and infrastructure types. A Simplified Matching Heuristic (SMH) that uses trip data with trajectories, is developed herein to match trip trajectory data to the network street links. These analytical processes are applied in a case study of Dallas, TX. Results show that methods using shortest path models may poorly predict the actual path taken by e-scooter users.

The results show that even with a fast introduction of plug-in electric vehicles, many fossil cars remain, which has important distributional consequences. The fuel tax and the bonus-malus scenarios impose further burdens compared to the reference scenario. The fraction of each population group incurring substantial welfare losses is higher the lower the income. In 2030, the highest-income group can avoid some adaptation costs by their car choice. In all scenarios rural areas bear the largest burden, smaller urban areas the second largest burden, and the largest urban areas the smallest burden.

Navigating institutional complexity for the adaptation of urban transport infrastructure,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103073,101,2021-12-01,2021,12,"The adaptation of transport systems to climate change is crucial for maintaining city functions in the future. Due to the complexity of this process, urban transport planners may not always be aware of all challenges they must face, leading to maladaptation or lack of adaptation of the transport systems of their cities. Recognising this complexity, this paper identifies barriers and opportunities for effective adaptation planning via a socio-technical perspective. An existing analytical framework, previously used in some cities of Latin America and Germany, is adopted and applied to a case study of Bogotá, Colombia. Interviews conducted with local professionals and a review of policy documents and technical reports provided insight into city governance processes and the extent to which climate change adaptation shapes transport sector decisions. The study reveals that incomplete or unusable information about climate change and its effects, reduced availability of economic and human resources, and the lack of adequate incentives are limiting adaptation within the transport planning processes of the city. It also demonstrates the critical influence of the institutional structure in determining which infrastructure options are considered feasible and preferable. The study elucidates what levers are available to transport planners and why some solutions are just not considered. There is potential for this study to be replicated in other parts of the world to help support the development of effective systemic intervention to support adaptation.",1361-9209,Not found

The contestation involves actor interests relating to the preservation of parking regimes, to the sensitivity of strengthening of climate-friendly transport’s competitiveness at the expense of car driving, and the difficulty of handling season-based variations in rural-centre management. The potential of rural policy packages to handle measures, actors and needs of different traveller groups in integration is crucial. We also argue that climate-friendly transport should not be based on a one-dimensional strategy of rural-centre densification but also consider how the built environment gives access for different transport modes.",1361-9209,Not found

However, fleet operator perspectives have thus far received limited attention, leaving a key knowledge gap. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring HDV fleet operator decisions about alternative fuel adoption using both existing literature and new empirical data. To this end, we first develop an initial theoretical framework of AFV fleet adoption behavior in organizations based upon existing theories and literature. We then empirically improve the framework by investigating 20 organizations in California via in-depth qualitative interviews and project reports. A total of 29 adoption and 42 non-adoption cases were probed across various alternative fuel technologies, including natural gas, propane, electricity, hydrogen, biodiesel, and renewable diesel options. Content analysis of the qualitative data yielded 38 motivators or barriers related to AFV adoption, encompassing perceived technological characteristics, organization characteristics, and external environmental influences.

Techno-economic comparison of electrification for heavy-duty trucks in China by 2040,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103152,102,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Electrification of heavy-duty trucks (HDTs) is critical of achieving sustainability and carbon neutrality in road freight. Based on the total cost of ownership and the life-cycle emissions, the study compared the traditional diesel internal combustion engine vehicle technologies with potential electrification options for HDTs in China, including battery electric vehicle, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, and battery electric catenary vehicle. Scenario and sensitivity analysis were explored the life-cycle effects of these electrification options in China from 2020 to 2040. It is found that green electricity and green hydrogen are the most important factors influencing the life-cycle emissions of CO2, NOX, and PM2.5 for different HDTs’ electrification options. The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle of HDTs has shown good performance in terms of total cost and carbon emissions, mainly due to the reduced battery capacity and the current grid mix in China.",1361-9209,Not found

For example, a two-adults one-child family with an annual income of $82,600 (2019 U.S. national median income for three-people family) is eligible for only 70% of $7,500 federal ITC. Credits are even less available for families with lower income or more children. Based on a demographic case study in Georgia, 62.1% of Atlanta households are not eligible for full federal ITC. Further complicating any policy benefits assessments is that vehicles from lower-income households (less eligible for ITCs) produce higher emissions, which would yield criteria pollutant emission reduction benefits if replaced with PEVs. The study provided a reference for policy-makers to identify potential equity issues concealed in PEV tax credit programs.",1361-9209,Not found
Indirect CO<inf>2</inf> emissions caused by the fuel demand switch in international shipping,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103164,102,2022-01-01,2022,1,"In 2020 the fuel sulphur limit in international shipping was reduced from 3.5 to 0.5 wt%. Three adaptive measures dominate: (i) increased exhaust gas cleaning in the maritime industry enabling continued use of high-sulphur fuel oil, (ii) increased refining output ratio of low-sulphur fuels, and iii) increased use of blended fuels. As (i) and (ii) are insufficient to comply with the new demand, refiners will resort to (iii), which requires increased crude oil throughput. Extracted crude oil will typically oxidize completely over longer time periods, so increased crude oil throughput is synonymous with increased CO2 emissions of up to 323 Mton in 2020, corresponding to ∼1% of the total global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. Transferring demand from low-value to high-value oil products cause indirect CO2 emissions, and vice versa.

Effect of waste materials on acoustical properties of semi-dense asphalt mixtures,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103154,102,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Among the urban societal burdens rolling noise generation from tire pavement interaction and urban waste stand apart. Many urban waste materials can be used in pavements with comparable mechanical performance. Noise-related pavement characteristics such as porosity, sound absorption and surface texture, were measured for semi-dense low noise pavement mixtures using urban waste materials namely: recycled concrete aggregates, crumb rubber, polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene. The results show that the use of these materials is a viable sustainable option for low noise pavements, however that may affect the noise reduction properties. With values around 0.2 at 1000 Hz, the sound absorption of all the mixtures is relatively low and the use of mean profile depth (MPD) alone is not enough to characterize the noise reduction properties. Surface texture was altered in different degrees depending on the waste material used. The results presented can aid in policy pertaining to noise abatement and waste reduction.",1361-9209,Not found

Based on the results of nested logit modeling, we found that spouses’ travel mode choice is less related to residential BE factors and instead significantly associated with workplace accessibility. Moreover, we also found less evidence of RSS, which is related to individuals’ residential preferences and travel environment in small cities. These findings suggest that the impact of BE on travel behavior and RSS is context specific, and that policies aimed at reducing traffic volume should differentiate between small and large Chinese cities.",1361-9209,Not found
Optimal ship lifetime fuel and power system selection,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103145,102,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Alternative fuels and fuel-flexible ships are often seen as promising solutions for achieving significant greenhouse gas reductions in shipping.

Within this setting, the question whether bio-fuels will be available to shipping has significant effect on the lifetime costs. For the given scenario and case study ship, our model identifies LNG as a robust power system choice today for a broad range of GHG reduction ambitions.

Understanding mode choice, in particular, is quintessential for incorporating micro-mobility into transport simulations in order to enable effective transport planning. We contribute by collecting a large dataset with matching GPS tracks, booking data and survey data for more than 500 travellers, and by estimating a first choice model between eight transport modes, including shared e-scooters, shared e-bikes, personal e-scooters and personal e-bikes. We find that trip distance, precipitation and access distance are fundamental to micro-mobility mode choice. Substitution patterns reveal that personal e-scooters and e-bikes emit less CO2 than the transport modes they replace, while shared e-scooters and e-bikes emit more CO2 than the transport modes they replace. Our results enable researchers and planners to test the effectiveness of policy interventions through transport simulations.

It was due to the notable presence of one outdated vehicle technology, which raises the overall CO, HC, and NO emissions by 16%, 12%, and 29%, respectively, in Mexico City. It was also due to the lack of a mandatory I/M program in Monterrey, where 19.3%, 23.9%, and 36.7% of the vehicles do not comply with the regulation for CO, NO, and HC emissions, respectively.

Considering electric cars as well as electric passenger drones, often referred to as UAM (urban air mobility), we use an urban spatial computable general equilibrium model to assess the welfare and environmental impacts of a transition to electric mobility. A numerical simulation of the model shows that a transition from gasoline to electric cars yields major emission reductions, while leading to welfare losses due to tax-induced market distortions. Introducing UAM into a gasoline-car city leads to marginal overall welfare gains. Introducing UAM into a city with electric cars results in welfare losses. While introducing UAM as an alternative to gasoline cars decreases CO2 emissions, the introduction of UAM as alternative to electric cars leads to increasing emissions.",1361-9209,Not found

The present study aims to evaluate how the changes in structural characteristics during road twinning affect roadkill rates of dwarf hairy porcupines (Coendou spinosus) in the southeast portion of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a major worldbiodiversity hotspot. The dataset for this study comes from monthly monitoring campaigns, carried out between 2013 and 2018, in the BR-101/RJ Norte (km 84–124), a major highway located in Rio de Janeiro state. The influences of structural modifications by road twinning (number of lanes, presence of road barrier, traffic, presence of construction operations, number of native vegetation on both margins of the road, sampling period) in the species roadkill rates were evaluated by means of generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs)selected based on an information theoretical approach. The average roadkill rate was 0.015 porcupine individuals/km/day of sampling and presented a trend of increase during the expansion works and decrease after the conclusion of road twinning and lane widening. Model averaging showed that presence of Jersey barriers, number of lanes, construction works for twinning, and traffic were the most influential variables for roadkill rate. An emergency measure to minimize the impact of Jersey barriers could be the implementation of escape mechanisms alongside Jersey blocks that could enable animals to cross the divider. We also propose other mitigation measures, such as the installation protective fences and safe passages, and draw insights into the behavioural responses of porcupines to roads and traffic.",1361-9209,Not found

Consequently, a systematic literature review was performed with an exclusive focus on airline SR to synthesise its associated scholarly research and distinguish the common concerns and gaps that have emerged from it. The analysed publications indicate that the industry has lacked a unified policy and common understanding of how to define and measure sustainability, which has led to inconsistent SR practices.

However, their incorporation in urban road networks is complex, since legal, social, and technical considerations often arise with respect to their usage. As official regulatory frameworks are often lacking, micromobility operators typically devise ad hoc geofences to create virtual geographic boundaries, restricting parking or access for users. In this context, this paper proposes a methodological tool for assisting decision-making in regulating e-scooter usage in urban areas. A service network design model is introduced for that purpose, aiming to maximize the extent of geofences in an urban area for the sake of maximizing road safety, while considering travel time impacts for users.

The models are estimated on an original panel data set composed of worldwide bilateral trade of manufactured goods, several characteristics of container vessels and maritime routes, and indicators of logistics performance. We show that investing in logistics improvementscangenerate trade growth, and reduce sulphur emissions per unit of goodstransported by promoting the utilization of larger and more fuel-efficient vessels.

Findings indicate that positive emotion is more sensitive to trip duration than negative emotions. Among trip-level factors, the sensitivity of emotional well-being during a trip is relatively weak when traveling by bike, bus, and rail; conducting discretionary trip purposes; traveling with spouse, family, children, and friends; conducting secondary activities while traveling; and being satisfied with the travel environment.

Using the 2019 data from Zhongshan, a medium-sized city in China, we employed gradient boosting decision trees to estimate the nonlinear and interaction effects of the built environment and motorcycles/E-bikes on car ownership. We found that wealth plays a crucial role in households’ car ownership decisions. Most built environment variables have threshold associations with car ownership, but the size of the associations is limited. The findings suggest that polycentricity and densification around centers help mitigate the growth of cars. More importantly, motorcycles and E-bikes, particularly owning a second one, attenuate the positive effects of income and/or distance to city center on car ownership.

The simulation results showed that precipitation conditions might lead to a variation in fuel consumption by 15–25 percent. Besides, the same-capacity trucks employed in the clay mine were detected to consume 40 percent more fuel in loaded travel than the limestone mine trucks due to the higher frequency of uphill loaded travels.

These measures include cumulative precipitation and the maximum wind speed, as well as their joint effect. We found that the derived vulnerability model of the joint effect of precipitation and wind speed outperforms models constructed with single TC intensity measures. The derived functions show a good fit to the observed data and can provide an accurate estimate of road damage from TCs, as validated by historical damage records. Based on the derived vulnerability curves, we further assessed the risk of road assets in Hainan Province to TCs.

Field and laboratory assessment indicated the presence of several layers of paint and glass beads, confirming that the road markings were renewed before abrasion could occur. A methodology to employ luminance histograms to estimate loss of road markings was developed and used to approximate the emissions at selected exemplary locations. The estimates indicated that road marking loss at the most used areas of pedestrian crossings was below 6%, which is much less than previously reported. Thus, the emissions of microplastics of any dimension from this source were calculated to be between 0.1 and 4.3 g/person/year (except in Nordic countries, where 56.3 g/person/year could be reached). Consequently, road markings do not appear to be as significant source of microplastic pollution as was reported before, except for specific local considerations.",1361-9209,Not found
Comparative assessment of zero emission electric and hydrogen buses in Australia,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103130,102,2022-01-01,2022,1,"The pace of direct electrification vs indirect electrification for public transit bus fleets is accelerating internationally. Clear targets have been established by transport policymakers to achieve a zero-emission bus target as early as 2030 in some jurisdictions. Two prominent choices are battery-driven electric buses and fuel-cell electric buses. We draw on evidence on these current and future developments to provide an assessment of the two types of technology on emission reduction, capital, maintenance and energy costs, and other aspects. We apply a decision support system to compare a number of scenarios for different electrification plans of bus fleets using Australian data. Comparing scenarios such as slow versus fast take up and different mixtures of energy technologies in future zero emission fleets provides evidence on the reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and costs in converting a diesel bus fleet to a fully green, at tailpipe, fleet.",1361-9209,Not found
Energy efficiency in ship operations - Exploring voyage decisions and decision-makers,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103120,102,2022-01-01,2022,1,"To mitigate climate change due to international shipping, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires shipowners and ship technical managers to improve the energy efficiency of ships’ operations. This paper studies how voyage planning and execution decisions affect energy efficiency and distinguishes between the commercial and nautical components of energy efficiency. Commercial decisions for voyage planning depend on dynamic market conditions and matter more for energy efficiency than nautical decisions do for voyage execution. The paper identifies the people involved in decision-making processes and advances the energy-efficiency literature by revealing the highly networked nature of agency for energy efficiency. The IMO’s current energy efficiency regulations fail to distinguish between the commercial and nautical aspects of energy efficiency, which limits the ability to mitigate climate change through regulatory measures. Policymakers should expand their regulatory focus beyond shipowners and technical managers to cargo owners to improve energy efficiency and reduce maritime transport emissions.",1361-9209,Not found
Benefits of electrifying app-taxi fleet – A simulation on trip data from New Delhi,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103113,102,2022-01-01,2022,1,"Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) appear integral to improving urban air quality, especially in less-wealthier countries whose cities rank amongst the most polluted and fastest growing. But despite steep declines in battery prices and generous subsidies, BEV adoption in such countries is weak. Here, the tremendous growth of app-taxi and retail delivery vehicles presents a massive new opportunity. Since they register several-fold greater utilization relative to the average pure private-use vehicle, electrifying such vehicles could deliver rapid financial payback and much greater economic and pollution benefits. A general framework for spatially-detailed estimation of charging infrastructure, and the economic and environmental benefits of commercial fleet electrification was developed and applied to a dataset comprising ∼ 730,000 app-taxi trips spanning ∼ 15 million kilometers (km) in Delhi, India, which shows: i) ∼ 23000 BEVs with 200 km range and a network of 3000 50 kilo-Watt chargers could satisfy 100% of Delhi’s daily app-taxi demand, and relative to a compressed natural gas (diesel) fleet eliminate 180 (700) and 0.14 (70) metric tonnes of vehicle tail-pipe NOX and particulate matter emissions respectively annually and reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by 15% (27%) per km. Cost savings are sensitive to retail BEV price and government subsidies, which are not indicative of future prices given the infancy of BEV industry. Under current prices and subsidies in India, BEVs reduce levelized cost per km 21% and 37% relative to CNG and Diesel vehicles respectively. Electrification of taxi fleets increases aggregate electricity consumption 2% with insignificant increase during daily peak demand hours. Therefore, ambitious zero emissions vehicle targets for commercial light duty vehicle fleets appear environmentally, economically and socially sound.",1361-9209,Not found
Fair mobility budgets: A concept for achieving climate neutrality and transport equity,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103165,103,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Transport justice has two essential dimensions: (1) compensating for inequalities in access to mobility, and (2) mitigating the disproportionately burdensome negative consequences of transport. In light of the urgently needed action regarding climate change especially in the transport sector, measures reducing carbon emissions to mitigate the impact are inevitable. However, policy measures for reaching climate targets should avoid increasing unequal mobility chances. Therefore, there is a need for concepts striving to mitigate both climate impacts and transport injustice. The paper addresses the potential of introducing individual mobility budgets to achieve transport-related climate goals while reducing inequalities in mobility. The concept proposed in this contribution is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative impact assessment methods including a stakeholder involvement process and transport modelling based on different data sources.

Congestion and environmental impacts of short car trip replacement with micromobility modes,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103173,103,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Transportation is a basic social need, but most trips are done by private vehicles, which is not environmentally sustainable with growing urban populations. Micromobility (e.g., shared bikes) represents a significant opportunity to replace short private vehicles trips (0–3 miles) and reduce transportation sector emissions. This paper uses Seattle as a case study and estimates that up to 18% of short car trips could be replaced by micromobility. A static traffic assignment model is developed to simulate and compare the results of peak hour traffic under a base case scenario (2014 traffic conditions) to scenarios where a portion of short car trips are substituted by micromobility. Results indicate that micromobility could reduce congestion on heavily congested corridors and wide-scale bike lane deployment can maximize congestion benefits, but the impacts to energy use and emissions are disproportionately low and other measures (e.g., vehicle electrification) are needed to meet climate change emissions targets.",1361-9209,Not found

Public buses and carpooled shared mobility increase system capacity, resulting in lower vehicle ownership, energy demand and CO2 emissions, as well as savings per ton of CO2 abated (from $3 to $4186). Biofuels reduce CO2 emissions at no increased system cost, while carbon pricing is the most effective policy to reduce CO2 emissions, but it is costlier than the alternatives and results in greater private vehicle use (up to 260%) if the expansion of zero-carbon public transportation remains limited due to technology adoption.

Therefore, attaining an extensive validated EC prediction model is essential to surmount the challenges in collecting real-world data. In this respect, this study develops and assesses an open-source low-resolution data-driven framework to estimate BEB's EC in transit operation, using vehicular, operational, topological, and external parameters. Moreover, a three-step validation process is used to assess the proposed framework's performance. The results show that the prediction model provides a reasonable error margin (20%).

A set of customized general and type-specific noise prediction models were developed and compared. The models were based on the calculation of road traffic noise (CORTN) method. The results indicated that intersection type-specific models fit the measured data for the different intersection types better than general models for the studied conditions.

However, the potential negative health burden of active travel due to air pollution exposure is neglected. Consequently, this study proposes a low-exposure route-planning method based on pollutant concentration, trip purpose, and travelers’ demographic characteristics. Taxi-based mobile pollutant monitoring data in Cangzhou city, China, were applied to provide a high-resolution concentration map. We found that exposure varied throughout the day and seasons due to traffic, coal usage, and meteorology. Results show that exercising travelers may avoid 16.8% of exposure experienced by commuting travelers when choosing a route with low exposure but long detours. Because of the lower travel speed, even when taking a low-exposure route, middle-aged and elderly may suffer 22.9% and 10.7% higher exposure, respectively, than younger travelers. These might lead to health inequity related to transportation investment or policies.",1361-9209,Not found
Sharing behavior in ride-hailing trips: A machine learning inference approach,10.1016/j.trd.2021.103166,103,2022-02-01,2022,2,"Ride sharing or pooling is important to mitigate negative externalities of ride-hailing such as increased congestion and environmental impacts. However, there lacks empirical evidence on what affect trip-level sharing behavior in ride-hailing. Using a novel dataset from all ride-hailing trips in Chicago in 2019, we show that the willingness of riders to request a shared ride has monotonically decreased from 27.0% to 12.8% throughout the year, while the trip volume and mileage have remained statistically unchanged. We find that the decline in sharing preference is due to an increased per-mile costs of shared trips and shifting shorter trips to solo. Using ensemble machine learning models, we find that the travel impedancevariables (trip cost, distance, and duration) collectively contribute to the predictive power by 95% in the propensity to share and 91% in successful matching of a trip. Spatial and temporal attributes, sociodemographic, built environment, and transit supply variables do not entail significant predictive power at the trip level in presence of these travel impedance variables.

The study combines registry data with detailed accessibility metrics and uses descriptive maps and spatial regression models to study transport poverty. The results show that less affluent neighbourhoods suffer from low accessibility and poor time competitiveness of public transport, which is partly related to the suburbanization of poverty. This suggests that the transition to low emission mobility, with restrictions on car use, may be especially burdensome in less affluent neighbourhoods.

Walks are longer on the workplace side than on the home side of the journey. Walking distances to local public transport stops increase with city size. Short trips to stops increase the likelihood of using public transport for commutes.

Rural residents living in the mountain, high plateau, and hilly areas are more likely to travel a long distance to the nearest periodic market than those living in the plain area. The proximity of the town center positively relates to access to periodic markets.

This reduction in VKT is equivalent to a savings of 1,234,164 Liters in petroleum consumption and 3308 tons in carbon emissions annually. Additionally, our simulations indicate that the contribution of ride-pooling to VKT reduction is highly sensitive to buffer time and period of day.

Proper placement of charging infrastructures and management of charging activities is the key to ensuring the environmental benefits from the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). By employing empirical travel trajectory data, this paper investigates how individual travel and dwelling patterns can affect the distribution of spatial and temporal opportunities for electric vehicle charging, as well as charging infrastructure installation across regions. We formulate an integrated optimization platform for estimating electric vehicle charging infrastructure placement in home and non-home locations simultaneously that include infrastructure costs and dynamic electricity prices with a mixed-integer linear programming. We provide two case studies in the Great Sacramento Area and San Diego, California. The results show that higher non-home charging opportunity informed by the empirical travel and dwelling patterns offers more potentials for a shared public charging system in San Diego, resulting in 14−30% lower in total system cost and 21−25% lower in emissions. This indicates that the heterogeneity in spatial and temporal travel and dwelling patterns substantially affect the design of the charging infrastructure system, and significantly change the energy, economic and environmental impacts of the system. We also observe sensible timing of charging in non-home locations that correspond to daytime hours and a secondary peak in charging at home locations during nighttime hours in both regions, emphasizing the importance of integrating grid dynamics into EV charging infrastructures planning process.

We apply a latent-class cluster analysis to indicators of changes in the use of various travel modes as a result of ridehailing adoption, with covariates of socioeconomics, demographics, a land-use attribute, and individual attitudes. We identify four distinctive latent classes of behavioral changes in response to the use of ridehailing. About half of ridehailing users in the sample (49.7%) are found to behave as Mobility augmenters, who use ridehailing rarely, in addition to other travel modes, and do not change their travel routines much as a result of the adoption of this mobility service. The second largest class includes Exogenous changers (24.5%), whose members report many changes in their use of various travel modes, but which can be largely explained by other reasons. Private car/taxi substituters (15%) frequently hail a ride, and as a result, reduce their use of private vehicles while making more trips by public transit and active modes, as the result of using ridehailing. Interestingly, Transit/active mode substituters (10.8%) often use ridehailing, likely for trips that they previously made by public transit or active modes, and consequently reduce their use of these less-polluting modes while enjoying enhanced mobility. This study reveals substantial heterogeneity in ridehailing impacts, which were masked in previous studies that focused on average impacts, and it suggests that policy responses should be customized by users’ socioeconomics and residential neighborhoods.",1361-9209,Not found

The empirical results indicate that the determinants of continuance intention are satisfaction, perceived usefulness, economic benefits, environmental awareness, and platform incentives. Female users’ satisfaction has a more important effect on continuance intention than male users’, whereas perceived usefulness has a relatively small effect. Unexpectedly, the effect of platform incentives on the continuance intention of female users is non-significant. The social experience of users without private cars has a stronger effect on satisfaction than that of users who have private cars.",1361-9209,Not found
Land-Use microsimulation model for livelihood diversification after the 2010 Merapi volcano eruptions,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103189,104,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The 2010 Merapi Volcano eruptions caused significant damage in the Sleman Regency of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Several households (HHs) were relocated to safely designated areas, but to sustain their livelihoods they have to travel back to their farmlands or change their identities as farmers. This study evaluates post-disaster mobility, aiming to clarify whether a land-use network with distributed livelihood options can complement rural labor in a recovery scenario. We collected sociodemographic and travel routine data in the affected areas. Then, the operational land use and transport microsimulation (OLUTM) model was performed to forecast a future scenario and gauge livelihood changes. Middle-aged farmers with upper median incomes and risk-taking behaviors were found to venture home businesses that contribute to rural labor. A 63% share of livelihoods diversified by farmers and 30% travel utility savings rendered a robust microsimulation system.",1361-9209,Not found
The optimal pricing for green ride services in the ride-sharing economy,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103205,104,2022-03-01,2022,3,"With the growing awareness of environmental protection, it has emerged as inevitable for ride-sharing platforms to introduce electric vehicles (EVs) and incorporate into the trend of sustainable transportation. To promote the popularization of EVs in the ride-sharing economy, the platforms need to understand uncertainties faced by EV drivers and eco-friendly consumption behaviors exhibited by consumers. With an analytical model that captures the characteristics of ride-sharing participants, this paper examines the pricing mechanism of a profit-maximizing ride-sharing platform operating two ride services, a basic ride service via general vehicles powered by fossil fuel and a green ride service via EVs. We find the optimal price of green ride service under the dynamic pricing contract and the optimal wage under the dynamic wage contract. We show that if there are more consumers than drivers for the green ride service, the optimal solution is independent of the opportunity cost of EV drivers.",1361-9209,Not found
Flexible pavement performance and life cycle assessment incorporating climate change impacts,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103203,104,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Construction, maintenance and demolition of pavements are often considered the only activities impacting the environment. This paper shows that user emissions, influenced by factors such as road roughness and climate change, are also important measurements of pavement sustainability. The objective of this paper is to complete a life cycle assessment of a typical flexible pavement based on the climate change forecast by using road deterioration and user emissions analysed with the Highway Development and Management 4 (HDM-4) package. Data from South Africa were used to prove the concept. Results showed that user emissions dominate life cycle environmental impacts, and that gradual warming and drying of the atmosphere attributed to climate change is beneficial to pavement deterioration and emissions alike. Although invariably debate about the impact of climate change has negative connotations, and the reality of many negative impacts, road authorities in South Africa are fortunate that less rainfall will be beneficial.",1361-9209,Not found
Quantifying residential self-selection effects on commuting mode choice: A natural experiment,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103197,104,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Though the impact of residential self-selection on travel behavior has been widely discussed in transport studies, few studies have examined its effect on commuting mode choice, particularly when considering the mediating effects of commuting distance and car ownership. By using survey data from 19 large cities in China and taking advantage of the largely exogenous residential locations of social housing residents, we employed a natural experiment framework that combines propensity score weighting and simultaneous equation models to investigate the effects of the built environment and residential self-selection on commuting mode choice. The results show that most direct and indirect effects through commuting distance and car ownership are significant. The total effects of the built environment and residential self-selection have the same coefficient signs for car and regular bike modes, while they have opposite coefficient signs for public transit and e-bike modes.",1361-9209,Not found
How and why we travel – Mobility demand and emissions from passenger transport,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103195,104,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Due to the need for faster reductions in transport greenhouse-gas emissions, policy makers are increasingly paying attention to the role of reducing mobility demand and shifting towards low carbon transport modes. This paper develops the novel open-source Irish Passenger Transport Emissions and Mobility (IPTEM) model and uses it to calculate passenger transport demand by trip mode, purpose, and distance over the period of 2009 – 2019. The paper quantifies energy consumption and emissions intensities, and for the first time for Ireland, passenger transport occupancy rates. The findings quantify missed targets in walking and cycling uptake rates. In 2019, travel for work purposes contributes the greatest to overall passenger transport demand (30%) followed by shopping (19%) and companion journeys (16%). Journeys under 8 km were responsible for 37% of passenger transport emissions.",1361-9209,Not found
Integrating sustainability into pavement maintenance effectiveness evaluation: A systematic review,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103187,104,2022-03-01,2022,3,"Based on the publications from two databases during 1998–2020, this paper presents a systematic literature review on pavement maintenance effectiveness evaluation to summarize the current trend and identify the research gap that must be addressed for a sustainable maintenance management. This review has analyzed and synthesized maintenance thresholds and their mechanisms, the measurement methods of effectiveness in terms of performance, cost and environmental impacts. In particular, this paper has critically examined the state-of-art maintenance effectiveness optimization strategy that has included environmental concerns and sustainable goals, in comparison with the traditional cost-effectiveness evaluation method.

The role of residential consonance and dissonance between couples in travel behavior,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103196,104,2022-03-01,2022,3,"The present study investigates the extent to which residential consonance/dissonance between couples affected travel behavior at the household level. Using data from the Netherlands, we employed principal component analysis and clustering to construct a residential consonant/dissonant couples typology. We applied gender-specific ordered logistic models to determine the effects of residential consonance/dissonance on travel mode usage. The seemingly unrelated estimation test was used to compare the regression results for male and female household members. The results showed that car use was low among non-urban dissonant men, whereas cycling and train use was high. Non-urban dissonant couples preferred walking. Dissonant men in non-urban areas were less influenced by the residential environment and were inclined to adapt their travel behavior to their partners' travel preferences. Our findings suggest that providing more attractive residential locations and sustainable transport services may enable couples to mitigate residential dissonance.",1361-9209,Not found

Modeling evacuations from these wildfires is markedly different than modeling disasters with slower or more predictable movements. There is a gap in our knowledge of human evacuation behavior under these conditions. In this paper, we develop an agent-based simulation model (ABM) of the 2018 Camp Fire evacuation in Northern California, an extreme wildfire evacuation. We use a post-disaster survey and decision tree methods to model agent movements, empirically grounding evacuee behavior. We explore individual scenarios inspired by the Camp Fire, simulating limited smartphone access, delays in awareness time, and reduced vehicle access. We then combine these to produce “worst case” critical scenarios. Our results show that longer evacuation travel times are associated with reduced smartphone use, increased delays in awareness, and reduced vehicle access. More agents are trapped with awareness delays and limited vehicles.",1361-9209,Not found
Examining behavioral responses to Mexico City's driving restriction: A mixed methods approach,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103191,104,2022-03-01,2022,3,"License-plate-based driving restrictions have a mixed track record of reducing pollution and congestion. This paper analyzes a large household travel survey, household interviews, and a focus group to examine how residents adjust their travel behavior in response to Mexico City’s Hoy No Circula. Purchasing a newer exempt vehicle is a popular approach. Two-thirds of private cars on the road are exempt. These vehicles are more likely to be driven by wealthier residents during peak hours and in the most congested, central parts of the metropolitan area. Households with a non-exempt vehicle generally only drive a few times per week. However, there is a small subset of metropolitan drivers with restricted vehicles who drive regularly. These regular drivers adopt a suite of behavioral responses, including switching modes, shuffling travel to unrestricted times, and cheating. Even under optimistic assumptions, the policy reduces driving by far less than the 20% that policymakers hope.",1361-9209,Not found

To reduce emissions, companies have started selling electric motorcycles. We quantify the use-phase emissions impact of electrifying motorcycle taxis by processing real-world trip and charging data from Kampala, then estimating charging-caused emissions with an economic dispatch model of the Ugandan power system. We then compare these emissions to tank-to-wheels estimates of conventional motorcycles over the same trips. We find that electrifying gas-powered motorcycle taxis would reduce carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and hydrocarbon emissions by 36%, 90%, 58%, and 99%, respectively, but increase sulfur oxide (SOx), particulate matter 10 μm or less (PM10), and particulate matter 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) emissions by 870%, 109%, and 97%, respectively. PM and SOx emission increases stem from generation at bagasse and heavy fuel oil (HFO) point sources far from load centers. Additionally, we find seasonality of the charging associated emissions due to dominance of hydropower in the Ugandan grid.

Residents were generally satisfied with most of mitigation measures, although a reduction in their perceived effectiveness was observed in the 2020 survey. The perception of mitigation measures explained between 2.9 and 6.5% of the variance in construction noise annoyance.

We use electricity loss and flooding scenarios to determine the critical element of NYC’s electric bus infrastructure: on-street fast chargers, not overnight depot chargers. This conclusion applies for both routes, despite differences in route length, charging pattern, and battery size. Applying existing infrastructure and cost analyses, we conclude that temporary flood barriers around on-street chargers used with diesel generators and solar panels are strong resiliency methods. Additionally, considering flood projections in charger site choices can avoid unexpected costs. These findings are a departure from previous disaster planning focused on centralized bus facilities.

A spatio-temporal approach to electric vehicle uptake: Evidence from New Zealand,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103256,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Electrification of transportation is an important option to reduce fossil fuels consumption and carbon emissions. However, electric vehicles (EVs) comprise less than 1.2% of New Zealand’s light vehicle fleet, and there are significant hurdles to limit EV uptake. This study uses spatial negative binomial regression models to estimate spatio-temporal factors that influence consumers’ purchase decisions. Two hypotheses are tested: (1) if charging infrastructure has a “neighbourhood effect” on EV uptake; (2) if EVs adoption by technology enthusiasts during the early-adopter phase affects subsequent adoption once the technology becomes widely spread. Results show that charging infrastructure in neighbouring areas and early adoption positively affect subsequent technology adoption. Robustness analysis suggests that the distance spatial weights matrices outperformed other types of alternatives in this study may represent the boundaries of a convenience threshold that drivers perceive when they get their EVs. Thus, policy initiatives aiming to increase the electrification of transport should consider the likelihood of early adoption and the spatial proximity of charging infrastructure.",1361-9209,Not found

Households with a member who has special medical needs and those evacuating with a greater number of vehicles were more likely to stay in the eastern portion of their county. Greater perceived certainty about the hurricane impact location decreased households’ probability of evacuating to the south. For the accommodation model, married evacuees and those who received official evacuation notices had increased likelihood of staying in hotels/motels, while those who evacuated a day before landfall were less likely to do so.

Traffic congestion is proved to be reduced compared to the without V2G case when commuters choosing to discharge arrive at the bottleneck earlier than those choosing not to discharge. We also derive the sufficient condition of the “win–win–win” situation for EV drivers, power and transport systems and develop a decision tree for the power system to set the discharge reward optimally.",1361-9209,Not found
Comparative assessment of measured and modelled aircraft noise around Amsterdam Airport Schiphol,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103216,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"The impressive growth of the aviation industry and the number of flights entail several environmental repercussions, such as increased aircraft noise emissions. With the worrying number of complaints from the communities around airports comes also the distrust in numerical models used for aircraft noise prediction. In this study, we compare the ‘Dutch aircraft noise model’ predictions to measured values from the NOise MOnitoring System (NOMOS) around Amsterdam Airport Schiphol between 2012 and 2018. While the model underestimates aircraft noise in 2012, the model prediction improved throughout the years. We observe a decreasing trend of measured aircraft-related L d e n values of 0.6dB(A)/year (a total of 3.6dB(A) over the investigation period), although the total number of flight movements increased during the observation time. We propose that a change in fleet mix, as well as the implementation of Noise Abatement Procedures at Schiphol Airport, fuelled this trend.",1361-9209,Not found
Gendered perceptions of cycling safety and on-street bicycle infrastructure: Bridging the gap,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103237,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Unsafe cycling environments are often hypothesized as a key factor behind a gender gap in bicycling. We examine gendered safety perceptions using data from street intercept surveys across 10 urban and suburban study areas in the Toronto region, Canada, five with on-street bicycle infrastructure, and five without. Results reinforce that cyclists who identify as women are more concerned about safety overall compared to those who identify as men. However, we found no gendered difference in fear of collision and injury. Instead, women reported more concerns related to verbal abuse/bullying, and with how drivers interact with cyclists. Significant gendered difference in the likelihood of having higher concerns of being bullied or verbally abused existed regardless of the presence of bicycle infrastructure. Drawing on feminist theories of performativity and embodiment, we conclude that safety perceptions are likely a product of social norms, expectations, and traditions related to a cyclists’ gender expression.",1361-9209,Not found
Environmental impact assessment of bike-sharing considering the modal shift from public transit,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103238,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Bike sharing has the potential to benefit the environment with less energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Most previous studies on this topic assumed that bikeshare trips mainly substitute cars. However, bikeshare also replaces ecologically friendly transportation modes like public transit (PT). Therefore, it is vital to examine bikeshare's modal shift from PT to fully assess its environmental impacts. This paper examines the bikeshare and PT relationships in Chengdu,and environmental effects of bike sharing under two cases based on this relationship. The first case only considers the substitution of bikeshare for car and walking, and 19,964.31 L of fuel and 4125.13 kg of CO2 can be saved; while the second case also considers its substitution for buses and subways, and 13,198.68 L of fuel and 2564.31 kg of CO2 can be saved. Results indicate that the environmental benefits of bike sharing may be overestimated if not considering its substitution for PT.",1361-9209,Not found
Energy and greenhouse gas implications of shared automated electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103233,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Automated vehicles can facilitate vehicle sharing within and between households, thus decreasing ownership rates, albeit increasing miles travelled. While electrification can achieve deep reductions in transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions, shared automated electric vehicles will have different charging needs considering their higher mileage. In this study, travel survey data collected in Toronto is used to optimize the charging needs of shared automated electric vehicles, with the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation by choosing charging times that are associated with lower marginal emission factors. Optimized charging schedules reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% relative to vehicles charging once they return home. Life cycle assessment of multiple sharing scenarios indicates that higher levels of sharing increase emissions. Indeed, empty mileage associated with vehicle relocation and higher deterioration lead to a higher fleet turnover. With vehicle sharing, there is a risk of increasing mileage and vehicle production emissions.",1361-9209,Not found
Does the development of China's high-speed rail improve the total-factor carbon productivity of cities?,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103230,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"China's high-speed rail (HSR) has developed expeditiously since the beginning of the 21st century, exerting significant influences on many aspects, such as economic development and residents' travel mode. Improving carbon productivity is one of the necessary measures to realize China's carbon neutrality goal, considering economic growth. However, previous researches have not dealt with the exact impact of HSR opening on carbon emission performance. This study seeks to fill this gap. Through the difference-in-differences (DID) model, we discover that the opening of HSR significantly improves the city's total-factor carbon productivity in China. In addition, the influencing mechanism and heterogeneity of the impact are discussed, and the polarization effect is also analyzed. Overall, this study strengthens the idea that HSR construction has positive environmental externalities. The insights gained from this study may be of assistance to accurately formulate policies related to HSR planning and construction in the future.",1361-9209,Not found
Wishful thinking? Addressing the long-term implications of COVID-19 for transport in Nigeria,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103206,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"With their inherent economic and infrastructure challenges, developing countries must assess commuters’ travel behaviour and establish whether consumers’ desire for sustainable transportation is feasible or merely wishful thinking. Using a qualitative research design, these issues were explored based on semi-structured interviews conducted with 72 participants across the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Findings suggest that the desires and dreams of the commuters are great, and they want to reduce their journeys, work from home, and do online shopping. However, when they consider the inherent challenges, they can only hope for a better future. COVID-19 has impacted the ownership or use of motorised and non-motorised transport, but this is also influenced by affordability, convenience, and awareness.

Dynamic grid-receptor method for regional-level near-road air quality analysis,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103232,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Although various modeling tools have been developed to predict potential public exposure to harmful transportation emissions at regional scales, computational efficiency remains a critical concern in the design of modeling tools. Thus, most regional applications of microscale dispersion models for traffic-induced pollutants have predicted spatial pollutant concentration profiles with reduced receptor resolution (e.g., 200 m by 200 m resolution), to reduce computing resources and time. However, such simplified model settings were weak in identifying great variations in near-road pollutant concentration profiles. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a strategic receptor placement method, called dynamic-receptor-grid model (DGRM), that identifies the optimal receptor positions across a region, while preserving the high-resolution pollutant concentration profiles predicted by dense receptor placement. DGRM places receptor positions considering each link’s geometry and emissions characteristics. The modeling results suggest that the optimal receptor placement based on DGRM readily approximates the high-resolution PM2.5 concentration profiles.",1361-9209,Not found
Urban structure and sustainable modes’ competitiveness in small and medium-sized Norwegian cities,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103225,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"This paper contributes novel empirical and theoretical knowledge on how built environment characteristics affect travel behaviour in small and medium-sized cities and how this differs from larger cities. The competitiveness of sustainable modes versus the private car tends to increase and commuting distances tend to decrease with proximity of dwellings and workplaces to the city centre, following similar patterns as in larger cities, although the tendencies are weaker. Car-usage tend to decrease with higher city-level densities. Relatively dense mixed-use zones outside the inner-city generate higher car shares and longer commutes compared with inner cities and in some cases also outer parts of cities. It is concluded that small and medium-sized cities aiming at improving the competitiveness of sustainable modes versus the private car can follow the same advice as larger cities–steering new urban development to central parts of cities and avoiding new development in the outer areas.",1361-9209,Not found
Population density and obesity in rural China: Mediation effects of car ownership,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103228,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Low-density built environments contribute to obesity by reducing physical activity. Nevertheless, few studies have explored the relationship between population density and obesity in rural areas and the mediation effect of car ownership. Using 2004–2015 data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we examine the association between population density and weight status in Chinese rural areas and identify whether car ownership mediates the association using fixed-effect models and a causal step approach. The results show that population density is positively associated with weight status in rural areas. A higher population density contributes to weight gain through increasing car ownership. However, the mediation effects of car ownership are statistically significant only for young adults. These findings highlight the rural–urban difference in the association between population density and weight status. Hence, policymakers should pay more attention to local contexts when they intervene in the built environment for obesity prevention.",1361-9209,Not found
How to realize low-carbon travel in rural areas? Evidence from China,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103224,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"Low-carbon travel for rural residents in China is of great significance for reducing CO2 emissions and achieving the “dual carbon goals”. This paper uses system dynamics modeling and case analysis to explore the realization path of low-carbon travel in rural China, establishes a complex system dynamics model of low-carbon rural travel in China. By running multi-scenario simulations, the characteristics of rural residents‘ travel and the trend of CO2 emissions in China are found. Through the case study, it is found that the built environment, low-carbon travel policy, rural residents‘ travel preference and travel cost are the important factors affecting rural low-carbon travel. New energy policy can effectively reduce rural travel CO2 emissions. However, an excessively large increase in rural low-carbon public transport would reduce marginal benefits.

Right-wing populism and climate policies: Explaining opposition to road tolls in Norway,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103222,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"In 2019, the road toll uproar in Norway contributed to a governmental crisis and road tolls became the most debated issue in the media. Using survey data of around 2,000 respondents, we explore what characterizes opponents of road tolls. Key findings are that attitudes relating to climate change, the environment, and right-wing populism are strongly related to opposition to road tolls. We propose that these attitudes and opposition to toll roads are components of an anti-elitist identity struggle linked to recent literature suggesting that right-wing populists display particular resistance to climate-related policies. Lack of alternative transport modes is not a strong predictor, while owning a car does predict increased opposition. A policy-relevant question for future research is how to facilitate more inclusive climate policies debates, bringing in those who feel left out, for the instruments to be both efficient and legitimate.",1361-9209,Not found
Traffic impacts on energy consumption of electric and conventional vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103231,105,2022-04-01,2022,4,"This study presents the energy consumption of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Internal Combustion Engine (ICEVs: Petrol, Diesel) over more than 100 driving cycles. This aims at identifying the relative impact of a range of traffic conditions on the energy consumption of powertrains. Minimum consumption of BEVs appears at low-speed urban traffic, because of regenerative braking and high part-load powertrain efficiency. The optimum consumption of ICEVs was found at higher speeds, typical of rural-suburban environments. Traffic speed restriction in urban networks can further improve BEVs consumption, while speed increase would improve ICEVs. Congestion mitigation delivers 13%, 25%, 17% gains on average for BEV, Petrol and Diesel respectively. Gains are larger for ICEVs at lower speeds (25 km/h) and less so for BEVs in higher speeds (45 km/h).

Results showed that BEVs and e-bikes reduce CO2, and this reduction can increase with change in electricity mix and battery recycling. Advantages of e-bikes are not proportional to the weight of the vehicle.

Transforming parking lots into EV-enabled parking lots that provide parking and charging services is a solution to address the need for charging stations. Two challenges arise in this context: (1) how many parking spots should receive EV chargers and (2) how to appropriately define the pricing scheme for the charging service. We tackle these challenges by proposing a novel framework based on discrete-event simulations and queueing theory. Our framework can estimate the ideal number of EV chargers and the charging price. These estimates can be used to determine the profitability and payback period for transforming traditional parking lots into EV-enabled parking lots. We illustrate the use of our framework in a real-world setting involving the city of Melbourne, Australia.

We find that customers choose vehicle-to-grid over electric carsharing in 56.1% and over conventional carsharing in 74.2% of the choices. By estimating a multinomial, a mixed-logit, and a willingness-to-pay-space model, we find that costs show the highest relative importance for customers’ utilities despite the early adopter sample.

Walking distances to stops increased in some areas and services were reduced on less used routes. The interventions were followed by patronage growth of 3.3–17.6% per year over the evaluation period, contrasting the pre-change situation of lower growth or decline. Stronger focus on increasing public transport competitiveness versus cars, enhanced knowledge among planners and organisational changes leaving more power to the professionals stood out as important factors explaining why these interventions had been implemented.

Specifically, route redundancy is assessed with two complementary dimensions: the diversity and dispersion of alternative routes. The former represents the number of alternative routes without disruptions, and the latter reflects the robustness of this number during disruptions. Three typical mega-city regions in China, namely the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and the Yangtze River Delta—are examined as case studies. Results indicate that travelers in first-tier cities (i.e., national economic or political centers) may have inadequate route redundancy. Route diversity increases when more topological cycles are traversed by numerous alternative routes. Additionally, alternative routes of the peripheral cities in mega-city regions are less dispersed, which cause their lack of redundancy and should be improved.",1361-9209,Not found

The results showed that the deformation characteristics of stone mastic asphalt have significant effects on the tire-pavement noise reduction in intermediate-frequency and high-frequency bands. Larger connected air voids of porous asphalt concrete could obtain better ability of noise reduction, especially in the low-frequency band. Both the water submerged and voids-clogging have slight effects on the noise reduction of stone mastic asphalt, while having greater influences on porous asphalt concrete. Water submerged mainly increases the high-frequency band noise, and voids-clogging affects the noise at low-frequency and high-frequency bands.

Results indicate substantial uncertainty in the suitability of different ZEV drivetrains, potential for multiple options to capture the majority of market share, and potential for the prioritized infrastructure to strongly influence adoption.",1361-9209,Not found
The underestimated role of the transportation network: Improving disaster &amp; community resilience,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103218,106,2022-05-01,2022,5,"Improving community resilience relies on our ability to evaluate and understand the direct and indirect role of the transportation network. This requires losing our fixation with network functionality in favour of an approach that evaluates whether the network is truly serving the community’s needs. In this paper, we present such an approach. With the understanding that sufficient and equitable access to amenities is key to community resilience, we leverage open-source data and routing algorithms to simulate road and service closures under various hazard scenarios. Among our methodological contributions is the ability to efficiently modify entire transportation networks to reflect hazard damage and identify isolated communities. This makes integrating hazard simulation with access and equity evaluations practicable on a large scale. We illustrate this approach in three cities. Ultimately, a broader view of the transportation network’s role will better support communities prepare for and respond equitably when a disaster occurs.",1361-9209,Not found
Electric vehicle demand estimation and charging station allocation using urban informatics,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103264,106,2022-05-01,2022,5,"This paper performs a novel data-driven approach to optimize electric vehicle (EV)public charging.

A modified geographical PageRank (MGPR) model is developed to estimate EV charging demand, built upon trip origin–destination (OD)and social dimension features, and validated against real-world charging data.The results are fed into the capacitated maximal coverage location problem (CMCLP) model to optimize the spatial layout of public charging stations by maximizing their utilization. It is shown that MGPR can effectively quantify the EV charging demand with satisfactory accuracy. Optimized EV charging stations based on the CMCLP model can remedy the spatial mismatch between the EV demand and the existing charging station allocations. The developed methodological framework is highly generalizable and can be extended to other regions for EV charging demand estimation and optimal charging infrastructure siting.",1361-9209,Not found

Real-world road grades from design drawings and 261,814 second-by-second vehicle operating data from 680 light-duty vehicles were collected to examine the proposed method’s performance. Sensitivity tests for vehicle types and sample sizes were conducted. Results show that (1) the proposed method acquired road grade with an accuracy of 0.12% mean absolute error (MAE), (2) in positive vehicle specific power (VSP) bins, a 1% road grade caused an average 16% FCR change, and (3) larger-scale fuel consumption data contributed to reducing estimation error which converged from 0.25% to 0.12% as the segment passes increased from 50 to 400.",1361-9209,Not found

Adaptive cruise control, a critical longitudinal control system of commercial automated vehicles (AVs), may have significant impacts on fuel consumption. To investigate the impacts, this paper collected high-resolution trajectory data of commercial AVs with different operating scenarios, speed ranges, and headway settings on the highway system. The AVs’ fuel consumption was calculated by several state-of-the-art or classical vehicle fuel consumption models. From empirical analyses, we found that as the AV headway setting increases, the corresponding fuel consumption decreases. Also, we found that as the speed of AV traffic increases, the impacts of AV headway settings on fuel consumption decrease. Moreover, we compared the fuel consumption of AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). We found that for the same settings, the AVs always require less fuel consumption than the HVs. Following these findings, a set of managerial insights were provided into relevant stakeholders for future AV traffic.",1361-9209,Not found

Designing electric vehicle incentives to meet emission reduction targets,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103320,107,2022-06-01,2022,6,Electric vehicles are expected to reduce transportation emissions. We design and allocate rebates and charging infrastructure investments to induce electric vehicle adoption and achieve emission reduction targets.

Logistic functions describe the vehicle demand driven by capital and ownership costs and network externalities. A simulated annealing algorithm is used to solve the nonlinear programming problem that is applied using data representative of the United States market. Our analysis indicates that rebates should be provided earlier than chargers due to neighborhood effects of electric vehicle adoption and the minimization of expenditure; availability of home charging influences consumers choice and the drivers electrified travel distance; rebates are more effective for modest drivers while charging stations should be prioritized for frequent drivers; network externalities should be further investigated because of their impact on electric vehicle demand.,1361-9209,Not found

In addition, the GWR model bears more weight in measuring the local link when compared to the ordinary least squares model. What’s more, the estimated coefficients of built environment characteristics vary positively or negatively in diverse TAZs.

Level 2 automation has the potential to reduce driver fatigue and make driving less stressful which could mean drivers choose to travel more. We use questionnaire survey data to investigate changes to long distance travel and annual vehicle miles travelled (VMT) due to automation. Results show those who report doing more long-distance travel because of automation are younger; have a lower household income; live in urban areas; own a longer-range electric vehicle; use automation in a variety of conditions; and have pro-technology attitudes and prefer outdoor lifestyles.

This model is then used to assess the impact of a carbon tax on a ship owner’s investment decision. A low carbon tax results in ship owners deferring investments, which then slows the uptake of the technology.

This study proposes a new methodology to analyze wildfire evacuation by leveraging a large-scale GPS dataset. This methodology includes a proxy-home-location inference algorithm and an evacuation-behavior inference algorithm, to systematically identify different groups of wildfire evacuees (i.e., self-evacuee, shadow evacuee, evacuee under warning, and ordered evacuee). We applied the methodology to the 2019 Kincade Fire in Sonoma County, CA. We found that among all groups of evacuees, self-evacuees and shadow evacuees accounted for more than half of the evacuees during the Kincade Fire. The findings of this study can be used by emergency managers and transportation planners to better prepare WUI households for future wildfire events.",1361-9209,Not found
Race and income disparities in pedestrian injuries: Factors influencing pedestrian safety inequity,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103294,107,2022-06-01,2022,6,"Pedestrian injuries are growing as a share of traffic injuries. Further, pedestrian injury risk is not experienced equally across sociodemographic groups. National data and prior research shows that Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) and lower-income people bear a disproportionate burden. This study employs an ecological analysis to explore pedestrian safety disparities in Oregon, incorporating crash data, roadway and land use factors, and sociodemographic data. The analysis examines factors associated with increased pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as the impact of model specification including urban area random effects and mixed- versus fixed-effects models. Lower median income and higher proportions of BIPOC residents are found to be associated with more pedestrian injuries. These variables may be proxies for other traffic exposure and deficient built environment variables, which may reflect a lack of historic investment in the neighborhoods where these populations are concentrated.",1361-9209,Not found
Investigating factors influencing takeout shopping demand under COVID-19: Generalized additive mixed models,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103285,107,2022-06-01,2022,6,"The COVID-19 pandemic severely hampered the freedom of shopping travel while increasing individuals’ interest in takeout. Although many studies have examined takeout shopping, the available literature provides insufficient evidence on the factors influencing takeout shopping demand under the COVID-19. In this study, generalized additive mixed models were developed based on sampling data of takeout orders in Nanjing before, during, and post the pandemic to measure the associations between takeout shopping demand and neighborhood characteristics at the business circle scale. The results show that population density, house prices, road density, and catering all have a significant impact on takeout shopping demand, while the roles of land use (residential and company indexes) before and post the pandemic are opposite. Besides, the factors influencing the recovery of the demand before and after the pandemic were analyzed.

Liquefied biomethane for heavy-duty transport in Italy: A well-to-wheels approach,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103288,107,2022-06-01,2022,6,"While environmental benefits of biofuels in general are well known, the impact of liquefaction and carbon capture to the biomethane production chains are yet to be explored. Hence, a well-to-wheels (WtW) analysis of liquified biomethane (bio-LNG, or LBM) production chains was performed; Italy was chosen as case study, having more than 25% of EU methane refuelling stations. Despite increased emissions from the liquefaction process, LBM reaches a negative impact of −572 gCO2eq/km, as it addresses transport emissions and agricultural waste management at the same time. Nitrous oxides (NOx) emissions for biomethane and fossil fuels are mostly similar, as fuel combustion in the vehicle engine is a predominant source of NOx emissions compared to fuel production. The most intensive processes contributing to climate change were biomethane upgrading and liquefaction. Small-scale CO2 capture can provide additional GHG emissions reductions by 7.55 gCO2eq/MJ although this process is also more NOx-intensive compared to other production steps.",1361-9209,Not found
Time on the road and the price of Gasoline: Evidence from ATUS and NHTS,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103334,108,2022-07-01,2022,7,"What happens when motor fuel prices rise? In the US, the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) collects information about car ownership and use, and travel during a typical day, for over 100,000 households. It is conducted only once every eight years, and does not include a longitudinal component, making it difficult to observe drivers’ adjustments to changing gasoline prices. We experiment with combining the 2017 NHTS with eight waves of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which tracks trips, time spent traveling, and other characteristics of each trip. We find that the two datasets document remarkably similar behaviors—whether we use the eight waves of the ATUS or limit the comparison to the period when the two surveys overlap (April 2016 to April 2017). They also document similar responsiveness to prices—at least for the decision to take a car or a public transit trip. By contrast, minutes on the road and miles in the NHTS appear to be strongly responsive to gasoline prices, whereas minutes on the road from the ATUS are unrelated to fuel prices, despite the much greater price variation therein. The results are robust to extensive checks and efforts to reduce measurement error in gasoline prices. A 25-cent increase in the price of gasoline is predicted to reduce CO2 emissions by 1–5%.",1361-9209,Not found
Identifying specifications of in-use vehicles failing the inspection/maintenance emission test,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103327,108,2022-07-01,2022,7,"The objective of this study is to illustrate the vehicle deterioration by usage condition, and identify characteristics of vehicles that fail the Inspection/Maintenance emission test. Using the data sampled from the I/M program of Nanjing, China in 2018, we found vehicle mileage is a better indicator for the deterioration than vehicle age, and newer vehicles have higher deterioration rates than older ones. A random forest model was developed to predict the result of the emission test using vehicle specifications as independent variables. The specifications of vehicles that potentially violate the emission limit were also identified from the model. The result shows vehicles with engine displacement lower than 1.5L, less stringent emission standards, 10-year-old to 17-year-old, or cumulative mileage longer than 120,000 km have a higher probability to fail the test. The proposed method can be used to target on potential high emitters, which improves the efficiency of vehicle inspection.",1361-9209,Not found

Most studies among the available literature in the domain of vehicle ownership (aggregate and disaggregate) do not emphasise on city scale attributes. This study seeks to explore cities’ levels of 2-wheeler (2W) and 4-wheeler (4W) ownership across urban India using a large dataset (comprising 2,075 cities) from the Socio – Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011. Using exploratory factor analysis and multiple linear regression, we explore for significant differences in vehicle ownership levels between cities of different sizes. Apart from confirming the significance of some conventionally well accepted covariates, we determine that a city’s regional context also bears significant influence on its level of vehicle ownership. Findings from this study are likely to contribute towards urbanisation and economic development policies in a country which continues to add more cities and urban population.",1361-9209,Not found

Social factors, including low-income, visible minority status, and immigration have been associated with more AST. However, the mechanism by which they influence AST is not well understood, nor is their interaction with built environment features. This cross-sectional study examined associations between area-level social factors (material deprivation, ethnic concentration, proportion recent immigrants, proportion visible minority), and AST across 105 elementary schools in Toronto, Canada, controlling for multi-dwelling density and Walk Score®. A significant association between proportion recent immigrants and AST was found in adjusted analyses (OR = 1.54, 95 %CI:1.14–2.07, per 10% increase). No significant association was found with other social factors. In analyzing effect modification, social factors appeared to have stronger associations with AST in less walkable environments.

Progression of hurricane evacuation-related dynamic decision-making with information processing,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103323,108,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Conventional evacuation studies typically do not gauge the development of participants’ certainty about evacuation-related decisions with the updates in the information provided to them. This study uses an online survey that provides three kinds of progressively varied information about the current status of a hypothetical hurricane for five days leading to its landfall and collects respondents’ certainty of their situational comprehension and evacuation-related decisions each day. Most participants (84%) made a final decision (60% evacuate) after seeing information of just one day (four days before the landfall), indicating a tendency of swift decision-making. Modeling shows that the time spent looking at information, especially uncertainty cone forecast maps, positively influences the understanding of the hurricane’s status, which in turn helps in increasing the certainty of making evacuation-related decisions, with an increasing temporal effect. This study contributes to the understanding of the public perception of information and its association with evacuation-related decision-making.",1361-9209,Not found
Will river floods ‘tip’ European road networks? A robustness assessment,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103332,108,2022-07-01,2022,7,"River flooding is a profound climate hazard in Europe and a threat to its road transport infrastructure. However, its impact on road network interruptions is mostly unexplored, while some have suggested that national road networks may experience tipping points. This study assesses the robustness of road networks of European countries and their potential for a tipping point: an abrupt and disproportionally large loss of network functionality, due to unfavourable combinations of floods. Methodologically inspired by percolation analysis, ten-thousands of flood combinations are sampled and their impacts on road network performance are assessed. The results show that Albania, Croatia, Serbia and Austria are relatively vulnerable, whereas Belgium, Estonia, Lithuania and Portugal are relatively robust. Tipping points in the sense of nationwide network fragmentation seem unlikely, but regional-scale tipping points can happen.

In two small provincial cities, funding was provided to install walking and cycling infrastructure and run programs to promote and normalise active travel. We aimed to analyse effects five years after baseline along with changes in active travel for Māori and people on lower incomes. A total of 2,500 people were interviewed in person before the start of the intervention and four times subsequently. Some were part of a cohort that was surveyed more than once. Two matched control cities that did not receive the funding provided a comparison group. The program was associated with sustained increases in active travel rates in the intervention cities compared to the controls. Māori increased active travel rates considerably more than non-Māori, as did members of households with below median income.

Drivers for and barriers to electric freight vehicle adoption in Stockholm,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103317,108,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Freight transport in urban areas needs to become more sustainable. There is much potential to reduce emissions by transitioning to electric freight vehicles (EFVs). The context of this study is Sweden, a country with ambitious goals for transitioning to fossil-free road transport that incentivizes the adoption of EFVs through regulations, subsidies and environmental zones. However, it seems that few companies are adopting EFVs. This paper aims to explore why that is by investigating drivers for and barriers to the adoption of EFVs. An embedded case study of five firms in Stockholm that are exploring the possibilities of using EFVs is conducted. The findings reveal a number of drivers and barriers, which are then categorized as internal, external or governmental. The results show uncertainties at the micro, meso and macro levels. Uncertainties relate to political and legal uncertainties, technological and infrastructure-related uncertainties, customer expectations and willingness to pay, and operational uncertainties.",1361-9209,Not found
Synergies between repositioning and charging strategies for shared autonomous electric vehicle fleets,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103314,108,2022-07-01,2022,7,"The emergence of on-demand shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) service requires careful charging station planning and a joint charging and repositioning strategy to mitigate empty travel. This study couples charging and repositioning events as a means of improving service quality (rider wait times), reducing empty travel due to repositioning or charging, and improving fleet utilization (average daily trips per vehicle and charging queues). This synergy is explored for the Austin, Texas region using POLARIS, an agent-based model. On average, wait times were 39% lower, and average daily trips served per SAEV increased up to 6.4 (or 28%) compared to SAEV repositioning with heuristic charging. Coupling repositioning with charging decreased the fleet's percent empty travel on average by 1.6%, relative to the scenario treating them as independent events (which varies by charging station design). Sparser charging stations reduce investment costs, and operators can leverage this framework to keep traveler wait times low.",1361-9209,Not found
Governance and business policy impact on carsharing diffusion in European cities,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103312,108,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Congestion and pollution are common urban challenges. Among many policy measures, carsharing has been advanced as an instrument to mitigate adverse consequences of urban mobility. Municipal authorities have responded differently to its promises: some actively promote carsharing and public–private collaboration, others leave this to the market. Likewise, carsharing operators have revealed varying preferences for cities: in some they operate many cars and different business models, in other they are completely absent. Aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of governance support and business models on urban carsharing diffusion. Based on data about 170 cities in 30 European countries, we find that governance factors, like awareness campaigns and collaboration between the public transport and carsharing operators, favorably contribute to carsharing diffusion. Also, operators’ choices regarding free-floating or station-based carsharing affect diffusion. In all, these findings contribute to the development of urban policies aimed at promoting carsharing diffusion.",1361-9209,Not found
Willingness-to-relocate: Examining preferences for parking relocation of privately-owned automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103318,108,2022-07-01,2022,7,"Privately-owned automated vehicles (PAVs) can relocate themselves elsewhere after arriving at destinations, thereby inducing empty vehicle mile traveled (VMT) and more greenhouse gas emissions. This paper examines travelers’ preferences for PAV relocation, using stated preference surveys distributed in the Seattle and Kansas City regions in the U.S. Model results suggest that trip purpose, individual socio-economic and household characteristics, and local contexts influence PAV relocation decisions. Additionally, a willingness-to-relocate (WTR) metric is defined to represent how much time travelers would be willing to spend to relocate PAVs to save $1 in parking costs. The WTR estimates in both regions indicate the potential of induced VMT due to PAV parking relocation. Furthermore, travelers’ awareness of fuel/energy costs associated with PAV relocation does not necessarily relate to a lower WTR, depending on the region. To curb excessive empty VMT from PAV relocation, explicit disincentives, such as a VMT fee, may be needed.",1361-9209,Not found
Effects of trip-level characteristics on autonomous vehicle ownership: A U.S. analysis,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103321,108,2022-07-01,2022,7,"We examined how trip-level characteristics may influence autonomous vehicle ownership decisions.

Results suggested parking cost, travel cost and travel time are important predictors for vehicle ownership at the trip-level; and monthly payment, car ownership importance and autonomous vehicle safety perceptions are significant predictors at the consumer-level. By examining elasticities of vehicle ownership market shares, we found while consumer-level characteristics have the most prominent effect on vehicle ownership decisions, trip-level characteristics have a small but measurable effect. Among trip-level characteristics, parking cost has the largest impact on vehicle ownership decisions, followed by travel cost of ridehailing (both conventional and autonomous), and transit travel time. Finally, we simulated future vehicle ownership decisions under three policy scenarios by leveraging trip- and consumer-level characteristics.",1361-9209,Not found

However, existing studies have generally focused on the rutting depth and rutting life, and thus became insufficient for comprehensively evaluating the influence of climate change on rutting over the service life. A resilience assessment method for asphalt pavement rutting is developed to solve the above problem. First, the original resilience method is extended to fit the system whose performance level continues to decline. Then, the calculation formulas of rutting resilience are derived by combining the rutting prediction model and the level assessment model. Subsequently, the influence degrees of climate change in representative cities on rutting resilience are studied. The results suggest that neglecting climate change in rutting design of asphalt pavement will lead to insufficient resilience, especially in northern China.

A Vehicle Specific Power modal model was used to estimate trajectory-average fuel use and emission rates of CO2, CO, hydrocarbons, NOx, and particulate matter and to identify eco-driving trajectories. For route-level eco-driving, fuel use and emission rates reduction potential ranges from 6% to 40%, compared to average fuel use and emission rates estimated based on all trajectories. Eco-driving focused on fuel savings typically reduced air emissions and vice versa. Route-level eco-driving typically but not always concurrently reduces segment-level fuel use and emission rates.

In particular, we find that pro-environmental motives are the most frequently claimed self-image motives by consumers. However, compared with the mere existence of pro-environmental motives, the coexistence of all three self-image motives better explains consumers’ EV adoption decisions. Our findings provide a new grounding for the existing EV literature by exploring the combined effects of multiple self-image motives on consumers’ EV adoption decisions and revealing the intention-behavior gap caused by pro-environmental motives.

The impacts of heterogeneous traffic regulation on air pollution: Evidence from China,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103388,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Existing studies are mixed about whether two typical traffic regulation instruments, namely driving restrictions and new energy vehicle (NEVs) subsidies, reduce air pollution. Moreover, they focused on a single policy, neglecting the comparative analysis between different policies. Here, we apply the multistage difference-in-differences model to explore the environmental benefits of these two policies, and further compare their relative effectiveness. The results indicate that both restrictions and subsidies have positive effects on the overall air quality, but subsidies create more prominent benefits. From the dynamic effects perspective, the marginal benefit of restrictions is decreasing and eventually confronts the risk of failure, while subsidies have more effective long-term benefits. Furthermore, restrictions and subsidies reduce air pollution by alleviating congestion and stimulating the purchase of NEVs. Cost-benefit reveals that subsidies are more cost-effective under budget constraints. These findings are conducive to disentangling the emission-reduction capacity of different policies for effective pollution governance.",1361-9209,Not found
A disaggregate analysis of ‘excess’ car travel and its role in decarbonisation,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103377,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper measures ‘excess’ car travel for its role in decarbonisation. On average, each English adult travels around 5,680 miles a year and emits 1,006 kg of CO2. However, the top 5% ‘excess’ car users travel 4.8 times and emit 5.7 times the national average. Four binary logistic regression analyses were used to model the probability that people with specified characteristics belong to the ‘excess’ mileage and emitter groups. Results indicated that gender, employment and socio-economic status, household income (higher quintiles), company car availability, residential location and local population density were highly significant correlates of this ‘excess’ travel mileage. Multiple car ownership, business travel by car, multiple international flight frequencies and ownership of larger and diesel cars were positively associated with excess travel and emissions. A mileage rationing scheme targeting the top 20% users can cut emissions substantially (by 26%) compared to targeting ‘excess’ (top 5%) users only.",1361-9209,Not found
"Can government regulation, carbon-emission reduction certification and information publicity promote carpooling behavior?",10.1016/j.trd.2022.103384,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This study constructs a novel theoretical framework to uncover the effects of government regulation, carbon-emission reduction certification and information publicity on people’s carpooling behavior. Survey data on 1056 potential users from China were empirically examined using partial least squares structural equation modeling and multigroup analysis. The results reveal that government regulation and carbon-emission reduction certification can significantly improve users’ carpooling intention. Information publicity not only positively influences carpooling intention but also increases carpooling behavior. Interestingly, government regulation has a more significant effect on female users, users with high educational levels and young users. Carbon-emission reduction certification may negatively affect female users’ carpooling behavior. Information publicity is even effective at improving the older users’ carpooling intention. This research provides new evidence and serves as an insightful decision-making reference for policymakers and operators worldwide seeking to encourage people’s carpooling behavior.",1361-9209,Not found
Interaction mechanism between dual-credit pricing and automobile manufacturers’ electrification decisions,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103390,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The newly released dual-credit policy (DCP) in 2017 established a market-based credit trading scheme in China to facilitate the electrification transition of automobile manufacturers. However, it has not yet served its intended purpose perfectly. This study concerns the interaction between credit pricing and manufacturers’ electrification and develops a mathematical model of optimal investment timing and capacity utilization rate to investigate the traction mechanism and optimization strategy of the DCP. The results suggest that tightening the policy positively impacts electrification but does not necessarily lead to immediate investment by all manufacturers. Interestingly, while electrification leads firms to generate more credits to meet policy constraints, it promotes higher capacity utilization rates, resulting in equilibrium credit prices and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions potentially rising rather than falling. Furthermore, a novel government target indicator that includes economic and environmental aspects is introduced to help revise the DCP and advise automobile manufacturers on electrification decisions.",1361-9209,Not found
The NOx emission characteristics of gasoline vehicles during transient driving cycles,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103386,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"A fuel cut-off injection strategy can be employed during deceleration to increase fuel efficiency, but NOx is immediately emitted after fuel injection recovery. In this paper, the NOx emissions under various driving cycles are investigated. The NOx mass emissions from gasoline vehicles with a fuel cut-off strategy measured are much higher than those without a cut-off. More comprehensive and aggressive tests were carried out to analyse NOx emissions. The total NOx emissions can be classified as associated with warming up, fuel cut-off and other. The proportion of fuel cut-off-caused NOx mass emissions was the highest (61.2%) in real driving emissions 1 (RDE1) owing to its aggressive driving and frequent pedal switching. In comparison, for Worldwide harmonized Light duty vehicle Test Cycle (WLTC) and Random Test Standardized aggressive (RTS-95), warming-up induced NOx dominates, followed by fuel cut-off and other, while for both RDE cycles, fuel cut-off is the primary factor.",1361-9209,Not found

This inaccessibility has led to numerous lawsuits in major US cities. Some communities are proactively planning more equitable pedestrian infrastructure by developing barrier removal plans that can facilitate active transportation. However, limited research has explored the relationship between plans and more equitable pedestrian infrastructure. In this study, we leveraged Google Earth’s Street View and aerial imagery to evaluate whether having a barrier removal plan was associated with more accessible pedestrian infrastructure. We found that accessibility scores were higher for communities with plans compared to those without. We found no relationship between higher quality plans and better accessibility scores. Our results suggest that barrier-removal planning may support more equitable pedestrian infrastructure.

Five socio-psychological factors contributing to individuals’ evacuation intention under natural hazard conditions are identified from a literature review. These include attitude towards advice given by the authorities, risk perception, social norm, perceived behavioural control and preparedness intention. A conceptual framework is proposed based on the socio-psychological approach to model and analyse the evacuation intention. An online behavioural expectations questionnaire survey is conducted in Auckland, New Zealand, to investigate the evacuation decision-making behaviour of Aucklanders under a hypothetical volcanic eruption scenario.

Cost–benefit of a state-road charging system: The case of Denmark,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103330,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"We examine the welfare economic performance of fast charging infrastructure investments in Denmark by comparing the monetary value of waiting-time savings from increasing capacity with the cost of investment. Waiting-time calculations are based on interactions between a generalised queuing system and a microscopic space–time model of charging demand. The model allows calculating waiting-time distributions for a given capacity of chargers, leading us to determine the capacity required to fulfil different waiting-time guarantees and their welfare economic performance. The waiting-time distribution is a function of many key variables such as the speed of penetration, future charging speeds, and battery range of EVs. Since such inputs are highly uncertain, 24 scenarios for charging demand in 2030 are considered. These are based on different assumptions concerning technology and behaviour. We find that an efficient waiting-time guarantee, based on maximum waiting times, is approximately 10 min for a baseline scenario.",1361-9209,Not found

Meanwhile, in open-transaction electricity markets, diversified charging pricing schemes increase the complexity of cost-effective business and operational decisions. To this end, an extended EV routing model embedded with price-responsive charging decisions is proposed with three variants considering the contract, spot, and time-of-use (TOU) schemes. The price signals of the heterogeneous pricing schemes have different degrees of granularity. Furthermore, a thorough experimental study enabled by regional-level logistics instances and real-world electricity prices is conducted. The results demonstrate the cost-saving potential of the TOU and spot schemes. Additionally, the shifting of charging demands to low-priced periods is found in the spot and TOU schemes, thus enhancing the environmental benefits of charging events.

Such a system consists of two layers. In a bottom layer, an aggregated traffic model predicts the network dynamics. In a top layer, an emission model estimates the total exhaust emissions. This paper discusses how to properly calibrate the aggregated traffic models of the bottom layer, to then estimate the total network emissions. We focus on the calibration of travel distances and the network partition definition. We propose a methodology that utilizes the concept of the detour ratio as a proxy to model real travel distances within the aggregated traffic models. This methodology increases the effectiveness of aggregated traffic models for predicting network-wide emissions in realistic scenarios.

In case of developing countries, land use pattern varies significantly and it becomes very challenging to model the trip rates. In view of this, an effort has been made to synthesize the available literature related to modelling of trip generation rates. This paper provides a comprehensive review of studies related to impact of land use on trip rates, data collection techniques and modelling approaches. Major challenges associated with modelling of trip generation includes the unavailability of standard reference databases for multimodal trip generation, consideration of land use evolvement, less explored machine learning modelling approaches, and the feasibility of using emerging data collection techniques in travel surveys.

Connecting metros with shared electric scooters: Comparisons with shared bikes and taxis,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103376,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"The rapid rise of shared electric scooter (E-Scooter) systems offers urban areas a new micro-mobility solution. The focus on short-distance travel has made it a competitive option for addressing first-/last-mile travel needs. Nevertheless, its role as a first-/last-mile solution was understudied due to the lack of fine-grained trip data. This study aims at exploring the integration of shared E-Scooters with public transportation systems. Specifically, it compared the use of shared E-Scooters against shared bikes and taxis for connecting trips from/to metro stations. We analyzed massive amounts of trip-related data extracted through APIs. Multinomial logistic regression models were developed to uncover how the mode choices from/to metro stations vary in different contexts.

We monitored wildlife use of nine CS on a national highway in a critical tiger conservation landscape in India. 21 wild mammals were found to use the CS within a span of 2 years. Tigers, wild dogs, most small mammals and ungulates were found to use CS that were near protected area, while ungulates and small mammals preferred CS with proximal vegetation cover. High species richness was observed under large CS. Similar capture rates for large carnivores between CS and adjacent habitat were observed. We found varied responses by structure generalists and specialists, a consequence of animal behavior and tolerance to human disturbance.

Integrated optimization of charger deployment and fleet scheduling for battery electric buses,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103382,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Battery electric buses (BEBs) are considered effective options for sustainable mobility. Their operational efficiency is significantly influenced by the deployment of charging infrastructure and the scheduling of the bus fleet. In this research, we develop an integrated optimization model for charger deployment and fleet scheduling for BEBs under opportunity charging. The model jointly optimizes the battery nominal capacity, bus fleet size, and charger deployment at bus stops and the central terminal to minimize the total annualized costs. The time-varying characteristics of ridership, dwelling time, and travel time are considered to investigate realistic solutions with opportunity charging supplied by pantograph chargers. A real-life case study conducted in Oslo, Norway is presented to demonstrate the proposed model, and accordingly sensitivity analysis is further carried out to evaluate the system responses to a group of impact factors. The results indicate that BEB purchase costs and energy consumption rate have significant impacts on total annualized costs, and also imply that opportunity charging has a cost-effective advantage, which can save up to 13.38% of total annualized costs as compared to end station charging using the same type of pantograph charger.",1361-9209,Not found

However, few have attempted to forecast these equity benefits. This study seeks to contribute to the ongoing discussion by exploring potential equity impacts of a microtransit service in Metropolitan Detroit. Using a logsum accessibility measure calculated from a regional travel demand model, we simulate accessibility changes due to a hypothetical regional microtransit service and demonstrate a regional transportation equity analysis using a typical regional travel demand model. Our results show that accessibility gains would be slightly higher for lower income communities (17% increase compared with 13% for high income) and transit-dependent households (21% compared with 15% for car-owning households).

Optimising vehicle and on-foot porter routing in urban logistics,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103371,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"As modern cities expand, parcel carriers are obliged to deal with the various last-mile challenges of the urban setting, in order to meet the ever-increasing requirements of consumers while ensuring an eco-friendly distribution system. Some of the urban last-mile challenges, such as kerbside parking limitations and vehicle access restrictions, pose additional constraints to carriers that operate van-based deliveries. This paper describes a new distribution model and an associated optimisation problem, namely a vehicle routing problem with portering (VRP-P) with time windows, that integrates on-foot porters with cargo vans. In this distribution strategy, vans rendezvous with porters at handover points at selected customer locations where the transfer of parcels can take place, avoiding the need for designated parking spaces. The VRP-P is modelled as a mixed-integer linear programming formulation and solved on real delivery data in central London. The paper also describes a fast heuristic that uses several improvement operators. Computational results show that the use of portering yields time and carbon savings of up to 89%, depending on the number of customers served. The heuristic obtains high-quality feasible solutions in short computational times and outperforms a commercial optimiser on large scale instances. The findings also show high utilisation of portering even at limited parcel carrying capacities.",1361-9209,Not found
In-motion charged vehicle simulation considering traffic and power grid interactions,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103322,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"When designing new electric vehicles for urban transport, both vehicle producers and operators need to establish and verify requirements that the vehicle has to fulfil regarding, e.g., energy storage capacity, driving range, or battery wear.

At the same time, an expansion of the electric vehicle fleet may have a negative impact on the existing power grid. Sufficient dimensioning of the grid elements and their verification are therefore necessary to keep the electric transport service reliable.

We then juxtapose the clusters against empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) of their accessibility to develop an equity-driven planning framework that defines key areas for transport intervention.

We test for the mechanisms of the commute-depression link and find that commute is associated with depression as a direct stressor rather than triggering higher work stress. When decomposing commute time into mode-specific time, we found that time on mopeds/motorcycles has the strongest association with depression. Moreover, the commute-depression associations are stronger for older workers and blue-collar workers. Hence, policies that could reduce commute time, encourage work from home, improve job-housing balance or increase motorcyclists’ safety would help promote mental health.",1361-9209,Not found

In an application of this theory, we quantitatively explore consumer engagement with aspects of automobility related to car ownership and use. We identify seven potential constructs of “automobility engagement” that might help explain consumer interest in shared, automated, and electric mobility. We develop 40 questionnaire items based on a literature review and analyze survey responses from a representative sample of 3,658 Canadian respondents. First, we conduct exploratory factor analysis and identify seven factors, such as “Car Identity” and “Societal Concern”. We then explore the role of these factors in consumer interest in ride-hailing, carsharing, fully automated vehicles, and electric vehicles through regression analyses. We find that “Societal Concern” predicts interest in all innovations but carsharing, while other factors are more specific. We conclude that quantifying automobility engagement can help to understand consumer interest in innovations.",1361-9209,Not found
"Active travel and telework in Sweden: Teleworkers walk more, but cycle less",10.1016/j.trd.2022.103362,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"There is extensive literature on how telework influences daily travel, mainly focusing on daily travel demand. What is overlooked is the possibility that telework provides scope for more active travel on foot or by bicycle. The aim of this article is to investigate whether teleworkers are more likely to walk or cycle than non-teleworkers. We use representative microdata from the Swedish National Travel survey 2011–2016 and disaggregate the analysis in novel ways, including separating walking and cycling. We conclude that in general teleworkers walk more but cycle less. Teleworkers walk more for service purposes, and cycle less when commuting. The strongest correlation between telework and active travel are found when teleworking for a full day. However, similar active travel behavior is shown on non-(tele)working days, indicating that teleworking is habit-forming when it comes to active travel.",1361-9209,Not found
Can shared E-scooters reduce CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by substituting car trips in Germany?,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103328,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This paper explores which trips currently made in Germany by personal motorized transportation could be replaced by e-scooters and what effect this would have on greenhouse gas emissions. This potential for substitution is estimated on the basis of data from the national household travel survey in Germany. Our analysis shows that 13% of the daily car trips, corresponding to 2% of the car kilometers in Germany, are suitable for replacement. Based on these results, we show that saving potentials of greenhouse gas emissions are heavily dependent on the general conditions of the specific use case (e.g. e-scooter lifetime) and the type of vehicle replaced. At best, a saving potential of about 5.8kt of CO2eq per day could be achieved when trips with conventional cars are replaced by e-scooter driving. However, if battery electric cars are replaced, an increase in emissions may even occur under certain conditions.",1361-9209,Not found
Climate and air quality impacts of off-peak commercial deliveries,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103360,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"This study evaluates the potential impacts of off-peak delivery (OPD) for greenhouse gases and air pollutant emissions, with an application to the Greater Toronto Area. Multiple scenarios are formulated. OPD improves network congestion and travel times but increases vehicle kilometers travelled (VKT). The increase in VKT is attributed to road freight vehicles modifying their routing during the off-peak to longer routes. VKT generation is also attributed to induced passenger travel demand generated in response to improvements in traffic conditions during the daytime. Induced VKT plays an important role in limiting the reductions in greenhouse gases and nitrogen oxide emissions attributable to OPD. Yet, OPD scenarios reduce the emissions of fine particulate matter for both passenger and freight vehicles by reducing congestion. While total daily emissions either decrease or change minimally, the spatio-temporal distribution of emissions indicates increases in night-time emissions, particularly in communities located around highways and major arterial roads.",1361-9209,Not found

The maximum bearable cost, corresponding to different additives, was determined to assess the optimal choice of warm mix technologies. Results demonstrated that the addition of WMA additives lowers the heat energy by 3–12% compared to HMA. Although diesel is the most expensive fuel (considered in this study), its use can offset the cost of additives, for some WMA additives, namely: SR0.7, C0.2, C0.35, and R0.4. Calculations indicated that among the various warm mix additives, Sasobit Redux produces least emissions, followed by Aspha-min, Rediset, Sasobit, Cecabase, and viscosity graded binder.

Sustainability of thin layer road markings based on their service life,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103339,109,2022-08-01,2022,8,"Road markings are road elements that require frequent periodic renewals (not replacement) to maintain their key properties. To evaluate the impact of materials selection on sustainability of road markings, several representative products were tested in the field. The results revealed that the main impactor for their service life was selection of paint, followed by the choice of glass beads. The measured length of service life was used to calculate the consumption of resources for a series of renewals until end-of-life. The outcome clearly demonstrated that lowest carbon footprint was achieved with road marking materials that afforded longest service life, even if their composition was not environmentally friendly.

The level of this impact has been unevenly distributed among different population groups. The recent rise in anti-Asian racism implies that Asians have faced increased stress during the pandemic. As a result, the impact on their travel behavior is likely to differ from other ethnic groups. We examined this hypothesis by focusing on the impact of the pandemic on walking behavior. We collected survey data in Melbourne, Australia, during the pandemic lockdown, and analyzed the data using a Structural Equation Model approach. The results suggest that Asians experienced a significantly higher level of discrimination than other racial groups and were less likely to increase walking than White people. We also found that neighborhood cohesion helped alleviate perceived discrimination and promote walking. This study offers new insights into the role of racism in travel behavior.",1361-9209,Not found

This study investigated associations of area-wide air pollution and inclement weather with non-motorized travel at two trail locations in northern Utah (one recreational, one utilitarian). Rainfall, snowfall, high/low temperatures, and high wind speed were measures of inclement weather, and overall air quality index (AQI) measured air pollution. This study fit time-series (ARIMA) regression models for the utilitarian and recreational sites (separately), using multiple years of daily non-motorized counts. Non-motorized travel was reduced significantly during inclement weather, and the effects of rainfall and cold temperatures were smaller for the utilitarian site than for the recreational site. Counts at the recreational site were higher on holidays, weekends, and days with greater snow depth. Although non-motorized counts were lower on days with worse air quality at the utilitarian location, they were higher at the recreational location. Results are interpreted in terms of the discretionary nature of recreational travel, particulars of the location and elevation of the recreational site, and a desire to escape pollution through outdoor recreation in a natural area.",1361-9209,Not found

A static analysis using annual averages underestimates these values by 4 %. The ‘marginal’ emissions from BEV charging are 25 % higher than average emissions for CO2 and NOx, and 50 % lower for PM2.5. Smart charging was found to reduce average CO2 emissions by 10 % when compared to the typically charged vehicle; however, smart charging strategies may increase marginal emissions.

Cost assessment of alternative fuels for maritime transportation in Ireland,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103416,110,2022-09-01,2022,9,"In this study, we investigated the cost-effectiveness of four alternatives: Liquified Natural Gas (LNG), methanol, green hydrogen, and green ammonia, for the case of top 20 most frequently calling ships to Irish ports in 2019, through the Net Present Value (NPV) methodology, incorporating the benefits incurred through saved external, carbon tax and conventional fuel costs. LNG had the highest NPV (€6,166 million), followed by methanol (€1,705 million) and green hydrogen (€319 million). Green ammonia utilisation (as a hydrogen carrier) looks inviable due to higher operational costs, resulting from its excessive consumption (i.e., losses) during the cracking and purifying processes and its lower net calorific value. Green hydrogen remains the best option to meet future decarbonisation targets, although, a further reduction in its current fuel price (by 60%) or a significant increment in the proposed carbon tax rate (by 275%) will be required to improve its cost-competitiveness over LNG and methanol.",1361-9209,Not found

A genetic algorithm with an improved recombination strategy (GA-IR) is developed to solve these models. Computational results show that GA-IR outperforms GA in terms of convergence speed and solution quality, as GA-IR takes into account the empty trip removal process and the charging station re-insertion process, which is an innovation of GA-IR.

The intervention linked NO2 levels with the cycle time of the traffic lights. When NO2 levels exceeded a certain threshold, the strategy was triggered, which reduced the traffic congestion by turning the traffic lights green. Eight Earthsense Zephyrs air quality sensors and nine inductive-loop traffic detectors were installed in Thatcham to simultaneously monitor the air quality and traffic flows, respectively. Compared to the pre-intervention period, the observed NO2 concentrations decreased in June, July and August and increased in September 2021, however, this does not reveal the true effect of smart traffic intervention. Using the observed data on the days with- and without-exceedances, we developed two machine learning models to predict the Business-as-usual (BAU) air quality level, i.e., a generalised additive model for average concentration and a quantile regression model for peak concentration. Our results demonstrated that average predicted concentrations (BAU) were lower than the observed concentrations (with intervention) by 12.45 %. However, we found that peak concentrations decreased by 20.54 %.",1361-9209,Not found
Strategizing battery swap service: Self-operation or authorization?,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103411,110,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Electric vehicle (EV) charging is still time-consuming compared with traditional vehicle refueling, making many consumers hesitant to make the switch. As a solution, battery swapping allows EVs to get energized within minutes. As economies like China embrace the emerging battery swap market, relevant automakers face strategic choices between self-operation and authorization. This study establishes game-theoretic models of a duopoly EV market comprising two automakers and a battery swap market involving an additional third-party operator. Each automaker may run its own battery swap service entirely or license at least part of it to the third-party operator. The results suggest that authorization is typically optimal for a competitive automaker, as its collaboration with the third-party operator enhances both EV market demand and battery swap serviceability, leading to increased social welfare in 99% of simulated cases. Practical implications are discussed for promoting EV industry chain development with the new link of battery swapping.",1361-9209,Not found
A Bi-objective green tugboat scheduling problem with the tidal port time windows,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103409,110,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Tugboat assistance is essential when large ships are berthing and unberthing, and requires ports to produce efficient tugboat schedules considering various constraints. Few studies optimize tugboat scheduling from multiple vectors simultaneously, however. This paper thus constructs a bi-objective, mixed-integer linear programming, green tugboat scheduling model in order to minimize the maximum completion time and total fuel consumption, which improves port service levels, decreases tugboat company operating expenditures and thus environmental pollution emissions. The proposed model also considers the time window characteristics of the tidal port. We use the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) framework integrating the characteristics of tugboat scheduling to solve the model. Finally, we make a case study about Guangzhou Port to validate the model and the algorithm via a comparison of results solved by NSGA-II and CPLEX solver. The Pareto fronts obtained show the trade-off relationship between the two objectives, and provide a basis for port tugboat scheduling plans.",1361-9209,Not found
Modeling the preference of electric shared mobility drivers in choosing charging stations,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103399,110,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Electric vehicles for urban shared mobility services are important customers at public charging stations, and understanding their charging behavior is essential to the charging infrastructure planning and charging demand management.

The problem of road restoration is addressed by presenting a new variant of dynamic programming and a greedy heuristic. The model was applied to a multimodal transportation network that was struck by the earthquake and tsunami.

Factors affecting particulate matter levels near highway toll plazas in India,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103403,110,2022-09-01,2022,9,"Toll plazas are expected to have elevated levels of particulate matter (PM). However, this study through simultaneous measurements at two kerbside highway locations, reveals that PM concentration is higher at around 500 m from the toll plaza. This may be due to higher particulate emissions from vehicles while accelerating/ decelerating mode. Real-world driving approach was adopted using onboard emission monitoring instruments to find particle number concentration in the exhaust during different operating conditions. Subsequently, dispersion analysis was done using US EPA’s AERMOD, which complied with the measurements. Further, relationship between PM levels with traffic and meteorology was also investigated and found that traffic flow had a significant positive effect on PM. Measurements at toll plazas with different geometries divulged that staggered geometry plazas are expected to have highest PM concentration.

Using data from Chiba (Japan), this study employs a random forest method to fill this gap by revealing the non-linear associations of the built environment with active travel time among older males and females, and adopts a Shapley Additive exPlanations method to interpret the models. Results show that: (1) The dominant contributions to active travel time are gendered. For example, distance to a cafe/pachinko contributes more to males’ active travel time, while for females, population density contributes more. (2) The built environment attributes have non-linear associations with active travel time among older males and females.

We set up discrete route choice models and focus on the specific needs of women, people cycling with children, and older adults. Results show that all groups of interest show higher, but not fundamentally different, route requirements. In this context, lower speed limits for motorized transport are very important for people cycling with children, and older adults.

Specifically, we formulate the routing problem as a bandit problem and solve it with online algorithms. We extend the algorithms by implementing a path elimination mechanism to reduce the candidate path set and introducing the variance and covariance of the energy consumption to reduce the uncertainties. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently obtain near-optimal MECPs, and the solution is significantly better than the widely used shortest trip time path algorithm (STTP) and shortest trip distance path algorithm (SDP).

Generally, walkability measures rely on mesoscale attributes because of their ease of measurement. Walkability indices that combine built environment mesoscale and microscale characteristics are relatively new and have not yet been applied to assess the walkability of an entire city. Rather than focusing on the merits of such an index, this article reports the walkability assessment of all street segments in Bogotá (Colombia), highlighting differences in perceptions among pedestrian types and the uneven quality of pedestrian infrastructure throughout the city.

Factors influencing bike share among underserved populations: Evidence from three U.S. cities,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103471,112,2022-11-01,2022,11,"There is evidence that lower-income and people of color (POC) in the U.S. do not use bike share as much as higher-income and white people. Using data from residents living near stations in New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia, our analysis examines reasons for these disparities. While smaller shares of POC are members (vs higher-income white people), large shares of POC are interested in bike share. Among POC, having positive attitudes about bicycling and having family and friends that use bike share are strong predictors of interest in bike share. POC are also motivated to use bike share for recreational reasons. Receiving information from interactive sources may be effective at increasing bike share use and interest, though it is not clear whether these efforts have affected POC. Cost is a barrier for people who have tried bike share and are interested in using it in the future but are not members.",1361-9209,Not found
Autonomous electric vehicles can reduce carbon emissions and air pollution in cities,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103472,112,2022-11-01,2022,11,"Heavy dependence on personal vehicle usage made the transportation sector a major contributor to global climate change and air pollution in cities. In this study, we analyzed autonomous electric vehicles and compared their potential environmental impacts with public transportation options, carpooling, walking, cycling, and various transportation policy applications such as limiting lane-mile increases, and carbon tax. Fractional split multinomial logit and system dynamics modeling approaches are integrated to create a novel hybrid simulation model to process data from 929 metro/micropolitan areas in the U.S. for transportation mode choice behavior. The results show that the adoption of autonomous electric vehicles can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 34% of the total emissions from transportation by 2050. This study has revealed that transportation-related impacts can only be reduced with a paradigm shift in the current practices of today’s transportation industry, with disruptive reforms of automation, electrification, and shared transport.",1361-9209,Not found

Analyzing a nationally representative panel survey of adults, we find that 40–50% of workers expect to telecommute at least a few times per month post-pandemic, up from 24% pre-COVID. If given the option, 90–95% of those who first telecommuted during the pandemic plan to continue the practice regularly. We also find that new telecommuters are demographically similar to pre-COVID telecommuters. Both pre- and post-COVID, higher educational attainment and income, together with certain job categories, largely determine whether workers have the option to telecommute. Despite growth in telecommuting, approximately half of workers expect to remain unable to telecommute and between 2/3 and 3/4 of workers expect their post-pandemic telecommuting patterns to be unchanged from their pre-COVID patterns. This limits the contribution telecommuting can make to reducing peak hour transport demand.",1361-9209,Not found

A survey was conducted in November 2020, which collected responses from 1,000 Michigan residents statewide regarding walking and biking behaviors before, during, and anticipated post-pandemic. The survey found that people who walked or biked frequently for recreation before the pandemic maintained or increased their activities during the pandemic. More importantly, the survey also revealed differing pandemic-related impacts on walking and biking behaviors between sociodemographic groups. Specifically, people from underprivileged sociodemographic groups, such as those who are older, have lower education or income level, or identify as a minority, were less active in general before the pandemic, and these walking and biking behavior gaps were exacerbated by the pandemic. Furthermore, the elevated negative impacts on these sociodemographic groups were anticipated to continue in the future.",1361-9209,Not found

In a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of seven BEBs, we consider three battery technologies combined with relevant pack sizes to evaluate the size and range effect. The environmental performance of the BEBs was assessed over the typical length of a bus tender of 10 years as well as an extended lifetime of 20 years. Across six environmental impact categories we found that the size and range effect depends to a large extent on the performance of the battery technology and that a smaller battery size of the same technology is not necessarily environmentally preferable. Furthermore, extending the BEB lifetime from 10 to 20 years changes the environmental performance as well as relative contributions to environmental impact potentials for the various BEB alternatives.",1361-9209,Not found

Hotspot analysis indicates that the three disadvantages lack statistically significant spatial relationships. We associate perception-based disadvantages with the built environment and three underrepresented communities (i.e., minority, poverty, and aging population). Findings illustrate evident social disparities in perceived transportation disadvantages. Greater residential density is associated with less physical disability and less opportunity inaccessibility. Multimodal network density has a negative association with cost or effort disadvantages. The ratio of transportation costs to household income is positively associated with physical disabilities. Minority tracts perceive more physical and accessibility disadvantages.

Twenty-eight years of historical ice data have been combined to define the uncertainty level of ice thickness and concentration and converted to risk indexes using POLARIS, a risk management tool. The shortest travel times have been defined using the risk levels and a time-dependent shortest path algorithm. The results stress that the carbon tax is not antinomic with profit. Moreover, the use of hubs was not found to be economically advantageous for a majority of the examined scenarios. Furthermore, although it increases the overall emissions, this reduces the CO2 emissions per container due to the rise in the shipping volumes. Demand elasticity to transit time and to freight rates shows that the choice of hubs significantly impacts the NSR’s economic and environmental attractiveness.",1361-9209,Not found

We use the AUtomaker-consumer Model (AUM) to simulate the interaction of realistic consumer and automaker behaviour over the time horizon, with outputs including ZEV sales, GHG emissions, and policy costs (calculated as lost consumer surplus and automaker profits). All three policy types can potentially achieve the ZEV sales goal, though the ZEV mandate provides greater certainty. Further, the ZEV mandate is the most cost-effective way to meet the 2035 ZEV sales goal ($/tonne abated), followed by combinations of a ZEV-mandate with a VES. The feebate is costlier than the other policy types.",1361-9209,Not found

Furthermore, based on the system and indicators considered in LCA, the monetarization of direct and external costs of low-noise roads was included, in order to extend environmental interpretation to a monetary perspective. The modified LCA was applied in a realistic road test section, comparing (1) traditional stone mastic asphalt (SMA) with low-noise semi-dense asphalt (SDA) surfaces, and (2) different strategies for using SDA.

Neglecting cold-start emissions leads to an 82.0% underestimation of emissions at the network level. The results show that CO exposures are underestimated by 82.1%, 67.1%, and 88.8% for travelers walking, bicycling, and waiting at bus stops, respectively, when cold-start emissions are not considered.

Assessment of comprehensive energy systems for achieving carbon neutrality in road transport,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103487,112,2022-11-01,2022,11,"The world is seeking to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In general, electrification is a key measure in all sectors. Meanwhile, there are several emissions reduction options also in the road transport sector to achieve carbon neutrality when considering the energy system as a whole. Hydrogen, hydrogen-based synthetic fuels, and bioenergy can serve as alternative energy sources, and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, including direct air capture, can offset CO2 emissions from petroleum fuels. Comprehensive analyses that consider outlooks for both automobiles and energy supply with spatiotemporal variation are thus needed to explore possible strategies for the rational achievement of carbon neutrality. Our analyses, based on the integrated assessment model DNE21+, show that, although battery electric vehicles (BEV) are important, hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles, accompanied by the introduction of CDR and synthetic fuels, can play important roles.

The integrated approach developed the traffic noise prediction model with 62.4% explanatory power and identified direct and indirect effects of five influential factors on traffic noise. For instance, Traffic flow attributes, i.e., traffic volume and honking, are the most crucial ones to degrade acoustical climate at intersections. Besides, Built environment and Climate conditions induce only indirect effects on traffic noise.

A mathematical model and an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search heuristic are proposed for intermodal transport planning of carriers and fuzzy set theory is used to model the preferences towards eco-labels. For multiple carriers, centralized, auction-based collaborative, and non-collaborative planning approaches are proposed and compared. Real data from barge, train and truck carriers in the European Rhine-Alpine corridor is used for extensive experiments where both unimodal carrier collaboration and intermodal carrier collaboration are analyzed. Compared with non-collaborative planning without eco-labels, the number of served requests increases and emissions decrease significantly in the collaborative planning with eco-labels as transport capacity is better utilized.",1361-9209,Not found

Since these gravel tracks are deformed due to wear and weathering, they must be replaced at regular intervals. A large amount of fugitive dust(FD) is generated during the gravel replacement work, but research on the amount of generation has not been conducted. The characteristics of FD generated from railway maintenance vehicles (RMVs) operating on gravel tracks were investigated. FD concentrations were measured during the operation of three types of RMV machines: the multiple tie tamper (MTT), ballast regulator (RE), and ballast cleaner (BC). The concentrations of FD generated from MTT, RE, and BC use were 10.69, 16.58, and 17.55 mg/m3, respectively. Annual FD fluxes were calculated based on FD concentrations and emission speeds as well as annual RMV operating times. The EPA AP-42 provides a formula for calculating the FD generated by cars, but this formula is not applicable to railroad vehicles. In previous FD studies, FD flux was calculated using nearby wind speeds, but in this study, we took the speed of the force each RMVs applied during maintenance work as the emission speed.

Findings reveal a web of systemic and self-reinforcing barriers hampering market formation in all four dimensions. We also find that stakeholders perceive FCEV market barriers in relation to competing technologies; namely battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Faster market growth and lower hurdles for BEVs are thereby raising the relative barriers for FCEVs, further hampering the latter’s deployment potential. Findings thus reveal the importance of considering interactions between different technological systems when studying diffusion.

The data is from a household survey conducted in Shanghai in 2018. Using polynomial regression analysis with response surface methodology, the study finds that interaction effects significantly influence the affective component of travel satisfaction, but not the cognitive component.

We find telecommuting significantly increases people’s propensity to chain trips, raises trip chaining frequency, and encourages more complex trip chains. Furthermore, these impacts are significant on commuting days, which suggests that telecommuters still have different trip chaining behavior than non-telecommuters on the days when they commute to the workplace. While trip chaining has been encouraged under pandemic conditions to minimize health risks, heightened health concerns will fade as the pandemic recedes. With telecommuting likely to persist, unraveling how trip chaining behavior had changed in response to telecommuting before the pandemic helps policymakers better understand the long-term changes in travel behavior in the post-pandemic world.",1361-9209,Not found

Some users are even expecting these charging stations to deliver cheap electricity. However, from an economic perspective several arguments speak against this hope and, furthermore, the need of curbside chargers is often exaggerated in literature. Consequently, we shed more light into these two hypotheses (H1. curbside charging is very costly and H2. there is hardly any need for curbside charging) and base our arguments on current and representative mobility data from Germany. Policymakers may focus stronger on charging offers at workplace or shopping facilities for achieving an efficient allocation of charging infrastructure.",1361-9209,Not found
Joint optimisation for improving ship energy efficiency considering speed and trim control,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103527,113,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Operational optimisation is one of the most important methods for reducing energy consumption and emissions related to ships. In this study, a speed-trim joint optimisation method is proposed. First, the propulsion power for various operating conditions was estimated by numerical simulation, two-dimensional method, and ship-engine-propeller principle. Second, the obtained data, consisting of ship power, draft, trim angle, and speed, were further expanded to form a joint optimisation decision database using the artificial neural network method. Subsequently, a dynamic programming algorithm was used to calculate the optimal speed for each segment of the voyage. The optimal trim angle corresponding to the speed was obtained based on the joint optimisation decision database. Finally, a 7500 ton inland bulk carrier was chosen as the case ship to validate the proposed method. The results showed that the method could reduce the total ship power consumption by up to 7.64%.",1361-9209,Not found
Influence of using low-noise pavements on residents’ perception of road noise protection,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103531,113,2022-12-01,2022,12,"This paper presents an assessment of the effectiveness of low-noise road pavements, as well as impressions of the inhabitants concerning the influence of this solution on their comfort of life. Residents were surveyed before and after the new pavements were installed to determine their subjective opinion of the change in acoustic impact caused by traffic. Moreover, a high annoyance index was used to illustrate the impact of noise reduction on the health of people living in areas adjacent to the analysed road sections. The aim of this study is to compare the subjective perception of noise reduction by residents due to the use of low-noise pavements with the objective form of assessment, which is the analysis of the high annoyance index and the value of road noise reduction. The results obtained show a significant improvement in the subjective perception of the residents after the implementation of the new pavements.",1361-9209,Not found

We asked how frequently Californians grocery shopped before and during the pandemic, and how they may grocery shop afterward in-store, online with home delivery (“e-grocery”), or online with store/curbside pick-up (“click-and-pick”). We found that most Californians continued to grocery shop in-person during the pandemic, although less frequently than before. Many relied more on e-grocery (+8.9 %) and click-and-pick (+13.3 %), although older generations remained attached to in-store shopping. African American households grocery shopped in-store less than Whites pre-pandemic; post-pandemic, they may compensate with more e-grocery and click-and-pick. While higher levels of environmental injustice (based on CalEnviroScreen) were associated with less in-store shopping, we found no association with e-grocery or click-and-pick.

Effective urban planning depends on understanding the magnitude of changes resulting from policy measures, both within and surrounding intervention areas; these are largely unstudied in the case of Low traffic Neighbourhoods (LTN). We evaluated impacts of three LTNs in the London Borough of Islington, UK, on air pollution and traffic flows in and around intervention areas, based on monthly Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and traffic volume data provided by the local authority. We identified pre- and post-intervention monitoring periods and intervention, boundary and control sites. We then adapted the generaliseddifference in differences approach to evaluatethe effects within LTNs and at their boundary. We found that LTNs have the potential to substantially reduce air pollution and traffic in target areas, without increasing air pollution or traffic volumes in surrounding streets.

A transport justice approach to integrating vulnerable road users with automated vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103499,113,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to revolutionise transport worldwide and transform urban life. However, there are many unknowns concerning the impacts of these technologies in terms of sustainability, justice, and safety. It has been suggested that CAVs may exacerbate inequities and safety disparities concerning the interaction of vulnerable road users (VRUs) with motorised transport. This paper investigates the justice issues that CAVs policy needs to address concerning VRUs. Our approach to studying CAVs’ capabilities and their potential perverse outcomes uses transport justice as an evaluative framework. The justice-related outcomes discussed include: traffic injuries, impact on sharing road responsibilities, loss of on-street space, access to technology, inclusion for disabled and older adults, CAV technological development, and impact of congestion and air pollution.

To confirm the relationship between the development of CCLFAP and regional carbon emissions (RCE), bivariate global and local Moran's I are used. Further, Geographically Weighted Regression and Multi-scale Geographically Weighted Regression methods are used to determine the impact of CCLFAP on RCE. The results show that the development level of CCLFAP and RCE exhibit a significant positive correlation. The influence of the seven significant influencing factors on RCE varies significantly across space.

However, NP-derived models seldom consider the compactness of station areas and their interactions with urban structures. This work extended the NP model by introducing two concepts of compactness and urban vibrancy. Moreover, a scoring approach was proposed to measure the overall TOD level to facilitate inter-city comparison. This work conducted a comparative study of two megacities, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and found that Shenzhen is better in overall TOD performance. When examining specific dimensions of performance using clustering methods, we found significant discrepancies in both cluster characteristics and spatial distributions, with Guangzhou exhibiting a core-periphery spatial pattern and Shenzhen a polycentric structure.

However, successful V2G adoption requires direct interaction with the EV user. To explore user preferences and requirements in the context of a V2G charging tariff, we conducted a survey (N = 1196). We assess users’ minimum range requirements and willingness to pay for a V2G charging tariff and relate them to users’ experience with EVs. By building a mediation model, we evaluate the importance of three charging strategies to guide users’ minimum range requirements and expected monetary savings. The results reveal EV owners’ preference for a climate-neutral charging strategy, leading to a higher readiness to accept lower minimum ranges and lower monetary savings. These results are especially important to aggregators, aiming to design profitable business models, while accounting for user requirements and preferences.",1361-9209,Not found
Charging behavior modeling of battery electric vehicle drivers on long-distance trips,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103490,113,2022-12-01,2022,12,"Using the data from an interactive stated choice experiment, we analyzed battery electric vehicle (BEV) users’ fast-charging choices on long-distance trips using both static and dynamic discrete choices models (SDCMs and DDCMs). The results show that battery state of charge (SOC) and the ability to reach the next station without deviating from the original plan are the primary factors influencing charging decisions. Charging cost, time, the detour time to reach a station, and the amenities are statistically significant predictors, but less important than SOC and the ability to complete the trip as planned. The comparison of the SDCMs and DDCMs shows that SDCMs have better goodness-of-fit than more complicated DDCMs. By comparing the relative size of the coefficient, we estimated the monetary value of increasing charging power, moving the charging stations closer to highway exits, and having amenities such as restrooms, restaurants, and Wi-Fi at the charging stations.",1361-9209,Not found

We develop an evolutionary game model from the perspective of the vehicle owners and the property companies based on prospect theory to solve this dilemma. The system dynamics is innovatively utilized to investigate the mutations in evolution, and a specific incentive mechanism is further designed. The results show that: (1) installing private chargers is difficult due to the conflict of interest between the vehicle owners and property companies. The solution to this problem is to increase the property companies’ support proportion; (2) dynamic incentives for the property companies can keep the proportion of positive strategies adopted by both parties at a high level. The earlier the intervention, the faster the stability is reached; (3) property management cost and loss of safety hazards are essential factors that must be kept within reasonable limits to prevent them from negatively impacting the incentive effect; (4) amplifying subjects' perceived value of losses and lowering their risk preference can achieve a better incentive effect.",1361-9209,Not found

Relationships of life satisfaction with commuting and built environment: A longitudinal analysis,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103513,114,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Although detrimental effects of commuting have been widely researched, little longitudinal evidence can be found regarding whether changes in commuting time and modes cause changes in life satisfaction. This study examines the relationships of life satisfaction with commuting from a longitudinal perspective. The effects of built environment are also examined. Using longitudinal survey data from 4505 respondents in China, the findings show that the increase in commuting time associates with losses in life satisfaction. Switching from non-active modes to active modes associates with increases in life satisfaction. Nonetheless, switching from active modes to non-active modes only reduces life satisfaction for people who experienced changes in some specific built environment attributes (e.g., increasing population density). Most changes in built environment associate with life satisfaction changes.

Considering all cap tightening, credit offsets, and possible subsidies, the electric fleet outperforms the other options in both economics and emission reductions. The findings have important implications for sustaining the low-carbon municipal waste management.",1361-9209,Not found
Pollution and noise reduction through missed approach maneuvers based on aircraft reinjection,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103574,114,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Skyrocketing prices of fuel and increasing concerns towards achieving lower carbon footprints favor any improvements towards a greener transportation ecosystem. In this work we focus on missed approaches, which are forced maneuvers at the end of regular flights that generate significant noise and pollution levels near airports. In a previous work we introduced a reinjection technique for this maneuver able to substantially mitigate such negative effects. To confirm this point, in this work we compare this technique with a conventional procedure by using well-known models, such as the ECAC Doc. 29 noise model and the BADA aircraft performance model. A noise map at the ground level and a measure of the diffused pollutants have been obtained, confirming the lower ecological impact of the reinjection technique. Compared to the conventional maneuver, the reinjection-based approach obtains a reduction of about 80% in pollutant emissions, while the affected area for equivalent noise level thresholds is reduced to nearly half.",1361-9209,Not found
Analyzing barriers for implementing new vehicle scrap policy in India,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103568,114,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Developed countries have already implemented a vehicle scrap policy that prevents the on-road usage of old vehicles beyond a certain age to curtail pollution. Recently Indian government also announced its plans and policies for vehicle scraping. There is a multitude of barriers to the implementation of such a policy in India. This paper identifies and models all implementation barriers. Literature review and interactions with various stakeholders helped to identify the barriers. The identified barriers are processed with a hybrid methodology, which is a combination of the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy process and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory. The data is modeled in a fuzzy context to account for issues of ambiguity and subjectivity. This study helps policymakers and other stakeholders by identifying the barriers to vehicle scrap policy implementation in India.

Environmental burden of different transport modes – Real case study in Slovakia,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103552,114,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The scope of this work is to prove the strong influence of the real vehicle composition according to its age to the real environmental burden of the evaluated transport mode and calculation of the suitable vehicle fleet composition (share of different age groups, tractions and emission standards) to secure lower emission production (NOx, PM and greenhouse gases) of railway transport. These results represent the current state with regard to the composition of the vehicle fleet of freight carriers in terms of age, type of traction and emission class. The results were reached using data from average fuel consumption of the vehicles considering the specific standardised values of produced emissions. Taking the W-t-W principle into account, these results are surprising, as they contradict the generally declared claims concerning the environmental burden of individual transport modes, when the vehicle fleet's structure influences the generation of emissions more than the transport mode itself.",1361-9209,Not found
Modelling the interaction between the energy system and road freight in Norway,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103569,114,2023-01-01,2023,1,"By soft-linking models for transport demand, vehicle turnover and energy generation and use, we show how such models can complement each other and become more relevant and reliable policy support tools. A freight demand model is used to project commodity flows onto the 2050 horizon. An energy system model is used to map the relationships between energy prices, fiscal incentives, and optimal vehicle technologies. A stock-flow vehicle fleet model is used to calculate the time lag between innovation affecting new vehicles and the penetration of novel technology into the fleet. By running the latter two models in an iterative loop, we predict the flow of new vehicles with more or less decarbonized powertrains, contingent upon energy prices and fiscal incentives, while also obtaining a well-founded and more realistic assessment of the time needed for radical CO2 mitigation. The methodology is illustrated through a scenario developed for Norway.",1361-9209,Not found

In addition, limited studies examined the moderating effect of COVID-19 on the price effects of to-metro and by-metro accessibility. Based on multilevel hedonic price and quantile regression models, this study scrutinizes the association between to-metro accessibility, by-metro accessibility, and house prices in Chengdu, China, and examines the moderating role of COVID-19 in this association. We show that by-metro accessibility significantly influences house prices. COVID-19 significantly influences the value of to-metro accessibility but marginally affects that of by-metro accessibility. The value of to-metro accessibility is disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Specifically, small or low-priced houses are less affected than big or high-priced houses. In other words, the flattening of the to-metro price gradient is more discernible for big or high-priced houses. The changing preference of residents has also been verified by the decreases in house transaction volume in metro-adjacent areas.",1361-9209,Not found

This paper investigates pandemic impacts on PT safety and stress perceptions in three Nordic cities, drawing on 2018 and 2020 survey data analysed in structural equation models. While finding modest pandemic effects on safety and stress perceptions overall, strong heterogeneities exist across gender, age and geographic categories. Women perceive less PT safety and more stress, especially during the pandemic. Older adults reduced PT more during the pandemicandperceived no stress reduction like younger adults.

Time-based-fuel-efficient aircraft descents: Thrust-idle descents along re-negotiated routes vs. powered descents along published routes,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103563,114,2023-01-01,2023,1,"We address the situation where required times of arrival (RTAs) are assigned outside the feasible time window that allows aircraft to fly energy-neutral continuous descent operations (CDOs). Two strategies to achieve these RTAs are compared by means of simulated optimal trajectories and in terms of fuel consumption: powered descents along the published arrival route vs. energy-neutral CDOs along re-negotiated routes. A sensitivity study to different parameters led to results primarily for RTAs later than the estimated time of arrival. With strong-tailwind, stretching the route and flying neutral CDOs improves the efficiency of the operation. Light aircraft also benefit from being assigned longer pre-defined routes, while for heavy aircraft it is more efficient to fly powered descents along the published route. This paper could contribute to enhance ground-based decision support tools for air traffic controllers, aiming to manage arrival traffic more efficiently and reducing the overall environmental impact of arrival operations.",1361-9209,Not found
Collaborative optimization of electric bus line scheduling with multiple charging modes,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103551,114,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Due to the characteristics of electric buses, such as mileage limitations, multiple charging modes, and long charging times, traditional vehicle scheduling and driver scheduling strategies cannot meet the requirements for electric bus line scheduling. To address this issue, we propose a collaborative optimization model for establishing vehicle schedules, charging plans and driver schedules for electric bus lines incorporating three charging modes: fast charging, slow charging and battery swapping. The proposed model is solved by a two-stage solution algorithm based on “Generation and Selection”. Case studies are carried out on bus lines in Beijing. The results show that the proposed model can reduce the costs of bus companies and improve the utilization rate of buses and drivers. In addition, the results indicate that bus line length has an important impact on the selection of charging mode.",1361-9209,Not found
Consumers' preferences for electric vehicles: The role of status and reputation,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103530,114,2023-01-01,2023,1,"This paper provides insight into motivational reasons for consumers' preferences for Electric Vehicles (EVs) assuming equal and different prices between EVs and traditional vehicles. Referring to consumer behavior, it shows that reputation-driven consumers prefer EVs only when the purchase price is more expensive than that of other vehicles, thus suggesting that true environmental concern is attenuated by reputation motives; and that the desirability of EVs as sustainable products only increases if prices are more expensive. It provides insights into the influence of sociodemographic variables, car attributes and external environmental factors. The study offers an empirical approach with a sample set of more than 2.000 responses. Different logit models are estimated to explore the factors influencing the preference for an EV. It is found that age, being male, having children, education, living in urban areas, and previous experience positively influence EV adoption.

Infrequent inspections, inadequate data on foundation depths, and the lack of consideration of hydrologic and climate parameters often result in uncertainties within current scour risk assessments. This paper presents an approach for assessing the risk progression of local scour in peak flow conditions that consider uncertainties associated with location, downscaling of climate predictions, and hydrologic, hydraulic and scour prediction models. A rational scour risk rating based on warning time to failure is introduced that can provide a useful addition to the existing bridge condition indexes. The case study on a set of railway bridges in Southeast England shows that climate change could accelerate the scour risk progression, even in the low-emission scenario.

We find that, first, the USA, the UAE and China will be affected most if the mechanism is changed from CORSIA to another. Second, CORSIA is a good choice for the USA, Germany, France, and Australia, while other countries with the highest revenue tonne kilometers in international aviation may have strong motivations to change from CORSIA to AP or EP. Third, EI does not bring the lowest cumulative offsetting costs for any country, but is most similar to the compounding mechanism under PSC.

Regression analysis is used to assess the relationships between station utilization and several contextual and environmental factors. We conclude that local EV adoption is a strong indicator of utilization; L2 station utilization decreases with the size of the local charging network, while DCFC stations are less affected; and increased charging power has a greater effect on utilization for DCFC stations than L2. This study fills a critical research gap by reporting updated public charging station utilization statistics and analysis for the U.S. market.",1361-9209,Not found
Adolescents' environmental perceptions mediate associations between streetscape environments and active school travel,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103549,114,2023-01-01,2023,1,"Promoting adolescents’ active school travel may support their health and wellbeing.

Results showed that street safety, vitality, greenery, and vehicle volume were positively related to odds of active school travel, while higher pavement ratio was associated with lower odds of active school travel. Street safety, pavement ratio, and vehicle volume were related to active school travel through perceived walkability, while street vitality and vehicle volume were associated with active school travel through the perceived safety-walkability path and perceived air pollution-walkability path.

Internal and external costs are used to evaluate alternative intermodal chains for a set of pairs origin/destination extending to a range of regions in Northern Europe. Short sea shipping is competitive for a large set of destinations and its scope of competitiveness does not change significantly between different scenarios.

Local accessibility at the residence and workplace are the most important correlates of CBS use, followed by the proximity of workplace to bus stop. Some built environment variables (including distance from workplace to transit stops, distance from residence to business centers, and population density) influence CBS use differently from traditional transit use observed in the literature.

Brownian bridge-based speed imputation technique for truck energy consumption and emissions estimation,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103546,114,2023-01-01,2023,1,"The available truck Global Positioning System (GPS) data, typically collected with large time gaps, rely on imputation techniques to obtain second-by-second data that are required in models for estimating truck energy consumption and emissions.

To fill the gap and effectively apply the low-resolution truck GPS datasets, this paper proposes a simple imputation technique that adopts the Brownian bridge structure to impute missing speed data. The proposed technique introduces a feasible imputation region and a combined drift into the imputation procedure to capture vehicle acceleration constraint, travel distance constraint, and speed volatility. The calibrated model is applied to a set of low-resolution truck GPS data.

Conflict assessment and resolution of climate-optimal aircraft trajectories at network scale,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103592,115,2023-02-01,2023,2,"Aviation contributes to anthropogenic climate change through carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and non-CO 2 emissions. Due to dependency on atmospheric conditions, the non-CO 2 climate impacts can be mitigated using aircraft trajectory optimization. However, adopting independently optimized trajectories may not be operationally feasible for the air traffic management system due to the associated impacts on the safety, demand, and complexity of air traffic. This study aims to explore the effects of employing climate-optimized trajectories on air traffic complexity in terms of the number of conflicts and propose a strategic resolution based on speed change to resolve the conflicts that arise. A scenario with 1005 flights is considered as the case study. The results indicate that the adoption of climate-optimal trajectories increases operational cost and the number of conflicts. Employing the proposed resolution algorithm, it is shown that the conflicts can be resolved by accepting slight increases in climate impact and cost.",1361-9209,Not found

Bi-objective airport slot scheduling considering scheduling efficiency and noise abatement,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103591,115,2023-02-01,2023,2,"This paper aims to explore the contribution of slot allocation to noise abatement at schedule coordinated airports. To this end, we first build a single-airport bi-objective model that incorporates scheduling efficiency and noise reduction. We then find and analyze a solution that maximizes airport noise reduction with the greatest allocation efficiency. The price of noise reduction is proposed to gain the trade-off between efficiency and environmental benefits. Our research shows that slot scheduling can reduce noise at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. The maximum noise reduction schedule shows high fluctuation in the temporal distribution of slots. The price of noise reduction is very high under the maximum noise reduction schedule, and the required displacement to reduce one unit of noise increases sharply as the noise reduction value rises.

Here, we developed a stock dynamics model and a scenario analysis for direct energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by different combinations of the revolutions in Switzerland. The largest climate change mitigation potential is provided by combining ACs with ride-sharing with rapid fleet electrification, i.e. completely phasing out new gasoline and diesel cars by 2025 and new hybrid cars by 2030.

We illustrated the utility of this framework by applying it to Los Angeles, CA, estimating changes in mortality risk that might be expected from shifting a 2.5-mile daily car trip to cycling for five years. This shift was associated on average with a 12.4% net reduction in mortality risk, and a 50% increase in cycling could prevent approximately 600 deaths over five years.

Accordingly, the PM2.5 concentrations were monitored at stations adjacent to and two- and three-stations distant from the river-tunnel. Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to disentangle how proximity to a river-tunnel and other factors (e.g., depth) influence concentrations. Stations adjacent to a river-tunnel had 80–130% higher PM2.5 concentrations than more distant stations.

Two major findings were obtained from the hierarchical linear modelling. First, the non-motorized travel rate of residents living in the same place varies greatly with their space–time activity patterns, and the variation over different activity patterns is greater than that over space. Residents with more flexible activity patterns are more likely to undertake non-motorized travel. Second, a higher population density is associated with a lower proportion of the whole-day-flexible residents, which indirectly reduces the non-motorized travel rate.

Although the trends in transit development, shared mobility, e-commerce, and lifestyle changes offer optimism about American cities becoming more multimodal, policymakers should consider these differences in socioeconomic factors and try to provide more equitable access to sustainable mobility across different socioeconomic groups.",1361-9209,Not found
Mode choice and the first-/last-mile burden: The moderating effect of street-level walkability,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103646,116,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The first and last mile (FLM) of transit trips are associated with physical activity, often placing a burden on transit users. FLMs that are short, safe, and convenient to walk could facilitate transit use. Using household travel survey data of the Seoul metropolitan area, we examine how walkability features (e.g., greenness, building and sidewalk density, and level of enclosure) of the FLM mitigate the burdens associated with the FLM. Our results suggest that designing better walking environments could encourage more transit use for low-income commuters, which further provide planning implications for equity. We also find that the moderating effect of walkability is slightly larger for the first mile compared to the last mile. Using urban design practices that enhance walkability, the significance of the FLM burden can be mitigated, further promoting transit use.",1361-9209,Not found
Push and pull strategies to increase the uptake of small electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103638,116,2023-03-01,2023,3,"The demand for larger, heavier, and high range battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is growing. When relying on car utilization, smaller cars with sufficient battery range for typical daily distances could reduce greenhouse gas emissions, consumption of raw materials and pedestrian fatalities. Within our stated preference study with 844 participants, we used a combination of push and pull measures to motivate conventional car users to switch to a small BEV for everyday trips and mobility services for long-range trips. Our results suggest that up to 30% of conventional car owners would be open to switch to a small BEV in combination with mobility services. This can be increased to 41% through improved charging possibilities at home and at work. Combined with a fundamental CO2 tax on fuel, up to 67% would switch. The results are relevant for transport planners and politicians in designing efficient strategies to increase the uptake of small BEVs.",1361-9209,Not found
Non-linear effects of street patterns and land use on the bike-share usage,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103630,116,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Few studies have examined the influence of street configurations, and the built environment may have a more complex effect on bike-share usage than the linear associations typically modeled. Given the spatio-temporal correlation and nested data effect in the data from Xi’an, we applied generalized additive mixed modeling (GAMM) to address the effects of street configurations and land use on the number of bike-share trips and the number of trips stratified by districts. Street configuration is measured by average geodesic distance, network betweenness, and intersection density. The models suggest that a higher average geodesic distance was linked to the reduced number of arriving and departing bike-share trips (although it needs noting that land-use mix was excluded given the correlation with average geodesic distance). Moreover, land use density showed an inverted u-shape association with departures and arrivals.",1361-9209,Not found

We used New York City as the study area, and one-day GPS trajectories of 3,133 buses were analyzed to develop the micro-simulation approach, so as to represent the bus operation well. The results showed that the scenario with both charging posts and WCLs deployed had a significantly higher level of service (with its total delay time being 48.11% shorter), more energy saved and fewer emissions than the scenario with only charging posts deployed, though its total cost was 0.76% higher.

We simulate charging infrastructure needs using a large-scale agent-based simulation of Sweden with detailed individual characteristics, including dwelling types and activity patterns. The two state-of-art archetypes of charging behaviors, “Plan-ahead” and “Event-triggered”, mirror the current infrastructure built-up, suggesting 2.3–4.5 times more public chargers per BEV than the “Liquid-fuel” mental model.

We implemented a choice experiment with a large sample of current BEV (N = 950) and non-BEV (N = 1,881) holders to examine the relevance of several design features that are widely presumed to be important in this regard: waiting (queueing) time, charging time, price, energy source, and amenities. Mean queueing time turns out to be most relevant, and car holders are also willing to pay for limiting or avoiding (uncertain) queueing times. The main implications for commercial and public charging infrastructure providers are that they should seek to provide fast charging, real-time observability of charger occupancy, and the opportunity to reserve chargers.",1361-9209,Not found
Joint associations of environmental and sociodemographic attributes with active and sedentary travel,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103643,116,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Promoting physically active travel (walking + cycling) is a key strategy to enhance population health. It is important to understand for whom and where active and sedentary travel (car use) are common. However, little research has investigated how attributes of people and places interact in influencing these travel behaviors. Using travel survey data collected from 41,628 Australian adults, we employed decision tree modeling to untangle such complex relationships and to assess the relative importance of sociodemographic and environmental attributes in influencing active and sedentary travel durations. For active travel, attributes of places (suburb-level population density, distance to the nearest city center) were the most influential determinants. For car use, those two environmental attributes interacted with sociodemographic attributes (age, work status, household income) to form subgroups. Decision tree modeling appears to be effective to identify at-risk subgroups that may benefit from policy interventions.",1361-9209,Not found
Optimal compliance choices for ocean carriers under the sulphur regulation,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103639,116,2023-03-01,2023,3,"This paper investigates how carriers adapt to the sulphur regulation by choosing between sulphur scrubber (SS) and fuel switching (FS). A cost minimization model is proposed to determine the optimal compliance choices, considering factors such as fuel prices, capital cost difference between SS and FS, and shipping service profile. We find that the optimal choice depends on the tradeoff between the capital cost advantage of FS and the fuel cost advantage of SS. And such a tradeoff is moderated by the vessel’s annual fuel consumption. Ignoring the speed differentiation behavior of FS vessels would exaggerate the benefits of SS. But whether it can cause a wrong compliance choice depends on the extent of overestimation, which depends on the presence in emission control areas and fuel prices. When fuel price volatility is factored in, a portfolio of FS and SS might be better than simply choosing either one for all vessels.",1361-9209,Not found

Charging is characterized in seven clusters based on charging location type, power level, and time of day. Drivers ascribed to each cluster are described in terms of their socio-economic and demographic descriptors, EVs they drive, and charging behaviors not used to create clusters. Multivariate modeling on hours per week driving on TNCs indicates charging behavior is correlated to hours driving. Also, drivers’ commitment to being a TNC driver has a larger effect than does commitment to driving an EV.

How to define and achieve Zero-Impact emissions in road transport?,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103619,116,2023-03-01,2023,3,"In a novel approach, emission and air pollution aspects are combined to determine vehicles that “do not affect” air quality. First, the term “Zero-Impact Emissions” is defined. A compliance test matrix is developed consisting of seven different scenarios, with individual boundary conditions such as dilution, ambient conditions, traffic volume, and cold start share. The average fleet emissions required to achieve Zero-Impact Emissions range from 33 mg/km NOx for an uphill Brenner drive down to 6 mg/km for a high-traffic highway. Finally, simulation models with state-of-the-art exhaust aftertreatment are used to test the scenarios for a gasoline passenger car and a light-duty diesel vehicle. The results demonstrate that Zero-Impact Emissions compliance depends strongly on the boundary conditions. In the High Alpine Uphill and High Traffic Brenner scenarios (typical emission worst-cases), this can already be achieved, while scenarios with high traffic volume or high cold start share require additional measures.",1361-9209,Not found

A set of commonly used models that describe the relationships between speed, flow and density has been fit to the data and compared to the model from the Highway Capacity Manual. In evacuation scenarios, the vehicle speed is about 3.5 km/h lower in comparison with the speed in routine scenarios, both for low and high traffic density.

The impact of perceived injury risk and psychosocial factors on walking equity,10.1016/j.trd.2022.103590,116,2023-03-01,2023,3,"Walking is the cornerstone of active and sustainable transport. However, traffic safety concerns among pedestrians could reduce walking behaviour. Safety concerns are generally measured through risk perceptions. Unfortunately, a lack of theoretical development of risk perceptions in walking behaviour research has limited our capacity to identify groups of pedestrians who are inequitably affected and address their concerns. To address this gap, the present investigation identified various theory-driven risk dimensions (i.e., mechanism of injury, temporal risk dimensions, and information processing). Logistic and hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of the risk dimensions on walking behaviour while considering psychosocial factors (e.g., attitudes and social norms). The findings suggest that policymakers and practitioners should consider both objective and perceived pedestrian safety to promote sustainable mobility.

To solve this problem, a model is proposed: (1) At the construction stage, carbon emissions generated by building material production and mechanical energy consumption are computed. (2) At the operation stage, train traction energy is converted into carbon emissions. (3) At the maintenance stage, carbon emissions generated by track replacement and structural maintenance are analyzed. (4) Moreover, the loss of carbon sink during a railway’s life is estimated.

Our findings show that the daily car substitution rate, including both “private car” and “ride-haling,” was 28% on weekdays. This dock-less bike-share service was responsible for an estimated VMT reduction of 2,131 vehicle miles per day in total and 0.79 miles per bike-share trip on average across the service region on weekdays. The results of this analysis are important in assessing the value of the system. The methodologies developed in this study can be applied in other regions to assess the impact of their bike-share systems.",1361-9209,Not found
En-route fast charging infrastructure planning and scheduling for battery electric bus systems,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103659,117,2023-04-01,2023,4,"The recent advancements toward fast charging technology enable electric buses to be re-charged at bus stops during passengers’ boarding and alighting times. The costs of en-route charging can be substantially reduced through facility sharing among buses from multiple lines, which may, however, result in charging conflicts. This study investigates the charging infrastructure planning and scheduling for a battery electric bus (BEB) system, considering en-route charging and charging conflict avoidance. We introduced a station-based discrete-event approach to discretize the BEB operation system for an entire day. Subsequently, two models were established to determine the charging scheduling and infrastructure planning, which are further reformulated as linear mixed-integer programs. Dwelling times with- and without potential charging conflicts were distinguished in advance and processed separately to reduce the scale of the problem. Numerical examples demonstrated that the proposed models could be solved efficiently in a large BEB system, and cost-effective en-route charging is achievable.",1361-9209,Not found
Emissions from railways: Results of tests on a pantograph-catenary test bench,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103667,117,2023-04-01,2023,4,"Many railway tracks have been electrified, thus eliminating exhaust emissions. However, railways still emit particles due to abrasion and wear. The main such particle sources are brakes, wheel-rail contact, and pantographs and contact wire. However, information on the quantities of such particles is rare. Estimations in published data are quite heterogeneous, with PM10 emission levels varying by a factor of ten. In an attempt to improve the database and to reduce uncertainties, a series of test bench tests was conducted on pantograph-catenary contact. In order to study the impact of specific parameters, i.e. of train speed, contact force and current intensity, on the emitted particle mass and size distribution, parameter levels were varied across the tests. A chemical analysis of emitted particles provided information on the respective contributions of contact strip and contact wire. PM10 emission factors were found to lie in the range of 0.14–0.62 g/km.",1361-9209,Not found
Minimising emissions from flights through realistic wind fields with varying aircraft weights,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103660,117,2023-04-01,2023,4,"The international aviation community has agreed to advance actions to reduce CO 2 emissions. Adopting more fuel-efficient routes will achieve this goal quickly and economically. Full satellite coverage of transatlantic flight routes is now a reality, allowing us to consider moving from the Organised Track Structure to Trajectory-Based Operations. Here, fuel-optimal trajectories through wind fields from a global atmospheric re-analysis dataset are found using dynamic programming. The control variables of aircraft headings and airspeeds are varied to find free-time, fuel-minimal routes. Aircraft fuel consumption is modelled with a new model-specific fuel-burn function, which incorporates aircraft mass reductions as fuel is burned. From 1 December 2019 to 29 February 2020, fuel use from simulated routes is compared with fuel estimates based on recorded flight data. Results demonstrate that an average fuel reduction of 4.2% is possible without significant changes to flight duration. This equates to a reduction of 16.6 million kg of CO 2 emissions. Therefore, free-time, fuel-minimal routes have the potential to offer substantial fuel and emissions savings.",1361-9209,Not found

The objective of the model is to minimize both operator cost and passenger cost. A genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the model and generate the quasi-optimal results, including the required fleet size, vehicle trip chains, charging decisions, and stopping and stop-skipping plans. A case study of a real-world bus line in the city of Dandong, China, is conducted.

The impact of grid mix, diesel & charging prices, and battery energy density was explored by scenario analysis. The sensitivity of driving distances from 100 km to 800 km was determined. It was found that hybrid electric trucks with high hybridization factors perform best. In the future, plug-in hybrid electric trucks with large batteries will perform best over short distances. Conversely, plug-in hybrid electric trucks with small batteries will be the best for medium and long distances.

In this paper, several long-distance routes between the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape in South Africa are assessed for electrification. To mitigate the long charging time of eMBTs, we propose a battery swapping approach in which a trailer acts as a mobile battery bank to the vehicle (eMBT+T); which is to be charged from a solar charging station to reduce emissions. Compared to the current MBTs, the proposed model results in only a 6% trip time increase. Crucially, emissions are reduced by 75%, where a 20% increase is seen when using an eMBT.

The results were investigated in terms of multiple combinations of manufacturing and end-of-life scenarios by encompassing impacts embedded in the global supply chains taking Qatar as a case applied to the proposed model. The Interval-Valued Neutrosophic Fuzzy (IVNF)-Analytic Hierarchy Process with the Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) approach is used to rank the alternative fuel buses based on their corresponding sustainability performance.

Using data from the 2001, 2009, and 2017 National Household Travel Surveys, this study examines the spatiotemporal differences in the use of active travel among three socioeconomic groups classified based on household income and vehicle ownership. After controlling for a number of observed and unobserved factors, we find that individuals in low-income, car-owning households are associated with up to 14% more walking trips and 33% more cycling trips in a week compared to higher-income households, on average. However, in urban areas, higher-income households use active travel significantly more than low-income, car-owning households, while the opposite holds for suburban and rural areas. Individuals living in low-income, carless households are associated with even higher use of active travel. These results suggest that active travel is used, to some extent, out of necessity and lack of other viable options.",1361-9209,Not found

Although BEBs offer quieter operations, better acceleration, and no smell of diesel or gas fumes, little focus has been placed on the user’s perspective. This study investigates bus riders’ preferences toward BEBs. To achieve these objectives, a survey was designed and administered to solicit riders’ typical travel behaviors and patterns as well as preferences and opinions about BEBs’ performance in terms of emissions and noise. Statistical analysis showed that several factors influence rider perceptions towards transit bus electrification that include trip purpose, attitudes towards environmental issues and environmental impacts of BEBs, and certain non-instrumental ride factors such as ride comfort and social image. A better understanding of the importance of electrification to transit riders can help transit service providers adjust their marketing decisions and their systemwide operations to accommodate preferences towards BEBs.",1361-9209,Not found

Policies for electrification of cars in the short and long run,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103606,117,2023-04-01,2023,4,"We study the optimal combination of short and long-lived options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, using electrification of the car fleet as an example. A transition to electric vehicles (EVs) can be incentivized by subsidies on purchases of EVs or on fast chargers. Subsidizing purchases only leads to emissions reductions in the next few years (short-lived static option), whereas investment in fast chargers will reduce abatement costs in several years (long-lived dynamic option). The dynamic option may be socially profitable even if it is more expensive. Numerical simulations confirm the qualitative results of the theory model and point to subsidizing charging stations as the dominate policy. An international permit market affects the combination of static and dynamic abatement. The optimal number of EVs increases with future permit prices, thus making both EV subsides and charging station subsidies more profitable, but it is relatively more cost-efficient to subsidize charging stations.",1361-9209,Not found

The stated preference for combined use of shared e-scooters and transit (“scoot-N-ride”) is stronger among non-White respondents, but it does not differ by gender, age, income, or education. Moreover, we find that “e-scooter + transit” bundled pricing can effectively promote scoot-N-ride. Finally, while survey respondents intend to use shared e-scooters for short trips only, they are willing to use scoot-N-ride for medium-to-long trips.

Based on their daily travel intensity, the EVs are clustered into two groups used primarily for private and commercial purposes. We leverage the data to uncover how, when, and where users in each group charge their EVs; investigate EVs’ energy consumption efficiency and its relationship to charging; and discuss EV-related policy implications.

Using adaptive Lasso and weighted quantile regressions, the key drivers of prices are performance and size, with the effect growing stronger with prices. More specifically, one standard deviation increase of engine power and weight increases prices by 16.9% and 14.7% respectively. AFVs display a significantly greater sensitivity to changes in car characteristics compared to CVs, especially to changes in performance, emissions, and equipment.

N-shaped relationship between economic growth and automotive emissions: Evidence from Russia,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103734,118,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The paper contributes to the literature on the Environmental Kuznets Curve providing an empirical analysis of the relationship between air pollutant emissions from motor vehicles and social and economic factors in 56 major Russian cities using a panel data set for 2013–2018. The fixed effect regression models were used to analyze the impact of gross municipal product per capita on various types of automobile emissions. We found the evidence of an N-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve relationship: emissions rise with economic growth due to the rapid automobilization, thereafter growth slows down, giving way to a decline. The reason may be that the households and commercial organizations in wealthier cities can buy newer cars, which correspondingly meet modern ecological standards and require cleaner fuel. Then, beyond a certain point of the gross municipal product per capita, the growth of automobile emissions resumes. We argue that the further decline is due to the structural economic dynamics and technological shifts, and the second ascending part is because the scale effect outperforms all the others. Other substantial results are as follows: (i) population densification leads to increased automobile pollution in large cities, whereas in relatively small municipalities, the effect is opposite; (iii) roads density is a significant factor of emission reduction in large cities; (iv) increase in the cost of gasoline leads to less vehicular emission. Our results emphasize that Russian cities need massive investments in transport infrastructure to form a new settlement framework outside the established centers. This will not only significantly affect the problem of atmospheric air pollution, but also improve the overall quality of life.

This study investigates a static green bike-repositioning problem with heavy and light carriers (e.g., bike trailers), aiming at minimizing the total cost, including the expected penalty costs for user dissatisfaction, internal variable costs (operating cost and fuel cost), and the external cost. Mixed-integer linear programs are presented with different objectives simulating the goals of public and private operators, respectively. The results show that incorporating light carriers into the repositioning fleet can reduce both the total cost and fuel consumption compared to using heavy carriers solely under the following circumstances: 1) the unit penalty cost, the average nodal distance, and the average absolute deviation are low to moderate; 2) some stations are hard to access for heavy carriers; 3) the traffic on the main roads is congested. The result also illustrates that by charging private operators a high cost on emissions, using more light carriers can be beneficial in reducing both the total cost and the fuel consumption, but user satisfaction and profits for the private operators are sacrificed. This implies that a subsidy to the private operators may be called for if environmental considerations are imposed on their repositioning decisions.",1361-9209,Not found

We show that, compared to using measured mobility data, the current simulation approach overestimates energy expenditure. Results show a mean energy expenditure per distance overestimation of 14%, and mean energy per trip overestimation of 46%. We identify and virtualisation errors in the current driver and infrastructure models, and identify shortcomings of imposing a virtual road network with simulation software in the SSA context. We recommend and demonstrate virtualisation improvements for accurate electro-mobility planning in future.",1361-9209,Not found
Cost-effective electric bus resource assignment based on optimized charging and decision robustness,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103724,118,2023-05-01,2023,5,"This paper explores a cost-efficient resource assignment for urban battery-electric-buses (BEBs) considering decision robustness based on the optimized charging plan. A network flow model was proposed to minimize the operation cost with mixed fleet, nonlinear charging and the constraint of charging station capacity. A sensitivity analysis was implemented using samples generated from clustered real-world data to simulate traffic-dependent bus travel time and energy consumption. The result shows that charging at night or with short duration in the daytime significantly increases the operation cost. Sufficient charging resources improve the robustness of the charging plan, while economic benefits merely increase when the charging station capacity reaches a certain threshold. Bus operators can reduce the investment in chargers to ensure both economic benefits and operation stability. When bus routes are longer with higher energy consumption, buses with medium or high battery capacity become more demanding, while the requirement on charging resources remains stable.",1361-9209,Not found
Socio-economic assessment of shared e-scooters: do the benefits overcome the externalities?,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103714,118,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Shared e-scooters are a trending mobility service and are usually advertised as a sustainable transport mode which could improve urban transport. However, there are concerns regarding their overall impacts. This research conducts a socio-economic assessment of shared e-scooters, considering environmental (emissions and pollutants), social (physical activity, road safety and pollution exposure), and economic (vehicle operating costs and time savings) dimensions. Therefore, we used data from 1.4 million trips from a e-scooter operator in Lisbon and a user survey with 919 responses. Results show that while shared e-scooters do generate benefits, these are highly overshadowed by their safety issues (almost €6M in annual costs). Authorities and organizations should join efforts to improve shared e-scooters’ safety and maximize its benefits. To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the socio-economic impacts of shared e-scooters, so the limitations of the used methods are identified and can be improved in future research.",1361-9209,Not found
On the inconsistency and revision of Carbon Intensity Indicator for cruise ships,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103662,118,2023-05-01,2023,5,"The Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) is one of the major instruments to assess the CO2 emissions coming from ship operations. Thus, it has a strong impact on the decisions taken by cruise companies regarding fleet allocation and itineraries planning. Although the CII works well with cargo vessels, it leads to misleading results when applied to cruise ships since the hotel load of a cruise ship is comparable to propulsion power. This leads to an inconsistency between emissions and CII values, which foster the adoption of itineraries having a higher environmental footprint. Here, a data-driven correction of the CII for cruise ships is proposed to remove the dependence of CII from the time at port/at sea. The correction is determined using a database relating to operative and forecasted emissions of a large fleet of cruise ships. The application to a medium-size cruise ship proves the potential of the proposed methodology.",1361-9209,Not found

We compare these motives regarding consumer choice of electric and shared mobility, using survey data from a sample of Canadian adopters and non-adopters of electric vehicles, car-sharing and shared ride-hailing (n = 529). Our framework includes four perception categories: private-functional (e.g., costs and convenience), private-symbolic (e.g., making good impressions), societal-functional (e.g., protecting the environment) and societal-symbolic (e.g., spreading inspiration). We apply two data analytic approaches, finding that positive private-functional perceptions are consistently associated with adoption across all three innovations, especially convenience and compatibility. Other patterns vary by innovation. Most notably, positive private-symbolic considerations are significantly associated with electric vehicle adoption. Results suggest that while functional considerations are important, symbolic motives can also be important but with more nuance.",1361-9209,Not found
Influence of travel time on carbon dioxide emissions from urban traffic,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103698,118,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Carbon footprint analysis measures the greenhouse gas emissions from the mobilization of members of an institution. Commonly, the product between the distance and economy fuel rate is used to estimate fuel consumption and, thus, carbon dioxide emission (CO2). However, the distance is a constant variable in a specific route, generating constant values of fuel consumption. We analyzed the influence at the local level of the time variable in the fuel consumption by each leg of an entire route and the type of vehicle used. The results showed that in intense traffic conditions, the consumed fuel was 1.1–1.5 times more than normal. The proposed approach presented similar results to previous studies with real-world carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, using a multivariate regression model, the relationship between CO2 emitted with time disaggregated by the leg and by the type of vehicle was found to be linear, significant, and highly correlated.",1361-9209,Not found

Planners often assess the typical walkability framework from a geographic perspective based on GIS data. This paper proposes a refined walkability framework that quantifies walkability in terms of four pedestrian needs: safety, convenience, continuity, and attractiveness. Using Shenzhen as our case study, we integrate mesoscale and microscale built-environment features from different data sources: street view images (SVIs), social media, points-of-interest data, government open data, and GIS data. Deep learning semantic segmentation approaches apply to extracting street elements from SVIs. Results show that walkability and its four aspects are spatially heterogeneous in the city. Urban areas and suburban central business districts offer greater walkability than other areas. The less walkable areas are mainly in the rest of the suburbs. This work suggests that more academic and planning efforts should focus on improving walkability in less walkable neighborhoods and promoting pedestrian-friendly cities.",1361-9209,Not found
On ride-sourcing services of electric vehicles considering cruising for charging and parking,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103716,118,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Cruising of electric ride-sourcing vehicles (ERVs) when waiting for trip orders can create additional vehicle miles, which increase congestion and waste electricity. Reducing cruising is an important issue. This study investigates the strategy of allocating a portion of road space as parking for ERVs. Considering ERVs cruising for parking/charging, we analytically examine the trade-off between road capacity reduction due to reserving road space as parking and less cruising. We evaluate the effects of parking provision on reducing congestion and charging demand. We also investigate the optimal fare and fleet size of ERV services to achieve profit or social welfare maximization. Numerical studies indicate that vehicles cruising for charging might be reduced significantly with a mild increase of charging pile supply, where cruising can increase sharply after charging pile occupancy rate is at critical levels. By providing parking to ERVs, ride-sourcing demand increases, charging demand reduces, profit and social welfare increase.",1361-9209,Not found

Therefore, this paper explores the pricing and advertising strategies of CV (conventional vehicle) and AFV retailers when considering different advertising formats, namely, informative and persuasive, within a competitive market. We compare the profits of the two competitive retailers to arrive at the optimal decisions, as well as the investment levels of advertising. In addition to the effectiveness of the two stated advertising strategies, we derive some practical and counterintuitive results where for instance, the optimal price of the AFV retailer is positively correlated with the utility of the two types of advertising. Additionally, investment advertising does not necessarily bring benefits to AFV retailers.

Three case studies are introduced illustrating the potential of the methodology: a reference case with a dynamic traffic flow, the correlation between vehicle-specific NECs and average speeds, and vehicle-specific NECs in a mixed traffic fleet. The results highlight the interest and importance of using a microscopic approach, as the impact of interactions, vehicle-specific characteristics and behaviors are reflected into the associated NECs.

We relate them to four EV sales scenarios towards 2035 in the UC Davis Transportation Transition Model, with different EV shares of total light-duty vehicle sales. In each scenario, we estimate production capacities and investments needed. By comparing announced capacities to EV sales targets, we find that in the most ambitious scenario where US achieves 66% EV sales by 2030, the planned 5.1-million EV production falls short by over half; with tentative plans included, the gap closes to 4.6 million. In a less rapid scenario (40% by 2030), tentative plans are sufficient.

Achieving reliable coordination of residential plug-in electric vehicle charging: A pilot study,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103658,118,2023-05-01,2023,5,"We report findings from a real-world pilot study exploring a novel pricing and control mechanism to coordinate residential EV charging loads. The proposed pricing mechanism presents EV owners with a “menu of deadlines” that offers lower electricity prices the longer they are willing to delay their charging completion times. Given customers’ reported charging preferences, a smart charging system dynamically optimizes the power drawn by EVs in real-time to minimize their collective strain on the grid while ensuring all EVs are charged by their user-requested deadlines. We find that customers allow their charging to be delayed by over eight hours on average. Using this flexibility, the smart charging system reliably eliminates demand spikes by reshaping EV loads to flatten the aggregate load curve. Importantly, customer participation rates remained stable throughout the study, providing evidence that the proposed mechanism is a viable “non-wires alternative” to meet the growing demand for electricity from EVs.",1361-9209,Not found

High fidelity estimates of paratransit energy consumption from per-second GPS tracking data,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103695,118,2023-05-01,2023,5,"Paratransit, in particular the minibus taxi, is the mainstay of public transport in sub-Saharan Africa. These vehicles are often second-hand, ageing, fuel inefficient, and expensive to operate - issues that electrification can ameliorate. However, modeling and planning large-scale transitions to electric paratransit require reliable estimates of vehicle energy consumption. This paper provides such estimates by applying a vehicle kinetic model to per-second GPS data gathered on minibus taxis. Data include 62 trips across three routes with different driving conditions near Stellenbosch, South Africa. We find a range of energy consumption from 0.29 to 0.51 kWh/km (mean = 0.39 kWh/km). Past estimates in literature relied on per-minute GPS data, which we show leads to inaccurate energy consumption estimates.

We use a technology adoption model which includes consumer preferences and endogenous learning, while also representing automaker decisions. In scenarios where AVs become fully available for sale in 2025, consumer uptake ranges from 15% to 36% new market share by 2035--some of which displace ZEV sales. With or without strong climate policy, the availability of AVs leads to a small increase in GHG emissions, largely due to increased VKT per vehicle and among new user groups.

The framework was tested for Austin, Texas, using an agent-based simulator. Fleets can schedule charging to lower daily power costs (averaging 15.5% or $0.79/day/SAEV) while reducing health damages from generation-related pollution (2.8% or $0.43/day/SAEV).

Micro-trips were extracted using a Python-based clustering algorithm. The results indicate that the acceleration and deceleration decreased as the negative slope decreased. Drivers tended to use sharper acceleration and deceleration on uphill and downhill roads, while the lowest values of kinematic parameter values were obtained for roads with grades ranging from −2 to 2; therefore, cities with road slope values beyond this range should consider sloped roads during the development of driving cycle. Furthermore, research on CO, HC and NOx emissions related to slopes shows that for the emissions, they are more sensitive to increase from flat to uphill with respect to increasing in downhill to flat sections.",1361-9209,Not found

For maritime transport, the goal is a 50 % reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This may be achieved using low and zero-emission fuels. LNG is a well-known low-carbon fuel for some ship types, but for application to medium to small-sized vessels, more cost-effective, compact, and operational robust solutions must be available. This paper discusses patented LNG fuel system designs and gives a qualitative evaluation of them with respect to their application to this ship segment. The use of a pressure build-up unit in combination with nitrogen injection, and/or heating of the LNG during bunkering, is suggested to be a feasible solution. Another aim of this paper is to highlight the role of patents within this area and contribute to the prevention of patent infringement.",1361-9209,Not found

This paper contributes by addressing how travel satisfaction, neighborhood satisfaction, and social capital relate to life satisfaction among a low-income community in Bogotá (Colombia) as a case study. Building on the available literature, we propose six hypotheses to understand such relationships before and after a cable car implementation, considering control and treatment groups. We defined seven latent variables and three objective indicators. We tested the hypotheses using a multiple-cause multiple-indicator modeling approach, which allowed us to identify how the comprehensive cable car intervention impacts perceptions and life satisfaction. Results showed that the principal factors associated with life satisfaction were neighborhood satisfaction as well as leisure activity participation, while travel time and transport affordability had negative effects. Positive changes in satisfaction regarding the travel experience can trigger significant improvements in life satisfaction in low-income communities in Latin America.",1361-9209,Not found
Delineating race-specific driving patterns for identifying racial segregation,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103769,119,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Transportation equity is a substantial concern for planners. Segregation and exposure analysis provide a lens from which community stakeholders can better decipher transportation equity challenges. This paper aims to expand racial segregation analysis beyond residential places to a more holistic activity space, including commuter populations. We filled existing research gaps on validity by calibrating Information Maximization (IM) model and a distance decay function to estimate race-specific driving patterns iteratively. A unique index of intergroup exposure and potential for contact between residents, workers, and commuters is proposed to understand the varying exposures different racial groups have with each other. We further identified the most racially-segregated road segments, residential and workplace areas, and how they become segregated based on the commuters' information. Given that exposure is a precursor to contact, understanding race-specific driving patterns is vital to understanding more extensive social mobility and segregation processes and their consequences for transport equity.",1361-9209,Not found
Residential relocation as a key event in commuting mode shift,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103772,119,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Residential self-selection studies argue that pre-existing travel-related attitude overshadows the role of changes in residential built environment in (re)shaping travel behaviours. Our study contributes to this self-selection argument by including family- and job-related life events as another self-selection source, and accounting for the reverse causality from built environment to travel attitude as opposed to the attitude-induced self-selection. Using a two-wave sample of 1,038 Dutch residents before and after the relocation, we developed structural equation models to investigate longitudinal relationships between changes in residential built environment and job-housing distances, the occurrence of life events, and changes in commuting mode choices and preferences pre-post relocation. Results supported residential self-selection arising from pre-existing preferences for car and public transport commuting, while residents lowered the active commuting preference after moving to a more suburban neighbourhood. Life events concurrent with residential relocation, such as childbirth and job changes, also underlay greater demand for car use.",1361-9209,Not found

A solar-powered bus charging infrastructure location problem under charging service degradation,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103770,119,2023-06-01,2023,6,Photovoltaic and energy storage system (PESS) offers a compelling pathway towards boosting green transportation due to its low carbon emissions. This study investigates a solar-powered bus charging infrastructure location problem by considering PESS. A two-stage robust optimization model is formulated to handle the uncertainty of charging service degradation. The first-stage decision is to determine which bus depots are to be upgraded with PESS. The second-stage decision is to conduct emergent bus and energy scheduling when the charging service degrades. Two objectives are optimized simultaneously. The first objective is to maximize the net benefits of PESS during day-to-day operations. The second objective is to minimize the unmet passenger demands during the charging service degradation. We implement a case study using a sub-network of Beijing public transport. The results present pieces of evidence that PESS can lower the daily bus charging costs and improve the service capacity of passengers when the charging service degrades.,1361-9209,Not found
Investigating the deployment of initial public charging infrastructure: Planning-based VS market-based approaches,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103755,119,2023-06-01,2023,6,"An efficient planning of public charging infrastructure is crucial for the uptake of electric vehicles, which requires not only the cost-effectiveness of charging infrastructure construction, but also the effects in accelerating the process of EV promotion. However, the existing studies on the layout of public charging facilities have rarely taken both of these aspects into account. This study aimed to enrich the available literature by evaluating planning-based versus market-based approaches to installing charging piles and optimizing the scheme for initially deploying public charging infrastructure. An agent-based model that integrated the individual heterogeneity of manufacturers and consumers was constructed, with parameter settings that were defined based on the Chinese market. The impact of the initial deployment of public charging piles was compared in terms of planning-based and market-based strategies. The main results indicated a significantly positive effect of public charging piles construction. The market share of passenger EVs at 2040 could increase from 23.58% to 39.38% at most compared to the baseline scenario. Among the two approaches to deploying charging piles, the planning-based strategy proved superior in cultivating a niche market; however, the market-based approach was more cost-efficient from the perspective of long-term market cultivation, allowing savings of up to 14.2% of the investment costs.

We proposes an index of isolation vulnerability as a new metric for network vulnerability analysis. Isolation vulnerability covers the situation in which supporting bases and receiving bases in a network cannot connect when some links are degraded due to external forces imposed on the network. Isolation vulnerability is derived as a solution of the maximum flow problem for a one-to-one network extended for supporting bases and receiving bases. A single set of link combinations does not necessarily exist that defines an isolation vulnerability, i.e., a set that is isolation-critical.

The construction sector is responsible for 26.40% of truck traffic in the BCR. This paper examines the exposure effects when off-site construction logistics flows are redirected around air pollution hotspots. Consequently, alternative routing scenarios are computed, and its emission dispersed assuming a Gaussian relation. Concentrations are then associated to spatiotemporal receptor densities. The health impact is monetized using hospital exposure-response functions. While overall emissions increase across all scenarios, health costs are mitigated up to 25.53% by rerouting existing flows. This study suggests to decouple policies from absolute transport emissions and focus on its health impact, considering spatiotemporal dynamics of both emissions and receptors.",1361-9209,Not found

Further, we developed a series of deep learning methods to predict the EV battery swapping demand, particularly considering temporal demand patterns obtained from the dataset. The deep learning models were Long Short-Term Memory, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Units, and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units.

However, slowdown in fleet updates existed for most of aircraft types, and the decreased fleet fuel intensity only resulted in CO2 emission reduction in specific years. The rising air transport demand continues to be the greatest obstacle to reducing emissions. Under the baseline scenario, aviation carbon intensity can only realize the 60–65% target by 2035. With endeavours on traffic demand control and technology, aviation CO2 emissions will peak at 123 Mt in 2035.

Strategies of stakeholders’ selection of shore-to-ship power in China,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103729,119,2023-06-01,2023,6,"In the context of the global energy crisis and environmental degradation, ports are not only important hubs connecting water and land transportation but also major sources of energy consumption and environmental pollution. How to promote the transformation of ports to green and achieve sustainable development of ports has become the focus of attention in the world. As a major shipping country in the world, China attaches great importance to the issue of air pollutant emissions in port areas and has issued a series of policies on shore-to-ship power in recent years, but due to the lack of endogenous market dynamics, port, and shipping enterprises are not willing to use shore power, and the development of shore power technology is severely restricted. In the research of shore-to-ship power propulsion countermeasures, the existing methods mostly target a single subject and are mostly limited to a static perspective, focusing more on qualitative analysis, while lacking the idea of system modeling. Based on the interactions of the stakeholders involved in the promotion of shore-to-ship power, a game model of strategic choices of the stakeholders, namely the government, the port enterprise, and the shipping companies, is constructed based on evolutionary game theory. For obtaining the benefits matrix and the expected return of the stakeholders under various choices, the parameters in the game model are given. The stability theorem of differential equations is used to find the equilibriums of the choices’ games, and the stability of each equilibrium is judged. The evolution mechanism of the strategic choices of all the stakeholders for promoting shore-to-ship power is analyzed through system dynamics simulation in Matlab. The results show that the strategic choices of the government, the port enterprise, and the shipping companies affect each other greatly.

Optimal ship lifetime fuel and power system selection under uncertainty,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103748,119,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Ship designers face increasing pressure to comply with global emission reduction ambitions.

We develop a two-stage stochastic optimization model that explicitly considers uncertain fuel and carbon emission prices, as well as potential retrofits along the lifetime. The bi-objective setup of the model shows how the choice of optimal power system changes with reduced emission levels. Methanol and LNG configurations appear to be relatively robust initial choices due to their ability to run on fuel derived from different feedstocks, andtheir better retrofittability towards ammonia or hydrogen.

Provinces that export large amounts of electricity and have high emission intensities bear the burden of emissions due to electricity consumption by EVs in other provinces. Promoting the use of EVs helps reduce NOx nationwide as well as the volumes of GHG and PM2.5 emissions in most provinces of China. Emissions transfer due to EVs clarifies the disadvantages of reducing emissions in provinces that export a large amount of electricity. Therefore, the environmental pressure imposed on electricity exporting regions due to emissions transfer from EVs should be considered when designing related incentive policies.",1361-9209,Not found

The study uses infrastructural and environmental data. Two analyses were performed: clustering by the Gaussian Mixture Model to find group similarities and regressions by weighted least squares (WLS) and the generalized linear models (GLM) to extract factors related to deforestation considering the complete set and the clusters. The results revealed six clusters. Some suffer direct impacts from roads, while others are better preserved. Regression models revealed active fires, illegal mining, and that unofficial roads within ILs to be the drivers for deforestation. The general results indicated that for every 1 km of an additional unofficial route, deforestation increases by 0.036 km2.

Evaluation of plug-in hybrid vehicles in real-world conditions by simulation,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103721,119,2023-06-01,2023,6,"Assessing the real-world energy performance and emissions of Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles (PHEVs) is complex: it depends on their usage (trip distance, recharging behavior), and results in different combined uses of their thermal and electric propulsion. In this study, vehicle simulators were calibrated using experimental data (in-lab and on-road), allowing a comprehensive range of uses spanning vehicle configurations, battery capacity, outside temperature and driving profiles. These results were synthetized through a method weighting each simulated use-case according to their probability, based on statistics of daily distance travelled and temperature. The assessment was made for a wide range of battery capacity and recharging frequency, and provided the real-world share of electric drive, CO2 emissions, fuel and electricity consumptions of PHEVs according to these two key parameters. Finally, in a very likely battery-constrained environment, PHEVs should be fostered to minimize GHG emissions providing that they are recharged at least every-five driving days.",1361-9209,Not found
Wise use of renewable energy in transport,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103713,119,2023-06-01,2023,6,"The transport sector accounts for around 25 % of global energy use, considering both fuel production and consumption. To mitigate climate change, a fast decarbonization of transport is therefore often seen as a necessity, as advocated by the International Energy Agency in its Net Zero by 2050 scenario. In contrast, Shell's Sky scenario envisages Net Zero by 2070 by first picking the lowest hanging fruits within all sectors, and hence a much slower de-carbonization of the transport sector. We investigate how renewables, a scarce resource over the next decades, could be used most wisely within the transport sector or alternatively within the energy sector. Our results stress that priority up to 2050 should be: First, to use new renewable energy to replace coal fired electricity production to nearly decarbonize the electricity grid; Second, to gradually electrify road transport; Third, continued use of fossil fuel in shipping and aviation.",1361-9209,Not found

Our analysis shows that the revenue sharing and linear two-part tariff agreements coordinate the decentralized airport-airline channel. Our findings also reveal that under government interventions, taxation does help improve the greening level of the channel in both coordinating and non-coordinating agreements. However, coordinating agreements can achieve a higher greening level than simply imposing government taxation.

In this work, we propose virtual acoustic terrain, a novel concept to enable an efficient trajectory optimization paradigm. By applying acoustic ray tracing and the principle of reciprocity in a complex urban environment, we convert different noise constraints into 3D exclusion zones which UAM operations should avoid to maintain limited noise impact. It combines with the physical urban terrain to define an acceptable fly zone for non-repetitive noise-aware trajectory optimization.

Pavement-effects on heavy-vehicle fuel consumption in cold climate using a statistical approach,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103792,120,2023-07-01,2023,7,"Policy-makers are investigating ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation sector.

The results of nested logit models show that the tradable permit scheme significantly reduces rush-hour breakfasts by about 20%. These results are robust to controlling for other factors, such as individual, commuting, attitudes, game- and market-related characteristics.

The mathematical formulation of the use stage is done using the continuous approximation methodology. Finally, some managerial insights are obtained. Two-echelon operations would generate between 60 and 130 gCO2-eq per parcel delivery depending on the considered operation scenario. The ADR fleet production and renewal are the biggest contributors to this total global warming potential (GWP).

Considering the recent innovations in machine learning, a tree-boosting algorithm combined with Gaussian process and random effects models (GPBoost) is applied using the big GPS taxi data from Dalian, China. The nonlinear relationships between built environment variables and traffic carbon (CO2) emissions are interpreted using the SHapley Additive ExPlanation (SHAP). It is found that the proposed GPBoost model that considers spatial heterogeneity enhances the overall predictive power compared to traditional machine learning models. Most of the built environment variables have a nonlinear relationship with traffic carbon emissions and the threshold effects vary over time, indicating the necessity of dynamic urban management.",1361-9209,Not found
An integrated slot allocation model for time-space-dimensional noise reduction,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103845,121,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Many airports face challenges with slot scheduling and noise pollution. While previous research has focused on optimizing slot allocation to mitigate noise in the temporal dimension through schedule displacement, little attention has been given to the spatial dimension. This paper expands the environmental benefits analysis of slot allocation from the temporal dimension to the temporal-spatial dimension. To this end, we develop a single-airport bi-objective slot allocation model that considers schedule efficiency and noise reduction through schedule displacement (temporal dimension) and takeoff direction changes (spatial dimension). Then, we compare the efficacy of takeoff direction changes for noise reduction with that of schedule displacement. Additionally, we investigate the effects of takeoff direction changes on schedule displacement. Results show that takeoff direction changes are more effective than schedule displacement for noise abatement at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. Moreover, takeoff direction changes can influence slot displacement allocated to each airline due to fairness considerations.",1361-9209,Not found
Meta-analysis of shared micromobility ridership determinants,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103847,121,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Shared micromobility (SμM)—shared e-scooters and (e-)bikes—offer moderate-speed, space-efficient, and carbon-light mobility, promoting environmental sustainability and healthy travel. SμM benefits and SμM data availability have fueled a growing literature that analyses SμM ridership. We present a meta-analysis of 29 studies that estimate statistical models of zone- or station-based SμM trip counts, including 22 that examine station-based bikeshare systems. The meta-analysis reveals positive elasticities between SμM usage and population density (median elasticity of 0.16), employment density (0.07), median household income (0.33), bus stops (0.12), metro stations (0.17), bike infrastructure (0.09), and nearby station capacity (0.32). In contrast, station elevation has a negative elasticity. These magnitudes can inform SμM providers and transportation planners seeking to plan/design SμM systems to promote environmentally sustainable travel. Additionally, we critique the existing literature’s failure to (i) capture spatial dependencies, and (ii) discuss the practical implications of model parameters.

Data mining from Twitter has enabled this research to obtain a rich alternative source of public sentiments on EVs. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were then used to analyse the evolution in sentiments and reveal the underlying patterns in the discourse on EVs.

"Does mass rapid transit reduce motorcycle travel? Evidence from Taipei, Taiwan",10.1016/j.trd.2023.103844,121,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Motorcycles bring environmental harm. Many cities with high motorcycle ownership rates have been establishing or expanding mass transit. Whether these investments can lure existing motorcycle users is of policy concern. This research is the first to examine mass rapid transit effects on motorcycle travel, using datasets from the most recent 2000 and 2009 large-scale household travel surveys in Taipei, one of the world’s earliest motorcycle-stressed cities to have adopted a metro system. The difference-in-differences method was employed to examine the treatment effects of metro stations on mode choice in trips and household motorcycle vehicle kilometers traveled within their proximity, controlling for built environment and socioeconomic predictors of motorcycle travel. Findings suggest that both newly introduced metro stations and older pre-existing ones were effective in reducing the motorcycle mode choice probability relative to that of the metro for trips originating nearby as well as household motorcycle vehicle kilometers traveled around them.",1361-9209,Not found
Emission reductions from heavy-duty freight electrification aided by smart fleet management,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103846,121,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Companies have made significant progress in decarbonizing product manufacturing, but transportation decarbonization lags as focus area. Battery advancements enable decarbonization in logistics through electric vehicle adoption. Yet, without managed charging, the total potential for freight electrification to reduce carbon emissions remains constrained. Using a route optimization and production reallocation model, this analysis demonstrates how fleet managers could actively reduce carbon emissions by up to 30% based on a Chinese case study. If data are available, the model could be applied to other countries and especially the international supply chains. Optimizing fleet charging in locations with the lowest grid emission factors achieves the greatest emission reductions. Companies seeking to decarbonize their logistics should explore novel fleet charging strategies. Meanwhile, cities with clean electric grids can attract electric vehicle charging and stimulate job growth, further incentivizing decarbonization of public utilities. This initiates a virtuous cycle of business-led emission reductions.",1361-9209,Not found

To optimize its economic, social and ecological impacts, green parcel-delivery interventions are required and must be tested in time and cost-efficient environments. We propose a new, integrated simulation model comprising existing methods such as macroscopic traffic simulation, mode shift model and approximation techniques to assess the three-dimensional impact of green parcel-delivery interventions, namely battery electric vehicles, parcel shops and parcel lockers. We apply the model to a real-world case study in Berlin.

The deployment of the tool prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique natural experiment. A series of tests for internal validity, consistency, and reliability, including confirmatory factor analysis, support two of the proposed travel problem indices (Reliance and Trips Forgone).

Sailing smoothly under Sulphur fuel regulations: The shipping liner's bunkering problem,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103838,121,2023-08-01,2023,8,"This paper addresses the shipping liner’s bunkering problem in response to International Maritime Organization’s low-Sulphur fuel regulations, commonly known as IMO 2020. To minimize bunkering and inventory costs while adopting a slow steaming strategy on the sailing route, we propose a two-stage analytical framework that integrates a game-theoretic model with an optimization model. The framework also considers the uncertainty surrounding low-Sulphur and high-Sulphur fuel oil prices in the port of call decision. Our experimental results demonstrate that, when the prices of low-Sulphur fuel oil (LSFO) and high-Sulphur fuel oil (HFO) increase by 40%, the total cost and bunkering cost increase by 3.88% and 4.77%, respectively. Conversely, a 10% decrease in fuel prices leads to a substantial 9.79% and 10.27% drop in total cost and bunkering cost, respectively. Additionally, the experiments consider the mandatory requirement of LSFO, making the results highly relevant and informative for the liner shipping industry. Moreover, this study provides a comprehensive and insightful approach to address the bunkering problem, facilitating the compliance of the IMO 2020 regulations while minimizing costs for shipping liners.",1361-9209,Not found

A resilience assessment model considering the rainfall intensity and its spatiotemporal distribution was used. A numerical experiment was conducted on the HRC network in Fujian Province, China, and the results indicate that the HRC network is more resilient to rainstorms than the highway and railway networks. A nonlinear positive correlation is observed between the network's resilience and rainfall intensity. Rainstorms from March to September severely affect the resilience of the network, particularly in June, August, and September of each year.

We consider an on-demand taxi-ridesharing system, where the focus lies on the anticipatory assignment of customers to meeting points. We model the problem as a sequential decision process with the objective to maximize the distance saved through sharing. We suggest an anticipatory solution method for the planning of trips which assigns passengers to meeting points. We evaluate the suggested method on instances arising from real-world data and show that it leads to a significant increase in saved distance, and consequently CO 2 emissions when compared to a benchmark.

Robust design of CAV-Dedicated lanes considering CAV demand uncertainty and lane reallocation policy,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103827,121,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Reduced headways of connected and automated vehicles (CAV) provide opportunities to address traffic congestion and environmental adversities.

The upper level determines the links (and number of lanes) for CAVDL deployment to minimize emissions. It considers lane reallocation policies that account for the prospect of smaller width of CAV-dedicated lane due to the smaller lateral wander of CAV tire tracks. This can increase the total number of lanes on wide highway sections. At the lower level, equilibrium and demand diffusion models capture travelers’ route and vehicle-type choices.

Results showed that the autorickshaws' fuel consumption (3.18 L/100 km) and CO2 emissions (79 CO2 g/km) are smaller than the most efficient commercial gasoline-fueled light-duty vehicle. This result is due to small engine size (∼10 HP) and reduced curb vehicular weight (337 kg).

Evaluating the travel impacts of a shared mobility system for remote workers,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103798,121,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Given the rapid rise of remote work, there is an opportunity for new shared mobility services designed to meet the needs of passengers with multiple possible work locations. This paper develops a new optimization model to enable shared mobility systems to match drivers and passengers when passengers have flexible destinations. Constraints representing employer policies, such as mandatory co-location of colleagues and limited capacity of satellite offices are introduced in order to explore the impact of employer remote work policies on travel demand. A case study using historical demand data demonstrates that incorporating flexible work locations can increase ride-pooling participation by up to 6.7% and reduce vehicle-kilometers traveled by 4.9%. Outcomes are found to be significantly affected by employer policies. The implications of the results for shared mobility business models, employer remote work plans and local transportation policy are discussed.",1361-9209,Not found
Subsidy policy and carbon quota mechanism of the Chinese vehicle industry,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103806,121,2023-08-01,2023,8,"The development of BEVs (battery electric vehicles) can significantly mitigate the dependence on fossil fuels and reduce carbon emissions. To advance the development of BEVs, China is adjusting the subsidy and dual-credit policies. This paper addresses these two issues to help policymakers determine effective policies. Through the simulation with a system dynamics model that incorporates the government, automakers, infrastructure operators, and consumers, we find that (1) reducing the overall level of subsidies has a minor impact on the development of BEVs in the long term; (2) subsiding the construction of infrastructure, especially battery swapping stations, will produce better effects than others; (3) the proposed carbon quota mechanism, which is in line with the unified carbon market, is more conducive to the diffusion of BEVs and carbon reduction than the dual-credit policy. Our MLP-SD (multi-level perspective system dynamics) model broadens the analytical perspective of the technology transition in the automobile industry.",1361-9209,Not found

However, academic research on maritime social sustainability is still limited. This study provides a comprehensive conceptualization of maritime social responsibility and investigates whether the flag of the vessel, impacts this conceptualization. Using data from many seafarers globally, the present study empirically confirms and validates that maritime social responsibility is a multidimensional construct, consisting of (i) physical, (ii) functional, (iii) healthy, (iv) cultural, and (v) communication components. Findings show that seafarers’ perceptions do not differ based on the flag of the vessel of their employment.

Comparison of deterministic and ensemble weather forecasts on ship sailing speed optimization,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103801,121,2023-08-01,2023,8,"Ship sailing speed optimization models are constructed based on prediction of ship fuel consumption, whose accuracy is highly influenced by the quality of sea and weather information. In this study, we develop two fusion methods for combining external meteorological data with ship noon report data, including the rhumb line based fusion method and the direct fusion method, and compare them in terms of accuracy in providing meteorological data. Next, we propose a framework based on the better data fusion strategy for comparing the impacts of deterministic and ensemble weather forecasts on ship speed optimization performance, enabling the evaluation of ship fuel consumptions under different speed plans based on weather forecast data available before departure. Results show that speed optimization based on ensemble weather forecasts has greater potential than that based on deterministic weather forecasts to diminish ship fuel consumption and thus to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",1361-9209,Not found

This paper presents a system dynamics model to evaluate the effects that policies associated with EV adoption have on sustainability indicators, as well as on the vehicle and energy supply chains in Colombia. The main findings show that the proposed fiscal measures do not achieve massification in the medium term and that the capacity of the energy system may be a limiting factor in the adoption process. Systemic policy evaluation identifies problems that may emerge in their implementation, such as limiting factors and that policy efforts are not leverage points. It would, therefore, allow for better strategies to be formulated.",1361-9209,Not found

Thus, climate resilience and sustainable adaptation of infrastructure are of paramount importance. This paper puts forward a novel framework and metrics for optimising sustainability (Greenhouse Gas emissions - GHG), climate resilience (restoration time), and cost. The framework aims to facilitate decision-making by operators and stakeholders and communicate actionable trade-offs between these principles. It describes approaches for quantifying ex-ante adaptation and ex-post recovery from the lenses of sustainability and resilience using relevant metrics. This paper concludes with an application of the framework on a bridge, where normalised metrics are integrated into one unique index (ISRC), which can be used in the recovery prioritisation for portfolios of similar assets. The optimisation program includes a bridge recovery, while reducing GHG emissions. The impact of climate change on the sustainability and resilience indexes is examined and the results show how the optimum solutions are adversely affected by different climate projections. In all scenarios examined, more sustainable solutions leading to reduced GHG emissions (tCO2e) are the optimum solutions when weighing resilience and cost. Based on the case study analysed in this paper, the low carbon restoration strategy resulted in up to 50% higher ISRC, which can justify investments for low GHG adaptation strategies in transport assets.",1361-9209,Not found

One approach is to promote zero emission vehicles which can offer rapid and effective outcomes. Accordingly, exclusive lanes for zero emission vehicles on expressways have been pursued as a measure that can be implemented immediately with minimal detrimental impacts. To assess their economic viability, this study developed a methodological framework with a benefit-cost ratio for zero emission vehicle exclusive lanes, taking multiple traffic factors into account. Along with travel time savings, a safety performance function was proposed for traffic accident probability. A case study using diverse traffic datasets from the Republic of Korea revealed greater benefits from travel time savings than costs from congestion and accidents in all scenarios.

Equity analysis and improvement in transportation resilience optimisation at the pre-event stage,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103892,122,2023-09-01,2023,9,"It is broadly accepted that transportation planning models must evolve to consider equity and fairness in their role of supporting the design of society's future mobility, as a lack of equity or fairness can directly impact residents’ social wellbeing. However, social equity is seldom considered in resilience-related improvement that is crucial for transport networks to protect against recurring natural and man-made disasters. In addition, there is no single universally accepted definition for equity/fairness which, as a result, significantly complicates quantification. Therefore, this research identifies multiple frameworks for the quantification of model-amenable metrics so that each of the identified potential approaches can be further examined and trade-offs considered. Results suggest that differences in inequity reduction are observed among different equity mechanisms for a given level of investment.

Detection probability of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was impacted by multiple driver, animal, and roadside factors. Deer detection distances increased by 20.99 m when drivers used high-beam headlights and 23.36 m when deer were moving but decreased by 0.71 m for every minute into a drive.

We propose a tractable queuing-theoretic solution method to determine three optimal planning factors: charging infrastructure, fleet size, and battery capacity. We demonstrate the proposed method in a numerical example and derive the following practical insights. First, sharing chargers among BEBs assigned to different routes is beneficial, but pooling BEB fleets does not always guarantee economic and environmental benefits. Second, the optimal BEB system, while not the most economically preferable option, provides the maximum environmental benefit compared to conventional non-fully-electrified systems.

Therefore, we assess the social costs of a decarbonized ground-based passenger transport system in 2040, covering vehicle costs, costs for externalities and travel time costs across travel modes. Our results show that social costs decline with the introduction of decarbonization strategies. Specific effects include a reduction of vehicle costs and external costs, a rise in external benefits due to positive health effects of active mobility that overcompensate remaining external costs, and possibly increased travel time costs.",1361-9209,Not found

It introduces a method to calculate on-road truck emissions considering different trip purposes and the shift in load states between purposes. Results indicate that the real-world emissions from heavy-duty diesel trucks vary significantly by trip purpose, with the highest variations in the emission factors for NOX and PM2.5 exceeding 21.06% and 14.24%, respectively.

This study examined the effects of income per population, relative improvements in road mobility over road accessibility (MOA) and income inequality on the MTC ownership ratio under different levels of urbanization. A panel of 53 nations from 1963 to 2013 was analyzed using fixed-effects panel linear regression. The inverse U-shaped relationship between the MTC ownership ratio and income changes to a U-shaped relationship as urbanization rises. The growing rate of the MTC ownership ratio and the turning point for the inverse U-shaped relationship between the ratio and income inequality both rise along with urbanization. The negative effect of MOA on the ownership ratio of MTC is lessened by urbanization.",1361-9209,Not found
Truck transportation in California: Disaggregating public health costs from criteria pollutants,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103850,122,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Freight transportation is a significant source of emissions and public health (PH) externalities. This study estimates PH cost intensities of PM2.5 (and precursors) from freight transportation in California for stratified freight movements using the California Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey, the Emission Factor model, and the Human Exposure Model Estimating Air pollution Social Impact Using Regression model. These data are combined to perform clustering, multiple linear regression (MLR), and stratified cost and spatial analyses. The clustering analysis identifies six groups of vehicle type and operational characteristics, with the mean cost per vehicle ranging from 57.6 (for short-haul, gasoline-fueled trucks) to $2,066 (for long-haul traveling mostly in California). The MLR finds that vehicle age, typical trip distances, fuel types, home-base location, and gross vehicle weight significantly impact a vehicle's PH costs. These findings can inform targeted planning, such as prioritizing vehicle technology incentives and other mitigation efforts related to freight externalities.",1361-9209,Not found

This paper focuses on the association between street-level green space exposure around subway stations at residential and work locations and people’s choice of subway as their primary commuting mode and travel satisfaction, using street view data and survey data in Beijing, China. Street view data and a machine learning approach were used to measure both street view green space quantity (SVG-quantity) and street view green space quality (SVG-quality). The results suggested that SVG-quantity and SVG-quality generate differential effects on subway use and travel satisfaction under residential and workplace contexts.

Cascading failure and recovery of metro–bus double-layer network considering recovery propagation,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103861,122,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Normal operation of metros and buses is essential for sustainable urban development. Studies have shown that a disaster occurring on one transport station leads to the cascading failure of transportation networks, but the functions will be restored successively after post-disaster repairs. However, most studies have focused on cascading failures, ignoring the impact of recovery propagation. Therefore, this study proposes a cascading failure and recovery model to illustrate the evolution process of a metro–bus double-layer network considering recovery propagation and investigates factors including failure and recovery spreading mechanisms, different initial loads, node capacities, and repair speeds. The proposed model is applied to an actual case study of Xi’an City under different scenarios. The effects of node capacity and repair speed exhibit a marginal decreasing trend.

Battery swapping and management system design for electric trucks considering battery degradation,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103860,122,2023-09-01,2023,9,"Battery swapping stations (BSSs) have been gradually adopted in reality for electric trucks (ETs) to improve their operational efficiency.

By explicitly incorporating the battery degradation effect, we develop a mathematical model to determine the optimal configuration of the BSS system to minimize the total system cost including the fixed investment cost and the battery lifecycle cost. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization model and then solved efficiently by a proposed solution procedure. A battery charging management strategy is further proposed. Through conducting numerical experiments, we find that the system design model can well capture the trade-off between the one-time battery purchase cost and the long-term battery degradation cost; and the battery charging management strategy significantly reduces the battery degradation cost, resulting in a more cost-efficient BSS system.",1361-9209,Not found

The results show that within 1–2 days, the leaching of alkali, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) fluctuates greatly, with acidic rain accelerating TN leaching. After long-term soaking, the pH of most leachate stabilizes at 8, and the leaching amounts of TN and TP in acidic leachant are 0.2 mg/kg and 0.04 mg/kg, respectively. PA with biochar leaches higher TN in deionized water (DI).

A mixed logit model is calibrated according to the responses from a travel survey to understand commuters’ perceptions towards bike-sharing in Singapore. The commuters’ perceptions obtained are then incorporated in tailored agent-based simulations to test the effects of promotion methods on the resulting mode share of bike-sharing as a commuting mode.

We answer these questions using two national datasets. Our results offer three overarching findings. First, we find significant demographic differences in who works shifts along lines of race, poverty status, immigration, and household type, differences reflecting occupational segregation. Black, Filipino, South Asian, and Indigenous commuters are significantly overrepresented at night. Second, evening and night shift workers are more likely to commute as car passengers or by bus or walking.

A path-based incentive scheme toward de-carbonized trips in a bi-modal traffic network,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103853,122,2023-09-01,2023,9,"This study proposes an innovative travel demand management (TDM) scheme of path-based incentives to relieve congestion and reduce carbon emissions in a bi-modal network of road traffic and subway. The path-differentiated incentive is rewarded to travelers in the form of subway credits, which can be exchanged for free subway tickets. Thus, the scheme can potentially ameliorate road traffic distribution and meanwhile attract travelers to take the subway. We thereby establish user equilibrium (UE) model in the bi-modal network and solve it via a Frank–Wolfe-type algorithm. Furthermore, a sensitivity-analysis-based (SAB) method is adopted to design the incentive scheme under a given budget. Numerical results demonstrate that with a limited credit budget, the incentive scheme can significantly reduce total travel cost and carbon emissions in the traffic system. Finally, a day-to-day microscopic simulation based on real data validates the robustness of the proposed scheme in a time-variant traffic system with strong randomness.",1361-9209,Not found

However, the decrease in car dependence may lead to two results when travel demands are constant: (1) transfer people to public transit, as the TOD advocates; (2) stimulate people to use other alternative automobile travel modes like ride-hailing. Therefore, this study systematically explored the relationship between TOD design, ride-hailing usage and car ownership through the case study of Chengdu, China. Our findings indicate that TOD design which aims to promote walkability/public transit and restrain driving, is associated with car ownership reduction. Whereas TOD design and reduced car ownership are related to incentivized use of ride-hailing. This study suggests a path of mobility resilience in automobile travel: those who are accustomed to being dependent on private cars would transfer to other alternative automobilized means to “recover” from habituated travel behaviors, even if under the “impact” of public transit-oriented incentives.",1361-9209,Not found

Using an extended and calibrated MATSim micro-simulation model, we reproduce agent-level mobility patterns for a representative day. Street-level PM10 emissions, mostly from cars, are extrapolated for the entire city to estimate concentration and exposure levels at hourly intervals. We show that exposure levels exceed the recommended 50 μ g/m 3 threshold between peak travel hours at home, education, and work locations. Among different socioeconomic status (SES) groups, urban, single, 15 years and younger, and those living near the city center face high exposure levels, while car users, that cause a majority of the emissions, are relatively less exposed. Finally, we show that Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles (SAEVs) reduce PM10 emissions, but the benefits are not homogeneously distributed across the different SES groups.",1361-9209,Not found
Empirical evaluation of behavioral interventions to enhance flexibility provision in smart charging,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103897,123,2023-10-01,2023,10,"The growing adoption of Electric vehicles (EVs) puts pressure on the power grid, and implementing smart solutions can ease this pressure. Smart charging at home is a solution where users offer flexibility in their charging schedule, which energy suppliers and/or other aggregators can exploit by charging during times of low demand and low market prices. However, giving charging control to the energy provider can concern EV users, particularly about driving range, and give a sense of loss of control. We conducted an experimental online survey with EV users (n = 289), examining the effect and perception of different behavioral interventions to improve flexibility provision. We found that all monetary incentives (high, low, credit points) resulted in higher flexibility, while environmental framing, feedback and badges, default-setting, and battery-related tips had no effect.

Traditional models often heavily rely on aggregated infrastructure or vehicle/passenger data, for example, the census survey, land-use, and traffic counts of one or several classes, which may lead to research gaps considering the emerging vehicle technologies. In addition, those models do not contain individual vehicular information. We propose an integrated data-driven method that combines multiple network modeling components, featuring the utilization of state-wide vehicle registration data. The additional vehicle registration data improve the model performance, and produce high-resolution vehicle-specific estimates of emissions and network performance metrics.

This research revealed that equity is not directly addressed or prioritised in cycling planning practice. On the contrary, there is a tendency towards the horizontal perspective, which expects an equal distribution of investments, resources, and service levels among all social groups, regardless of individual needs and constraints.

A mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model decides optimum speeds and heavy fuel oil (HFO)-banned areas for minimizing cost and emissions via NSR. Some scenarios indicate fewer emissions and costs from NSR with EC measures than NSR’s status quo and SCR when emissions taxes are enforced on both routes.

We estimate the environmental benefits of DLBS as the difference in carbon emissions between DLBS trips and their counterfactuals assuming DLBS was unavailable. We find that a DLBS commuting trip on average reduces carbon emission by 185.48 g, much higher than the previous estimates based solely on substitutive modal shifts.

The communication strategy relies only on the communication of optimal charging plan computed by EVs to stations without any reservation. In contrast, the reservation strategy enables additionally the booking of optimal charging time slots. In a dedicated multi-agent simulation framework, we tested both strategies on different levels of infrastructure saturation.

To this end, this paper develops a data-driven trip-chaining-based modeling framework including five steps: Trip data acquisition and preprocessing, EV adoption modeling, travel itinerary synthesis, EV charging demand simulation and EV load profile generation. The developed analysis framework was demonstrated using real-world data for one region in Virginia, U.S. The results show that the proposed modeling framework can work effectively. For the study region in 2040, the predicted number of plug-in EVs is 470,114, resulting in a weekly charging demand of 38,078,127 kWh (55 % home, 9 % work, and 36 % public) in September and 45,920,358 kWh (61 % home, 9 % work, and 30 % public) in February.",1361-9209,Not found
Quantifying emission and cost reduction potentials of Corporate Mobility as a Service,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103985,125,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Corporate Mobility as a Service (CMaaS) combines the advantages of company-exclusive and public mobility services, like carsharing, bikesharing, or taxis. Although prior research indicates that CMaaS has positive impacts on the GHG emissions and costs of corporate mobility, detailed analyses are still lacking. Against this background, we propose a methodology to quantify the potentials of CMaaS to reduce the GHG emissions and costs of corporate mobility. We apply a cost estimation, a Life Cycle Assessment, and a multi-objective optimization model to determine the pareto-optimal CMaaS designs for companies aiming to minimize GHG emissions and costs. Within the CMaaS design, we determine the fleet size and composition of company-exclusive, and the choice of price tariffs for public mobility services. By applying our methodology to a comprehensive case study that covers 428 driving profiles of 144 different companies, we deduce general insights on the potentials of CMaaS.",1361-9209,Not found
Do publicly developed logistics parks cause carbon emission transfer? Evidence from Chengdu,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103988,125,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Publicly developed logistics parks (PDLPs) have been considered one of the measures in urban logistics policies to reduce carbon emissions. In response, this paper draws on the “pollution transfer” hypothesis, constructs a carbon emission analysis framework for PDLPs, and uses spatial econometric methods to explore their carbon emission effects. The findings suggest that from a global perspective, PDLPs can lead to the emergence of “pollution havens” in the suburban and exurban areas while relieving the carbon emission burden in the urban core. Secondly, PDLPs can further contribute to forming “pollution havens” by promoting logistic re-agglomeration, and the “innovation compensation” effect of PDLPs is not significant. Finally, the carbon emission effects of PDLPs are spatiotemporally heterogeneous. A carbon reduction effect is noted when the logistic re-agglomeration in the location of PDLPs is higher, and an “innovation compensation” effect is also produced when the technological innovation is higher.",1361-9209,Not found
Aircraft noise impact prediction with incorporation of meteorological effects,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103945,125,2023-12-01,2023,12,"As part of a research effort towards greener aviation, this study focuses on the noise impact of aircraft operations around major airports. First, a pre-existing aircraft noise prediction platform based on a simplified (semi-empirical) approach is refined, to account for all refraction effects inherited from realistic (e.g., heterogeneous) atmospheres. To do so, the platform is enhanced with a more advanced noise propagation kernel relying on Ray Tracing, which combines state-of-the-art functionalities and novel refinements (e.g., to account for the three-dimensional nature of winds). This improved prediction platform is then validated against various benchmark cases, delivering outcomes of both phenomenological and methodological natures (e.g., the importance of accounting for 3D wind patterns whilst numerically handling them with care). Finally, the platform is applied to real-life situations involving representative aircraft operations and actual meteorological conditions, revealing how weather variations can significantly alter the propagation − and thus impact − of aircraft noise.",1361-9209,Not found

An integrated framework, SI Gap-ML-IG (Satisfaction Importance Gap-Machine Learning-Importance Grid), is proposed to identify factor attributes, asymmetric effects, and improvement priorities. The SI Gap reveals a large difference between user perception and expectation. Five machine learning algorithms and a traditional linear regression are then compared, and numerical results show that Random Forest is the most suitable method for predicting overall satisfaction and extracting derived importance. Improvements in noise isolation and actual range are shown to be urgently needed for both EV segments. For Mini EVs, three additional factors—safety, comfort, and purchase subsidy—need improving. For full-size EVs, improvements are needed in delivery time, charging queue time, and purchase price.

Modeling car dependency and policies towards sustainable mobility: A system dynamics approach,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103978,125,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Despite decades of research on urban transportation, few researchers apply a holistic understanding of the urban transport mechanism. To address this gap, in this paper we employed a two-stage modeling approach using a system dynamics method and theory of path dependence. First, an exploratory model presents the structure, including feedback loops and underlying mechanisms of the evolution of car dependency. The model explores loop dominance, and implicit goals determine whether it is a car-dependent or transit-oriented and active modes-based transport system. Car dependence arises from the dominance of road-based feedback loops for commuters to achieve their transportation goals. Second, a revised policy structure reveals that shifting the loop dominance towards transit-oriented and active modes-based transportation system is possible when commuters achieve their goals through transit and active infrastructure-based feedback loops. The scale and timing of policy leverages determine the thresholds for the loop dominance shift.",1361-9209,Not found

RTNM is composed of two parts: i) the Vehicle Noise Specific Power model (for the assessment of the sound power level – L w of passenger cars, considering speed and motorization information) coupled with the CNOSSOS model (for the estimation of heavy-duty vehicles’ L w); and ii) a sound propagation model (to evaluate noise levels at the receiver point). Inputs for the RTNM are retrieved from a radar installed in Aveiro city, Portugal, while the model estimations are validated by comparing them with levels recorded by a noise sensor installed close to the radar. It was found that the resulting noise estimations are robust, with associated mean absolute percentage errors not exceeding 5.8%.",1361-9209,Not found

This study aims to quantify this concern by characterizing the leaching process of AR using a multi-scale experimental method. The effects of various experimental variables on the leaching process were determined, and the leaching of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were characterized at three scales, i.e., binder, mortar, and mixture. The results suggested that AR presents no significant leaching concerns under most conditions, but the leaching of metals from AR might pose risks to the aquatic environments in the areas with acid rain. Furthermore, the leachability of metals increases with service time due to the aging of asphalt binder. The findings of this study can contribute to a better understanding of the environmental performance of AR and help conduct AR construction and maintenance in a more sustainable manner.",1361-9209,Not found

Using two-wave survey data of 1002 pairs of spouses collected in 2014 and 2016, the study investigates the longitudinal relationships between the residential BE, commuting attributes, and life satisfaction and how the relationships differ between spouses. The results of cross-lagged models suggest that the residential BE and commuting attributes have significant effects on life satisfaction within each wave. Those who commute by active modes are more likely to have lower life satisfaction in the near future. All residential BE variables show lagged effects on husbands' life satisfaction, whereas only residential density and entropy matter to wives.

This study addresses this gap by employing a bottom-up emission estimation model and constructing a high spatiotemporal resolution road freight emission inventory using GPS trajectory data from over 17,000 heavy-duty trucks (HDTs) in Shenzhen. Spatiotemporal analysis reveals distinct patterns and spatial non-stationarity in CO2 emissions from road freight transportation. A multiscale geographically weighted regression model is applied to analyze the potential factors that may influence CO2 emissions at varying spatial scales.

SH EVs could speed vehicle electrification, but also present environmental and economic risks because they are larger and reach retirement faster than new EVs. Understanding future flows of used and new EVs into Mexico’s fleet, and their expected retirement, is needed to understand if SH EVs provide a net benefit. This research uses system dynamics modeling to project future EV adoption and SH vehicle trade between the US and Mexico. Results show EVs will comprise nearly 50% of Mexico’s fleet and up to 99% of SH imports by 2050, and SH EV batteries disproportionately contribute to the stock of spent EV batteries.

Sustainable decisions in a ridesharing system with a tri-objective optimization approach,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103958,125,2023-12-01,2023,12,"Over the past years, the concept of ridesharing started receiving more attention to improve the sustainability of transportation systems. Although this concept has a lot of potential due to effective utilization of vehicles, there are still some challenges associated with routing and scheduling of the available vehicles, emissions produced by vehicles, and excessive delays in reaching the final destination. Therefore, this study proposes a novel tri-objective optimization model for routing and scheduling decisions within a ridesharing system, aiming to minimize the total travel time, the total carbon dioxide emissions produced throughout the transportation process, and the total delay in reaching the designated destination. A Multi-Objective Red Deer Algorithm is developed to find efficient Pareto solutions intelligently. The computational experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm against the alternative methods. Furthermore, the conducted sensitivity analyses reveal some important managerial insights that could be used for intelligent planning of ridesharing systems.",1361-9209,Not found

The study uses travel data (n = 1223) from Nord-Jæren, Norway, to develop a Structural Equation Model (SEM) that explores the relationship between environmental beliefs, attitudes, and travel behaviour (i.e., use of conventional car, electric car, bus, and bicycle). The results confirm that pro-environmental beliefs have a “spillover effect” on EV use due to existing car attitudes. The relative convenience of the car over alternative options has been found to be the most important mitigating factor in the influence of environmental beliefs on behaviour. Consequently, to reduce car use and promote more sustainable travel options, it is essential to simultaneously improve these alternatives while restricting car traffic.",1361-9209,Not found

A robust coordinated charging scheduling approach for hybrid electric bus charging systems,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103955,125,2023-12-01,2023,12,"This paper proposes a coordinated electric bus (EB) charging scheduling approach for hybrid charging stations that support plug-in charging and battery-swapping simultaneously.

In the deterministic model, the remaining capacity upon arrival at the station is assumed to be known. However, in practice, the remaining capacity of the EB is typically uncertain due to unpredictable traffic conditions. Therefore, this paper proposes an RO model to address this uncertainty, utilizing a budgeted uncertainty set and developing the affinely adjustable robust counterpart.

Dynamic metrics are: 1) redundancy (daily unique number of centers visited), 2) frequency (daily number of visits to dialysis centers), and 3) proximity (visits weighted by distance to dialysis centers). The results show that: the extent of dependence of regions on dialysis centers varies; flooding significantly reduces access redundancy and frequency of dialysis centers; regions with a greater minority percentage and lower household income were likely to experience extensive disruptions; high-income regions more quickly revert to pre-disaster levels; larger centers located in non-flooded areas are critical to absorbing the unmet demand from disrupted facilities.",1361-9209,Not found

Results show that identities tied to structures of power promote a greater contribution to air pollution than other mechanisms. That is, middle-aged European-born men have the most NOx-intensive mobility practices. In contrast, people that embody intersectional experiences of oppression such as misogyny, racism, or ageism, have lower emission levels.

With respect to CO2 emissions, we specifically examine emissions in vehicle production besides the commonly considered emissions in vehicle use. Our econometric analysis reveals a strong stated preference for the reduction of both components of life-cycle CO2 emissions. Furthermore, we find that conventional vehicles are significantly preferred over electric vehicles. Surprisingly, environmental attitudes, i.e. environmental awareness and ecological policy identification, have no significant effects on the reduction of CO2 emissions. Instead, citizens with a strong environmental identity rather tend to avoid the purchase of conventional vehicles. We discuss several practical policy implications.",1361-9209,Not found

Changes in intra-city transport accessibility accompanying the occurrence of an urban flood,10.1016/j.trd.2023.104040,126,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Flooding of the urban transport systems is becoming ever more common, and their ability to function under such conditions requires detailed research. The main objective of this study was to determine the changes (mainly in their spatial nature) of intra-urban transport accessibility of a large city (Lodz) when impacted by urban flooding. The study utilised a variety of data, including the Digital Terrain Model, the Topographic Object Database and the Road Transport Speed Model. These were employed to determine those areas where disruption to the transport system may occur under varying degrees of rainfall (15-minute rainfall with a 20% probability of occurrence and maximum daily totals – an empirical probability of approximately 1.4%). Next, the changes in potential accessibility due to the occurrence of flooding were determined for different scenarios (various depths of flood water). In order to identify the absolute and relative changes in potential accessibility following a flood in the different scenarios, its value in a “normal” situation had to be calculated for all journey lengths in question. The study revealed that there is no correlation between the location of flooded sections of the network and the spatial differentiation of drops in travel times (analysed topologically) or declines in potential accessibility (irrespective of how attractive the destination is).",1361-9209,Not found
Inferring trip purposes and mode substitution effect of rental e-scooters in London,10.1016/j.trd.2023.104034,126,2024-01-01,2024,1,"The lack of information on trip purpose and alternative mode in micromobility service usage data remains a major analytical challenge. Conventional survey method is subject to significant sampling and stated preference biases. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a new inference method through a case study of rental e-scooters in London. The inference method features a rule-based algorithm for matching observed rental e-scooter trips with filtered trip samples in the English National Travel Survey (NTS) series. Probability distribution of trip purposes and alternative modes are then retrieved from NTS. Inference results are validated using official data. Discrepancies, sources of biases and correction measures are investigated. Based on the inferred mode substitution pattern, we estimate greenhouse gas emissions reduction of selected rental e-scooter trips in London (36–103 g CO2e per mile). It is expected that the proposed method is applicable to a wide range of micromobility studies using service usage data.",1361-9209,Not found
Rural mobility in later life; counteracting accessibility poverty with digital service solutions,10.1016/j.trd.2023.104030,126,2024-01-01,2024,1,"Norrbotten region is one of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe, with often long distances to services. This paper aims to gain a deeper understanding of the everyday mobilities in later life in rural areas, and to assess to what extent digital service solutions (DiSS) can contribute to reduced accessibility poverty. The study focuses on how DiSS contribute to more equitable accessibility by means of a case study in two villages, selected due to implemented DiSS (store with digital locks, digital hubs, etc.). Interviews with older people and other informants show the potential of DiSS to counteract accessibility poverty by bringing services nearer to home and reducing the need for longer trips, while contributing to the creation of healthier and more resilient environments. If implemented carefully, DiSS can have the potential to contribute to the development of more transport-efficient and socially just societies.",1361-9209,Not found
Adaptive maintenance strategies to mitigate climate change impacts on asphalt pavements,10.1016/j.trd.2023.104026,126,2024-01-01,2024,1,"This study aims to explore the potential of optimization-based maintenance strategies in adapting asphalt pavements to future climate change. Based on a highway network in Jiangsu, China, the impacts of climate change, characterized by global warming and intensified precipitation, on pavement life cycle cost (LCC) and performance were quantitively assessed, and the benefits of maintenance optimization in mitigating climate change impacts were examined. The findings indicate that climate change may increase pavement rutting depth and reduce pavement roughness and skid resistance, while its effect on transverse cracking varies over time. Adjusting the maintenance schedules, but still following the threshold-based approach, would increase the LCC by about 15.5 %∼19.1 %. The optimization-based maintenance decision-making model significantly mitigates climate change impacts, ultimately even saving 0.6 % of LCCs compared to the baseline. The outcomes will provide a quantitative understanding of the climate change impacts on asphalt pavements, as well as adaptive maintenance strategies to improve pavement resilience.",1361-9209,Not found

We used the entropy weighting analysis method to calculate the urban public transport service index based on multi-source geographic and transportation services data in China. QAP (Quadratic Assignment Procedure) regression was used to explore the factors affecting differences in traffic service. Our results showed a significant gap among regions. Prefecture-level cities with highly-developed economies, large geographical areas, or special status (such as province capitals) had high transportation service levels. Transportation services inequity was caused by the economic base of different local governments, resulting in differences in their financial support for public services. We also found that the disparity in transportation services narrowed over time, indicating that transportation service investment has long-term effects.

We recorded sleep-EEG and noise exposure in residents’ bedrooms in early sleepers (bedtime: 22:00–22:30, rise time: 6:00–6:30; 2011: N = 49; 2012: N = 42) and late sleepers (bedtime: 23:00–23:30, rise time 7:00–7:30; 2012 only: N = 41). Early sleepers were exposed to 26.8 ± 15.7 (mean per time in bed ± STD) overflights in 2011, and 14.9 ± 9.3 in 2012. Late sleepers were exposed to 24.6 ± 14.7 overflights in 2012. Number of awakenings was 27.5% lower in early sleepers in 2012 than in 2011 (p < 0.001).

To fill this gap, a survey gathering 15,666 responses from residents in the Region of Madrid was conducted. A Multilevel Ordered Logit explored the individual and spatial dimensions of the potential of shared mobility to reduce car ownership. The results show that frequent car users and individuals owning more cars are less likely to believe they could give them up, but the adoption of moped-sharing or carsharing moderates this effect. For those who do not own a car, shared-mobility seems to be effective reducing their perceived need to own one in the future.

The framework enables a spatiotemporal analysis of traffic flows at the link level, allowing us to identify the primary factors that contribute to vulnerability after a disaster. The results show that there is a significant variation in link vulnerability over time, with the overall network gradually returning to a normal state. We also observe a global correlation in link vulnerability across the spatial aspect, although the autocorrelation effect is only present among directly contiguous links. Furthermore, metrics affecting link vulnerability varied during different periods of response.

The time for half of the carcasses to disappear was less than 30 min for birds and 1–18 h for amphibians depending on the volume of traffic, which is much shorter than previous estimates. We show the implications of our results by performing roadkill surveys on common toads 3 h after the window of reproductive migration, showing roadkill is under-estimated by half, and by estimating from citizen-science data that passerine collisions could be as high as 10 individuals.km-2.year-1 in south-eastern France.",1361-9209,Not found

Aiming to understand the motivations for actual purchase behaviour, a questionnaire was sent to both existing EV owners and potential consumers in different-tier Chinese cities. Results indicate regional variations in the motivations for purchasing EVs and reveal the presence of the intention-behaviour gap. Specifically, consumers in high-tier cities (first-tier and second-tier cities) are mostly driven by social norms but restricted by reduction in expenditure; consumers in low-tier cities (third-tier cities and below) are driven by technological interests. Environmental protection, privilege, and convenience may increase the purchase intention, but do not directly lead to purchase behaviour.

Sensitivity analysis examines the impact of swapping penetration, initial power, and swapping threshold on the swapping demand. Findings suggest that increasing swapping penetration by 1% leads to a rise of 692 and 139 in one-day swapping demand for ordinary and delivery EMVs, respectively.

Using different transport modes: An opportunity to reduce UK passenger transport emissions?,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103989,126,2024-01-01,2024,1,"In 2022, transport accounted for around one third of UK territorial emissions. Many decarbonisation pathways include modal shift as a possible way of reducing passenger transport emissions. Yet, the mitigation potential of modal shift often depends on generic behavioural assumptions rather than the technical feasibility for using different transport modes. Here travel microdata from the UK is used to systematically assess which trips could use more efficient transport modes, establishing a theoretical maximum for how much modal shift could take place with no reduction in mobility. Compared to current passenger transport use, emissions could be reduced by about 30% by changing the transport modes used for personal travel. This is possible if car use is reduced by approximately 27% and mainly replaced by trains. Further emissions savings are possible by increasing bicycle and motorcycle availability, increasing capacity of coach and surface rail, and increasing the time typically spent travelling.",1361-9209,Not found
Metro-line expansions and local air quality in Shenzhen: Focusing on network effects,10.1016/j.trd.2023.103991,126,2024-01-01,2024,1,"We examine the air-quality effects of urban-rail development in Shenzhen, taking a difference-in-differences approach.

New station openings had no significant impacts on local air quality or even worsened it until the 2010 metro-line extension, when Shenzhen’s metro network density was still low, with limited spatial service coverage. However, the 2016 extension significantly abated air pollution as the network grew denser and more comprehensive. The rail-driven anti-pollution effects tended to be further strengthened with externalities arising from improved network connectivity, spilling over the effects beyond newly opened stations to preexisting ones. Also, metro stations in proximity to neighborhoods that share key characteristics in transit-oriented development tended to generate a greater anti-pollution effect.",1361-9209,Not found

Rising temperatures intensify the likelihood of rutting in asphalt pavements. This research, covering seven Chinese provinces from 2021 to 2100, predicts asphalt pavement rutting depth on freeways and secondary roadways for the next 80 years. The study introduced the Rutting Climate Change Index to gauge climate change impact on pavement rutting. It examined regional variations in climate's effect on pavement rutting and associated factors. The results indicate that both longitude and latitude significantly influence the Rutting Climate Change Index for asphalt pavement rutting distress. With increasing longitude, the impact of climate change on rutting distress in asphalt pavement exhibits diverse patterns across different regions. The influence of climate change on rutting distress in asphalt pavement increases with higher latitudes.

This work presents a novel HDT driving cycle construction framework based on big data under segmented usage scenarios. To validate it, sixty million driving data of three thousand HDTs were collected, based on which six segmented cycles of two typical classes of HDTs (i.e., dump trucks and truck-tractors) are constructed. Then, systematic analyses between six segmented cycles are conducted, and the constructed cycles are compared to the legislated driving cycles in China (CHTC). The results indicate that the constructed driving cycles can well represent real-world driving data, and the cycle-specific fuel consumption from simulations accord with the empirics.

Examining electric vehicle adoption at the postal code level in US states,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104068,127,2024-02-01,2024,2,"Electrification of the transportation sector has grown substantially over recent years, though much remains unclear regarding the continued trajectory of electric vehicle (EV) adoption and its influencing factors. The impacts of charging infrastructure and the geographic heterogeneity of adopter characteristics are two facets not fully understood. This work investigates EV adoption at a granular geographic level using spatial econometric methods. The dataset – ZIP (postal) code-level EV population in four US states since 2011 – is more comprehensive than previous studies at a granular geographic level have used. The work finds that battery EV and plug-in hybrid EV forecasts must be developed separately. Spatial clustering is significant and cannot be ignored; geographic variations in sociodemographic and land use measures are found to influence adoption and their intensity varies by state. Finally, existing data permits a better understanding of these relationships with respect to the earliness of adoption rather than the rate of adoption in ZIP codes.",1361-9209,Not found

One of the important questions that infrastructure managers need to answer is, “How will maintenance costs be affected due to climate change in different climate change scenarios?” This paper proposes an approach to estimate the implication of climate change on the life cycle cost (LCC) of railways infrastructure assets. The proportional hazard model is employed to capture the dynamic effects of climate change on reliability parameters and LCC of railway assets. A use-case from a railway in North Sweden is analyzed to validate the proposed process using data collected over 18 years.

This research examines the potential efficiency and environmental benefits of a flexible pick-up and drop-off (PUDO) strategy, which seeks to improve the routing efficiency by shifting the PUDO locations within short walking distance. A two-stage heuristic method is developed to identify suitable PUDO locations while considering both the detour and congestion factors. Using DiDi Chuxing trip data from central Chengdu, China, we find that 8%–23% of trips can be improved, reducing driving distance and time by up to 15%, and saving 11.6–51.1 GJ of energy consumption and 0.8–3.7 tons of CO 2 emissions in a single working day.

The prior literature has estimated relationships between street network design and transport emissions – including greenhouse gases implicated in climate change – primarily through case studies focusing on certain world regions or relatively small samples of cities, complicating generalizability and applicability for evidence-informed practice. Our worldwide study finds that straighter, more-connected, and less-overbuilt street networks are associated with lower transport emissions, all else equal. Importantly, these relationships vary across development levels and design paradigms – yet most prior literature reports findings from urban areas that are outliers by global standards. Planners need a better empirical base for evidence-informed practice in under-studied regions, particularly the rapidly urbanizing Global South.",1361-9209,Not found

However, existing research on active travel relies on limited survey data and generalized linear models. To fill the gap, our study integrates large-scale big trip data and data-driven machine learning to simultaneously predict active travel flow and probability. We employ SHapley Additive exPlanation to analyze the nonlinear effects of various characteristics (e.g., travel, socioeconomic, infrastructure, environment) on active travel. Gradient Boosting Decision Tree performs best for both prediction tasks. The overall importance of travel distance is over 50% to the model. Features like crow-fly distance, housing price, point-of-interest density, subway proximity, building area/road density, and urban greenery exhibit pronounced nonlinear effects. Local interpretability analysis reveals the determinants of specific trips, facilitating targeted optimization implications.

Transportation network resilience response to the spatial feature of hazards,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104121,128,2024-03-01,2024,3,"Reliable assessment of the resilience of transportation networks to natural disasters is a prominent issue. This paper investigates how the spatial feature of natural disasters affects the resilience of transportation networks. Our research reveals that incorporating spatial feature data on disaster impacts is highly important for assessing network resilience. More precisely, the uncertainty linked to the estimation of the resilience index in the context of disaster-induced interruptions with spatial feature significantly exceeds that of conventional approaches. We present an illustrative case of a transportation network affected by a hurricane. The results reveal that the improved characteristics of disaster-induced outages greatly alter the manner in which the network recovers, including changes in emergency system characteristics. Our research indicates that extant methodologies employed for evaluating the resilience of critical infrastructure potentially inflate the confidence levels pertaining to network recovery predictions, primarily owing to insufficient attention given to the spatial configuration of disasters.",1361-9209,Not found

Whilst electric buses do break down sooner if the ramp is used more often, more stops made along the route served by the electric buses increase the distance traveled by the electric buses until a breakdown occurs. Public transport operators are encouraged to continue deploying electric buses, especially along shorter routes with numerous stops, and to undergo preventive maintenance every two weeks.

The findings show that platform safety, driver competence, car comfort, environmental benefit, and social benefit significantly affect travel satisfaction. The influence of order matching efficiency on satisfaction is non-significant but contributes to improving subjective well-being. Environmental concern positively moderates the effect of satisfaction on subjective well-being. Additionally, platform safety significantly improves female satisfaction while environmental concern significantly enhances male satisfaction. Order matching efficiency exerts a stronger impact on improving well-being in the shared travel mode than in the non-shared travel mode.

The analysis demonstrates that shipping alliances promotes green shipping investments, even with increased shipping traffic, leading to an overall reduction in emissions. While these alliances improve shipper surplus, the enhancement of social welfare depends on whether cost savings from reduced emissions outweigh higher investment costs associated with green shipping. Endogenizing emission tax results in lower social-optimal emission tax, which drives more shipping traffic, offsetting emissions reduction from increased green shipping investment.",1361-9209,Not found

To explore this problem, this study investigates China’s transportation CO2 emissions based on the multi-layered structural paths by utilizing the environmental input–output model and the structural path analysis method. Several crucial findings are revealed from our analysis. Firstly, the CO2 emissions resulting from transportation final demand and intermediate demand display a significant upward trend. Secondly, four major CO2 emitting sectors are identified. Thirdly, the key production chain paths of transportation demand leading to CO2 emissions are found. Finally, the study concludes emphasizes that the efforts to reduce CO2 emissions in the transportation sector should focus on the key sectors and production chains in the transportation sector.",1361-9209,Not found
Analysing changes in grocery shopping trips after COVID-19: Nagpur case study,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104073,128,2024-03-01,2024,3,"The COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the usage of online platforms for grocery shopping, resulting in lasting changes in shopping behaviour. Even as the severity of the pandemic subsides, online grocery shopping continues to grow. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) and surveyed 1650 households in Nagpur city (India) to understand these changes. Results show increased online grocery shopping, reduced in-store visits, and shorter trip distances post-pandemic. Socio-demographics, internet usage, accessibility, and shopping attitudes influence these changes. Positive attitudes towards online shopping and online search behaviour drive the shift to online grocery purchases, impacting brick-and-mortar store visits. Positive attitudes towards online shopping, internet usage, store distance, and changes in offline trips also influence store choices. These findings highlight the substantial influence of online shopping on demand for travel and land use, emphasising the need for comprehensive planning integrating these factors.",1361-9209,Not found
Consumer purchase response to e-bike incentives: Results from a nationwide stated preference study,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104114,129,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Electric bike (e-bike) incentives are gaining popularity to increase ownership of e-bikes, with goals of increased mobility while reducing emissions. This study is among the first to experimentally analyze prospective purchase behavior of e-bike consumers to assess price sensitivity, behavioral response to incentives, and consumer value of e-bike attributes. We present results of a nationwide (20 cities) stated-preference survey and find e-bike incentives are powerful levers to shift behavior. Different incentive mechanisms have different behavioral utility. Point-of-purchase discounts are the most influential at shifting behavior, followed by tax credits, then mail-in rebates. Point-of-purchase discounts are 30% more effective than mail-in rebates. Across point-of-purchase scenarios, the average inframarginal cost of an added e-bike purchase is $4252 (range $3719 to $4799). Income-based schemes that are often aimed at increasing equity result in cost-effectiveness trade-offs. Policy makers should evaluate the investment in e-bike purchase incentives across benefits from added e-bike ownership that include not only greenhouse gas reductions, but also health benefits, increased mobility, travel affordability, safety, and congestion reductions.",1361-9209,Not found
Does urban bus route assignment improve air quality?,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104146,129,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Worldwide, one of the most important causes of mortality is air pollution. To solve this problem, governments have implemented policies to reduce on-road and industrial emissions. In this regard, the Barcelona city council and Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) started implementing the Nova Xarxa de Bus (NXB) to redefine the bus network following the criteria of connectivity, efficiency, and rationality. This policy was implemented in seven phases from 2012 to 2018. In this context, this paper analyses the impact of this policy on Barcelona’s air quality using a dataset from 2008 to 2016. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we show that implementing these new routes increased air quality in Barcelona. Additionally, we show that pollution decreased in each phase analysed, especially in the air quality stations near the main roads. From our results, we can infer that an optimal bus route design can improve air quality in urban areas.",1361-9209,Not found
Modeling the impact of normative messages on travel behavior change,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104145,129,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Prompted by previous research indicating associations between social norms and travel behavior, this study examines the effectiveness of a persuasive normative intervention on car commuters in Cagliari, Italy. The intervention provided (descriptive and/or injunctive) normative statements to encourage a shift from the car to a sustainable travel alternative, namely walking, cycling, or transit, suggested through a Personalized Travel Plan. The construction of an Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model allowed for controlling for level of service, socioeconomic, and psychological variables. Results showed how the injunctive normative message significantly increased public transport intention, particularly when individuals perceived a higher level of behavioral control. However, no significant impact was found for active mobility. Pseudo-elasticity effects showed how the injunctive message had a similar impact as the travel time difference between cars and public transport. This work is valuable for policymakers as it provides insightful best practices for low-budget normative messaging to promote sustainable travel behaviors.",1361-9209,Not found
Signal synchronization methods when measuring tailpipe emissions with PEMS,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104154,129,2024-04-01,2024,4,"This study describes the effects of using different signal synchronization methods on the tailpipe emission factors obtained by on-road tests using PEMS (Portable Emission Measurement Systems). The event-based, static correlation, and dynamics correlation methods were applied to data obtained using different PEMS. The first database included 36 cargo vehicles following the same driving cycle in various cities in Colombia. The second database involved 16 passenger transport vehicles monitored under real operating conditions in Mexico. When comparing results with the event-based synchronization method as the reference, significant differences in emission factors (>25 %) were observed. Those differences depend directly on the physical setup of the PEMS. The dynamic correlation method exhibited the best performance in all cases. When using this method, we recommend to synchronize the CO2 mass flow and fuel consumption variables first and then adjust the obtained synchronization to other species to account for differences in species diffusivities.",1361-9209,Not found
Well-being implications of mobility of care: Gender differences among U.S. adults,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104109,129,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Mobility of care (caregiving- and household-serving shopping travel) is ubiquitous in daily travel, but how it impacts well-being is unclear. Using a multivariate random effects panel regression model, this study examines the distinct associations between activity participation (including a range of activities from maintenance to leisure-related activities) and subjective well-being (SWB). The most striking gender difference in SWB is observed during caregiving travel: only women tend to experience increased stress, decreased happiness, and decreased sense of meaning during caregiving travel (when compared to leisure activities, the neutral reference category). We find that heightened time pressure among women may explain some of these differences, given their higher probabilities of performing caregiving travel (unchanged by their employment status or that of their partner) on typical weekdays. Thus, gender-sensitive planning should prioritize infrastructure and services that facilitate the independent travel of care recipients, including children, disabled adults, and older adults.",1361-9209,Not found

The valuation of delays in passenger rail using journey satisfaction data,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104088,129,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Stated preference surveys are typically used to derive lateness multipliers, defined as a trade-off between a minute of lateness and scheduled journey time. This study aims to use a novel in the context of lateness valuation dataset (i.e. responses from a survey on journey satisfaction) to apply it to the established methodologies. Travel satisfaction data from National Rail Passenger Survey in Great Britain is used to estimate the impacts of scheduled journey time and delay on passenger satisfaction. An ordered logit model with origin–destination pair fixed effects is estimated and lateness multipliers are subsequently derived. The estimated values are slightly larger than previously suggested, ranging from 4 to 9 for arrival delay (i.e. a minute of arrival delay is valued as an equivalent of 4–9 min of scheduled journey time) and 2 to 6 for departure delay.

Market-driven transformation policy for mobility electrification: An agent-based modelling approach,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104148,129,2024-04-01,2024,4,"The unsustainable nature of electric vehicle (EV) purchase subsidies compels the automotive industry to seek more cost-effective policy tools to accelerate electrification, which warrants the examination of an emerging solution: the dual-credit policy to replace subsidies. The researchers in this study built an agent-based model with a credit trading mechanism for the passenger vehicle market to simulate bottom-up industry policy transformation in the medium to long term. The results indicate that the dual-credit policy favours the growth of battery electric vehicles while restraining the expansion of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). It accelerates electrification, with EV production surpassing that of ICEVs six years earlier than under subsidies. Additionally, the credit trading mechanism under the current conditions of the policy can remain effective for six years. If combined with credit supply regulatory measures, it can be extended by another two years. Notably, this policy suits markets with a mature electrification base.",1361-9209,Not found

However, the impact is unclear because power system operation involves the cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and flexibility requirements for imbalances caused by renewable energies. To clarify the robustness of the environmental impact of BEVs, we assessed the interactions between CO2 prices and flexibility requirements in Japan in 2030 using a production cost model. The results showed that uncontrolled charging increases CO2 emissions, whereas V1G or V2G reduces them. Further, the impact of BEVs was non-monotonic with respect to CO2 prices, implying that policymakers should carefully evaluate CO2 prices to achieve decarbonization as BEVs do not always reduce CO2 emissions.

Is electric truck a viable alternative to diesel truck in long-haul operation?,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104119,129,2024-04-01,2024,4,"This study investigates the feasibility of long-haul electric truck (e-truck) adoption as a competitive alternative to diesel trucks from a truck carrier’s point of view, which can shed light on policy to boost e-truck adoption for policy makers. Specifically, we propose a total operating cost optimization model called an e-truck routing and driver scheduling problem with coordinated charging schedule (eTRDSP-CS) to find optimal charging schedules – when and where to charge – for long-haul e-trucks. We then apply it to four interstate corridors of various distances in the U.S. highway system and compare the operating cost and energy use with the diesel truck counterparts. The results show that while it is technologically feasible to facilitate long-haul e-truck operation on the interstate highways, the prolonged journey time (between 16 and 32 %) due to charging and the high initial adoption cost remain key obstacles for adoption from a fleet carrier’s point of view. Every hour of revenue time requires an additional 19 to 25 min for charging (non-revenue time). On the other hand, long-haul e-truck provides over 43 % energy saving from diesel truck, which has significant implications for environmental sustainability.",1361-9209,Not found
Electric vehicles in urban delivery fleets: How far can they go?,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104127,129,2024-04-01,2024,4,"The goal of this study is to provide insights into the expected role of medium-duty electric vehicles (EVs) in urban delivery fleets and to analyze the effectiveness of EV subsidies on EV fleet penetration and tailpipe emissions. To meet this goal, we propose a modeling framework that determines the minimum-cost fleet size and fleet mix (of EVs and conventional vehicles) and vehicle routes for a profit-maximizing delivery company. Second, we conduct extensive analyses using this modeling framework and Southern California network data; we vary the EV driving range, per-mile cost of EVs, demand rate, service region size/structure, driver working hours, and network travel times. We find that the optimal fleet mix nearly always includes EVs and conventional vehicles. Moreover, we find that EV subsidies have limited effectiveness with current EV batteries and service regions designed around conventional vehicles. Hence, improving EV battery technology is critical to electrifying urban delivery fleets.",1361-9209,Not found
Multiple reference points of commute time in commute satisfaction,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104115,129,2024-04-01,2024,4,"Commute time is an important determinant of commute satisfaction. However, commuters may perceive the same length of commute differently and adopt different standards (reference points) to evaluate their commute time. This paper explores the effects of commute time discrepancies relative to four reference points on commute satisfaction based on a survey in Guangzhou, China. The reference points include ideal commute time (ICT), acceptable commute time (ACT), comparison other’s commute time (COCT), and non-congested commute time (NCCT). We find that the gaps between actual commute time and the four reference points are all important for commute satisfaction, though ICT and ACT seem to be more salient reference points in evaluating commute satisfaction. Our analysis also confirms the loss aversion phenomenon, as the effect sizes of loss variables tend to be larger than those of gain variables. The effects on satisfaction with commute to and from work are also different.",1361-9209,Not found

A four-dimensional conceptual framework, encompassing market foundation, industrial foundation, policy support and usage environment, is proposed to investigate the potential contributors to the EV market resilience. The models are applied to China’s provincial EV markets, and the geographical detector model is used for empirical investigation. We identify an imbalanced distribution of regional EV market resilience, characterized by a spatial clustering of high-performing regions. Notably, a majority of regions encounter challenges in simultaneously achieving high performance in both resistance and recoverability.

To advance the self-healing technique, this paper proposes a pioneering approach involving a dual microwave-heating pathway to produce a type of microwave-heating healing asphalt concrete that can offer better self-healing ability. Throughout the healing process, limestone powder filler is substituted with a waste microwave-sensitivity ferrite powder filler, primarily remedying microcracks within asphalt mastic. Additionally, the conventional aggregate is substituted with a functional aggregate to establish a three-dimensional thermally conductive framework under microwave radiation, effectively repairing microcracks at the aggregate-asphalt interface. The experimental findings reveal that the optimized formulation retains a substantial healing index of 70% after undergoing three damage-healing-damage cycles, with a reduction of 4% in crack resistance.

How would co-opetition with dry ports affect seaports’ adaptation to disasters?,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104194,130,2024-05-01,2024,5,"The development of dry ports has reshaped the international freight shipping market, introducing both competition pressure (i.e., the common hinterland) and cooperation opportunities (sea-rail intermodal) for seaports. This is more evident in China with the development of the China Railway Express. Unlike dry ports, seaports are more vulnerable to climate change-related disasters, calling for investment in adaptation measures. This paper examines how co-opetition with the dry port affects seaport adaptation investment using a two-stage game-theoretical economic model. Results indicate that cooperation leads to more seaport adaptation investment, while competition results in reduced investment. When compared to the social optimal level of adaptation investment, the seaport tends to under-invest (over-invest) when the cooperation (competition) market size is larger. We also analyze how government subsidies in the seaport’s adaptation help achieve optimal social adaptation and how the Knightian uncertainty of the disaster occurrence affects seaport adaptation investments.

These credits can then be used to access the reward mode (e.g., using priority lanes). This CRS design problem is formulated as a leader–follower game, where the transport authority determines the reward ratio based on the mode choices of travelers. We analyze how the CRS affects emissions and traffic congestion, and conduct two numerical studies on Beijing and London to verify our findings.

The results show that if ridehailing costs increase by 10%, ridehailing trips decrease by 6.97%. About half of the lost riders would switch to driving, and 20% to transit. Therefore, driving, rather than transit, is the closest substitute for ridehailing. Furthermore, 10% reductions in transit time and transit cost are associated with a 24.63% and 5.03% increase in transit trips, respectively, suggesting that reducing travel time is more effective in increasing transit ridership than lowering fares.",1361-9209,Not found
From cart to door: Unravelling consumer behaviour through attitudinal sustainability profiles,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104168,130,2024-05-01,2024,5,"In the evolving landscape of the retail industry, e-commerce has reshaped consumer behaviour, including the last mile delivery. Despite consumers typically having the final say when it comes to delivery requirements, research on last mile deliveries frequently overlooks consumer behaviour. Addressing this gap, this study explores consumer attitudes towards sustainability in last mile deliveries and assesses their impact on behavior and travel patterns. Utilizing an online survey of 2105 e-consumers, four distinct attitudinal profiles are identified —positive, neutral (due to knowledge or interest gaps), and negative attitude, shedding light on parcel weight preferences and travel patterns. The study uncovers a green attitude-behavior gap, emphasizing the need for interventions that bridge intention and action. By unraveling these complexities, this research contributes essential insights for retailers and researchers, guiding the development of targeted strategies to promote sustainable practices in the evolving landscape of e-commerce.",1361-9209,Not found
Effects of freight curbside management on sustainable cities: Evidence and paths forward,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104165,130,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Freight curbside management has become a contentious issue as various stakeholders claim access to public urban space. Although prior research has offered solutions to mitigate freight-related conflicts in the use of space, a deeper understanding of the extent to which those interventions contribute to cities’ sustainable development goals is needed. This paper presents the results of a meta-analysis that examines the effects of four freight curbside interventions: curbside space allocation for freight, data sharing, parking duration limits, and enforcement. The paper pinpoints benefits and drawbacks of those interventions on last-mile deliveries, the urban environment, and the use of public transport infrastructure. The findings suggest positive impacts and underscore the necessity of incorporating people-centred approaches in the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies concerning public space. Nevertheless, trade-offs when implementing those interventions have been identified. The paper concludes by outlining directions for future research and suggesting implications for urban freight policies.",1361-9209,Not found
An e-scooter service region and fleet allocation design problem with elastic demand,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104153,130,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Despite the rapid growth of micromobility, and e-scooters in particular, there is no systematic approach for designing a contiguous service region with fleet allocation and responsive demand. We propose a non-rooted maximum weighted connected subgraph model with demand response to deal with this need, the first such model that does not require enumerating cycles or node pairs. The nonlinear demand response function is piecewise-linearized to obtain a mixed integer linear program and solved using an open-source solver, which is computationally efficient even for a Manhattan-sized study area with run times on the order of minutes for 318 zones. Two sets of experiments are conducted, the first on a 4-by-4 grid region to verify the model, and a second on the Manhattan region using realistic data. The results show that (1) there can exist thresholds where a strategy may switch from zone expansion to fleet expansion; and (2) reveals areas in Manhattan that should be avoided.",1361-9209,Not found
Shipping network vulnerability assessment integrated with geographical locations,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104166,130,2024-05-01,2024,5,"In maritime transport, ports undertake the routes and markets of surrounding ports after they fail during emergencies. The transfer and replacement of routes are subject to port-hinterland relationships, spatial agglomeration, and geopolitical environments, which are realistic expressions of port location from the perspectives of economy, geography, and geopolitics. However, the irreplaceability of ports influenced by geographic location has been ignored in previous evaluations of network vulnerability, which has exaggerated the network vulnerability. To address the aforementioned problems, an irreplaceability model based on the port’s geographical location was constructed. This model systematically simulates the changing trend of shipping network vulnerability and reveals the damage effect of the shipping network under the influence of emergencies to bring the vulnerability assessment results of shipping networks closer to reality.",1361-9209,Not found

This study examined the impact of vehicle weight on fuel consumption rate (FCR) by analyzing extensive, high-resolution operating data obtained from 162 heavy-duty trucks (HDTs). An engine output power-based (EOP) model, an artificial neural network (ANN) model, and a long short-term memory-convolutional (LSTM-Conv) model were developed and contrasted with conventional vehicle specific power (VSP) and Virginia Tech Microscopic (VT-Micro) models. The results indicated a significant, non-linear relationship between weight and FCR. Compared to 5-ton trucks, FCR for trucks weighing 15–25 tons and 45–55 tons increased by 290% and 755%, respectively, under low-speed and positive acceleration conditions. The LSTM-Conv model outperformed the VSP, VT-Micro, and EOP models, achieving MAPEs of 9.81% for FCR and 1.49% for trip fuel economy estimation.

The parameters are grouped into two scenarios, representative of the varying levels of route information available to a typical bus operator. A combination of feature selection methods was used to determine which characteristic parameters had the greatest influence on energy consumption. Regression based prediction models were developed, and models were then validated using standard and real vehicle drive cycles.

Causality between multi-scale built environment and rail transit ridership in Beijing and Tokyo,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104150,130,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Recent years have witnessed researchers' academic interests in the relationship between the built environment and rail transit ridership. However, few studies have analyzed it from a beyond-station scale and causal perspective. To fill this gap, this study uses Beijing and Tokyo as cases and utilizes Bayesian networks and generalized propensity score matching to achieve causal discovery and causal inference of built environment and ridership. Moreover, we innovatively consider the line-scale built environment factors. Evidence suggests that transit agencies should promote the overall accessibility of stations along the line to employment concentration areas more than single-station accessibility in Beijing. Meanwhile, the positive impact of bus-rail transit line cooperation on ridership is limited in Beijing. Planners should consider the capacity of rail transit lines. The causal inference results are mainly in line with previous correlation studies, but some interesting differences exist. For example, the net effect of dense pedestrian roads on ridership is negative, reminding policymakers that they should avoid expanding pedestrian paths without developing ridership-attracting resources. This study uses causal theories to emphasize the necessity of corridor-based and modest development.",1361-9209,Not found
Environmental impacts of ridesplitting considering modal substitution and associations with built environment,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104160,130,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Ridesplitting promises to reduce emissions. Previous studies mainly compared ridesplitting with single rides like taxis, leaving its impact on other modes unclear. This study quantifies the reduction or increase in CO 2 emissions due to ridesplitting from a modal substitution perspective and explore the nonlinear impacts of built environment factors on emission reductions. Considering different urban contexts, we choose Chengdu and Xi’an as representative examples for analysis. The results indicate that most ridesplitting trips lead to an increase in CO 2 emissions when compared to other modes. In Chengdu, a mere 8.92% of ridesplitting trips result in emission reduction, whereas in Xi’an, this figure stands at 4.68%. Emission reduction is predominantly linked to taxi substitution. Moreover, many built environment factors exhibit positive relationship with the increase in emission resulting from ridesplitting, and present nonlinear and threshold effects.

However, studies on estimating emissions from Irish HDV fleet are rare. This paper estimates fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from tractor-trailers that occupy nearly half of Ireland’s HDV fleet using the European Commission recommended VECTO tool. To improve the estimation accuracy, driving cycles specific to Irish road conditions were developed utilising real naturalistic driving data from trucks. The Irish driving cycles significantly differ from the VECTO inbuilt driving cycles in percentage time spent in different gears, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. CO2 emissions estimated with Irish driving cycles range from 733 to 1961 g/km, while with VECTO driving cycles, the values ranged from 728 to 1865 g/km. Further, the study evaluated the sensitivity towards payload, road gradient, and idling percentages.

Exposure to greenery during children's home–school walks: Socio-economic inequalities in alternative routes,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104162,130,2024-05-01,2024,5,"Children’s home–school walks are a perfect opportunity for green routes and active transportation. However, the availability of greenery along them likely varies among different socio-economic status (SES) groups. If low-SES children have less exposure to greenery than others during these walks, this might represent environmental injustice in transportation. We assess socio-environmental inequalities regarding children’s exposure to greenery in three alternative home–school routes: the shortest, simplest, and greenest. We used a mixed-method approach, linking viewshed analysis, space syntax and network analysis using multiple Lodz (Poland) datasets. Exposure to greenery along all three types of home–school routes is consistently lower for low-SES than high-SES children, signalling environmental injustice. In particular, even the greenest home–school routes of low-SES children are less green than the simplest and shortest ones of high-SES children.

The data are collected from a stated choice experiment and estimated via a hybrid choice model. The results show that i NIR is associated with a lower choice probability of HEV, ii NIR-dread is associated with a higher probability of choosing ICE vehicles, while skepticism about NIR is associated with a higher probability of choosing HEV, iii prompting positively or negatively framed information about NIR discourages HEV choice compared to providing no information.",1361-9209,Not found

Therefore, an improved method is proposed to determine the emissions specifically at berth with a modified bottom-up analysis that considers further geographical data, operating modes, berth-specific data, the new exclusion-area technique, and new cargo ship types. Also, the results of the proposed method applied in the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes showed that shore power policies can reduce up to an annual maximum of 227,061 t of carbon dioxide equivalent and 25 million dollars annually in external costs to society and governments.",1361-9209,Not found

Our findings reveal significant inequalities in PCS access across different neighborhoods under distance-based and opportunity-centric measures. However, a greater disparity exists when considering opportunities, with high-income communities having significantly better access to PCSs. Counterfactual analyses suggest that equitable deployment based on distance measures results in the least equitable outcomes when considering opportunities, primarily due to the existing disparity in opportunity distributions in our cities.

This research conducts city-scale fuel-sensitive routing simulations for two large metropolitan areas: the San Francisco Bay Area case and the Tokyo Area case. Combining agent-based simulations with data-driven fuel model, it is revealed that fuel-sensitive routing exerts heavier traffic on the local streets and increases residents’ direct exposure to traffic. Furthermore, by comparing different sub-areas, the varied degrees of traffic redistribution are found to be mainly dependent on the availability of major roads as alternative routes, and existing traffic congestion levels in an area.",1361-9209,Not found

However, in a ‘transfer hub’ model tractors deployed on urban legs can be electrified without using large batteries. Here, we assess the change in damages from air pollution from the introduction of automation and partial electrification in long haul trucking. For long haul routes below 300 miles, electrification reduces air pollution and greenhouse gas damages by 13% ($587 million annually).

By estimating the well-to-wheel emissions and total cost of ownership for internal combustion engine heavy-duty trucks, this study proposes the model of carbon-abatement benefit to conducting an environment-economic comparison of traditional diesel and potential alternative fuel. The results show that liquefied natural gas has better economic performance, with a cost 14.9% lower than diesel, and biodiesel reduces greenhouse gas emissions by more than 40% compared to diesel. Compared to other alternative fuels, liquefied natural gas has better carbon reduction benefits, with a carbon abatement value of 0.51 CNY/km. By 2040, all alternative fuels have positive carbon abatement values, ranging from 0.26 to 1.28 CNY/km.

Tracking early adoption of electric motorcycles: The mototaxi riders’ experience in Lomé,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104184,131,2024-06-01,2024,6,"Electric motorcycles have been growing rapidly in Africa in recent years. Using a combination of business models that reduce the price barrier, some electric motorcycle suppliers have succeeded in creating communities of users. Nevertheless, the available scientific literature provides little information on these early adopters, notably on their experiences and how these contribute to forging or not a sense of loyalty perceived through the willingness to recommend and/or repurchase these motorcycles. Drawing on the user experience (UX) curves method, this article fills this gap by interviewing 20 drivers of electric mototaxis in Lomé. The results reveal a mixed user experience. They show that the scaling of electric motorcycles in Lomé depends on the ability of suppliers to increase the satisfaction of early adopters by offering electric motorcycles and/or conditions of use at least equal to, if not superior to, those currently offered by gasoline-powered motorcycles.",1361-9209,Not found

Further, the influence of socio-demographic variables, travel attributes and latent factors on electric four-wheeler adoption behaviour is also evaluated. The findings indicate purchase price, operating cost, and charging time have a significant negative influence on the intention to adopt electric four-wheelers, while driving range and charging facilities have a significant positive impact. Perceived risks studied in the context of safety and reliability are found to be the biggest barriers to the adoption of electric vehicles followed by lack of infrastructural readiness while environmental benefits are found to be the biggest motivators for electric four-wheeler adoption. These findings are expected to help decision-makers towards widespread adoption of electric four-wheelers in developing economies such as India.",1361-9209,Not found
Resilience measurement and analysis of intercity public transportation network,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104202,131,2024-06-01,2024,6,"The resilience measurement of intercity public transportation networks is of great significance for the region’s safety and sustainability. This study discusses the topological and functional resilience of sub-networks and multi-modal network under different disruptions. Specifically, functional resilience is measured by comprehensively considering the service features of transportation modes. Additionally, the recovery priority of failed nodes to maximize network resilience is also discussed. The intercity coach/train timetable data and intercity travel data from the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration in China were applied to demonstrate the application of the methods. The results show that multi-modal network is more resilient to disruptions than sub-networks. According to the comparison, network functional resilience is more easily compromised and has less effectiveness on recovery than topological resilience.

The framework considers both direct and indirect impacts of port disruptions on GLSN performance in TC scenarios. We demonstrate this framework through case studies under historical and stress-test TC scenarios in the Western North Pacific region. Results show that the GLSN can be quite resilient in typical or mild-stress scenarios, but the increasing decline in its resilience under higher stress levels signals significant risks when facing with extreme scenarios. Those least resilient countries under mild stress turn out to be the same countries exhibiting least resilience under severe stress, most of which are SIDS countries.

Eco-driving control for CAVs at signalized intersections: Adapting to traffic uncertainties,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104270,132,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Eco-driving control for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) presents significant energy-saving potential by enabling smooth, non-stop travel through signalized intersections. This study addresses the challenge of traffic uncertainties under congestion conditions, which often lead to trajectory planning errors and increased energy consumption. We propose a hierarchical eco-driving approach for CAVs that incorporates both upper-layer trajectory planning and lower-layer velocity control. The upper layer employs a dynamic programming-based model for time-based optimal eco-driving reference trajectory planning, focusing on objectives of energy efficiency and high mobility. In the lower layer, a model predictive control (MPC)-based two-mode velocity controller is formulated to adeptly handle infeasible or unreasonable reference trajectories. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing strategies, achieving average improvements of 3.99% in CO 2 emissions, 3.65% in fuel consumption, and 2.61% in vehicle mobility. We suggest that a comprehensive evaluation framework for eco-driving performance of CAVs should be established with respect to diverse traffic conditions, regulating CAV market entry from an environmental perspective.",1361-9209,Not found

Although studies have explored the role of objective visual features (e.g., greenery), few have addressed that of perceived visual qualities (e.g., enclosure). Using ∼ 5,000 Lime trips, we found both objective visual features and subjective perceptions significantly affect DBS traffic in understudied small cities like Ithaca. Wider and open streets with higher visual complexity, human scale, and safety attract DBS users, consistent with docked bikeshare and personal bike findings. Conversely, streets characterized by higher enclosure, and excessive obstructions (e.g., cars and grass) deter cyclists.

Economic feasibility of LNG-fuelled river ships: Carbon tax schemes perspective,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104235,132,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Inland waterway transportation, with its advantages of large volume and low cost, holds tremendous potential for driving national or regional economic development. Meanwhile, it generates huge emissions through the use of traditional petroleum fuels. To accelerate green shipping growth, employing green energy-powered river ships and implementing policies have become urgent tasks. We construct a novel voyage cost model based on navigation characteristics and investigate the economic feasibility of LNG-fuelled river ships under two proposed carbon tax schemes (fixed vs. progressive). Taking the Yangtze River as an example, we analyze the shipping cost in three transportation systems-bulk cargo, container, and dangerous goods. The results indicate: (1) LNG-fuelled river ships with appropriate deadweight tonnage and deployment on longer routes exhibit favorable economic performance. (2) Progressive carbon tax scheme performs better than fixed one in promoting green shipping. (3) Carbon tax policies should be formulated based on different routes, ship types and sizes.",1361-9209,Not found
The effect of LNG bunkering on port competitiveness using multilevel data analysis,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104240,132,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Environmental practices can enable most businesses, including ports, to gain a competitive advantage. Given the chicken-and-egg dilemma for the adoption of alternative fuels in the shipping industry, this article assesses whether and to what extent ports have incentives to provide liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering infrastructure. More specifically, we test whether such facilities positively affect the competitiveness of the ports, which would be an additional incentive to drive the transition to alternative fuels. Using multilevel regressions and propensity score matching on LNG-fueled vessel movements in the Baltic Sea Region in 2019, we found no significant effect of LNG bunkering infrastructure on port competitiveness, measured by port choice probabilities expressed by vessels. Although our findings indicate that ports do not gain a competitive advantage in the short-term, we do not rule out potential gains in the long-term. Policy intervention is desirable in the short-term to maintain incentives for port investments.",1361-9209,Not found
Equity in non-motorist safety: Exploring two pathways in Houston,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104239,132,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Equity is of significant concern in roadway safety research, but existing research often overlooks confounding factors from roadway environment and traffic exposure. In this research, we apply a structural equation model approach to explore the underlying mechanism of disparity in non-motorist crashes in Houston, Texas by examining the mediating effect of two transportation modes, motor vehicle transportation and active transportation. The results suggest that disadvantaged neighborhoods tend to have a positive direct and total effect on non-motorist crashes. Mediating analysis shows denser roadway environments and higher vehicular exposure could indirectly contribute to such disparity, while inadequate active transportation infrastructure and active transportation exposure might mitigate non-motorist crash risk to some extent. This research offers conceptual insights for urban and transportation planners to consider equity in roadway safety practices and supporting evidence for providing active transportation infrastructure and mitigating traffic exposure in disadvantaged communities to improve transportation equity.",1361-9209,Not found
Operational cycles for maritime transportation: Consolidated methodology and assessments,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104238,132,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Operational cycles for maritime transportation is a new concept to improve the assessment of ships’ energy efficiency and offer benchmarking options among similar ship types and sizes. This work extends previous research to consolidate the methodology, bring more comprehensiveness, and provide a more holistic assessment of these operational cycles. The cycles are designed from noon reports from a fleet of around 300 container ships divided into eight size groups. The comparison between cycles derived from speed and draft with those based on main engine power identifies that the cycles based on speed and draft are more accurate and allow for estimating the Energy Efficiency Operational Index but require more data. The main-engine-power cycles are more effective in benchmarking through the Annual Efficiency Ratio. These cycles reduce the inherent variability of the carbon intensity indicator and present good opportunities as a benchmarking tool for strengthening the regulatory framework of international shipping.",1361-9209,Not found
Short-term and long-term impacts of shared autonomous vehicle choice behavior,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104221,132,2024-07-01,2024,7,"Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) is an emerging travel mode that can reduce parking spaces and accelerate urban sprawl. The time–space varying demand leads to the imbalance between travel demand and vehicle supply. Using pricing to affect clients’ mode choice is a key method for addressing the imbalance problem, which includes long-term pricing and short-term allowance. Hence, in this paper, we propose an innovative method to enhance the SAV utilization rate while considering stochastic demand: fixed price on population mode choice and real-time allowance on personal departure time choice. A mixed integer nonlinear program is formulated to maximize the total profits of SAV operators. To solve this model, a customized gradient search algorithm is proposed. A case study is conducted in Suzhou Industrial Park, China.

Based on 1,044 respondents in Shanghai, China, we applied an extreme gradient boosting model to examine associations of the built environment with commuting satisfaction, adjusted by commuting characteristics and sociodemographics. Results show the built environment around workplaces is more important than that around residences. Workplace land use diversity promotes commuting satisfaction, while residential land use diversity reduces it. Around both residences and workplaces, areas of green spaces reduce commuting satisfaction and population density has inversed U-shaped associations with commuting satisfaction. Moreover, the effects of green spaces and land use diversity around workplaces are diminished by those around residences; while the effects of population density around workplaces are strengthened by those around residences.

Real-world vehicle tailpipe emissions, internally observable variables, dynamic and location data were measured along six conventional roundabouts in Portugal (1 Hz resolution). Although the multilane roundabout yielded the lowest amounts of carbon dioxide, it resulted in highly volatile behaviors based on vehicular jerk thresholds. The emission hotspots were found downstream roundabouts while drivers tend to adopt highly volatile behaviors close to the circulatory roadway.

Decarbonising shared mobility: The potential of shared electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104313,133,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Car-sharing services offer potential to reduce dependency on private cars, and their electrification may decarbonise the transportation sector even further. This study estimates the potential emission reduction if shared cars operated by GoCar- a car-sharing service in Ireland- are electrified and assesses which trips could be completed using shared electric vehicles (EVs). Based on historical and targeted growth scenarios, appropriate forecasting methods were explored to predict GoCar’s fleet size and travel distance for 2030. The corresponding emissions were estimated using COPERT. Results showed that electrifying half of the GoCar fleet by 2030 can reduce total emissions by up to 45% compared with baseline, whereas emissions were elevated by 50% compared to 2021 fleet operations. Results also suggest that the majority (70% to 90%) of GoCar day bookings can be completed using the available EVs in the Irish market, indicating the feasibility of EVs in car-sharing services.",1361-9209,Not found

Using a primary data collected in Hubli-Dharwad city in Southern India, the paper estimates Spatial Durbin models to assess the direct and spillover effects of socio-economic characteristics (household income, the number of children and household size), built environment characteristics (population density, diversity, distance, and subjective built environment measures), travel attitudes (pro-car, pro-NMT and pro-public transport), and commute behavior (distance and time) on household car and motorcycle ownership. The paper finds that spatial dependencies exist in both aggregate and disaggregate levels of analysis. There is a significant spatial dependency in car ownership due to household income, household size, the number of children, and pro-car attitude, and the correlations are significant in both aggregate and disaggregate levels of analysis. The positive lag effects of these variables suggests that socio-economic settings and attitudes of neighboring wards affect car and motorcycle ownership in a ward. The effects of diversity on car and motorcycle ownership maintain similar correlations in both levels of analysis. The likelihood of motorcycle ownership increases with improvements in diversity, while car ownership likelihood decreases.

Tailoring climate mitigation strategies for passenger transportation by capturing contextual heterogeneity in TIMES-Sweden,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104310,133,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Meeting ambitious climate targets requires deep cuts in emissions from passenger transportation. Many studies point to electrification and behavioural shifts as key measures. Spatial, demographic, economic, and transport-sector-related factors shape the opportunities and preferences for change, thus setting the direction and pace of the transition. These factors typically differ between urban, suburban and low-population-density settings, a fact that is generally overlooked in comprehensive energy system optimisation models (ESOM). This study introduces a novel contextual representation of passenger transportation within a national ESOM (TIMES-Sweden). When testing the new approach, different cost barriers to electrification are found across various settings, signalling a need for different policy responses. Further, opportunities for – and impact from – shifts in travel behaviours vary significantly across settings.

To address this issue, a new multilevel road waterlogging assessment model based on four spatial scales and four assessment indices was developed. Then, a road waterlogging information acquisition method was designed based on flood models (FMs) and spatial analysis methods, and existing multihierarchical road network models (RNMs) were extended to integrate road waterlogging information. Next, with a typical region selected as the study area, road waterlogging information under specific rainstorm scenarios was acquired and analyzed with the FMs and RNMs. Then, a multilevel assessment of road waterlogging and various analyses were conducted.

Observing expenditure items charged to the mobility budget, we test if social comparisons and a climate-related moral appeal induce a shift towards low-emissions transport modes. We find that simultaneous application of both nudges causes a reduction in car use, particularly taxi and ride sharing, as well as substitution towards micromobility, but not public transport. The social comparison alone is not effective, and the treatment effects of the combined nudge vanish in the second half of the treatment period.

Results indicate government targets can be met, but only as a result of multiple interventions. Modal shifting of medium-length car journeys and private car electrification are predicted to be the most effective interventions for emissions reduction, although these measures alone do not attain reduction targets. Results further indicate that realising the reduction in car kilometres does not guarantee the emissions target will also be achieved.",1361-9209,Not found

Over the decades, wildfires have emerged as a pressing concern due to their increased frequency and intensity, yet the relationship between wildfire smoke and public transportation usage remains largely unexplored. Leveraging high-resolution daily wildfire-driven PM2.5 concentration estimates and station-level Metrorail ridership data in the Washington Metropolitan Area spanning 2012–2019, we examine the effects of wildfire smoke exposure on Metrorail usage. We find that wildfire smoke exposure results in a 0.8% increase in Metrorail ridership on weekdays and a more pronounced 3.7% rise on weekends. Additionally, we show a stronger response in Metrorail ridership to wildfire smoke during off-peak hours compared to peak hours, with the most substantial increase observed during the winter. Our heterogeneity analysis further suggests that a lack of vehicle ownership and higher reliance on walking and public transportation are key factors leading to increased Metrorail ridership.

Using the lens of ‘mobilities paradigm’ and analysing policy documents along with interviews data from government officials, the findings reveal the complexity of governing AVs transition due to fragmented responsibility, contested visions, and high interdependency across government agencies. The findings suggest that strong political leadership coupled with infrastructure investments and building regulators’ capability are important catalysts of change towards AVs transition in NZ. The paper concludes that the complex governance environment, and the central government action and inaction to set priority for the AVs agenda, may hinder or facilitate a smooth transition towards AVs in NZ. This paper contributes to the mobilities paradigm by enriching our understanding of the political-institutional challenges associated with the emergence of AVs and offers illuminating policy guidance to better inform decision-making around governing the future transition towards AVs.",1361-9209,Not found
Temperature shocks and low-carbon performance: Evidence from the transportation sector in China,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104282,133,2024-08-01,2024,8,"This study identifies how temperature affects the transportation sector’s low-carbon performance, measured by carbon total factor productivity (CTFP). The findings reveal that an additional day with temperatures surpassing 30 °C results in a 0.25 % decrease in CTFP compared to days ranging from 15 °C to 20 °C. The mechanism analysis indicates that high temperatures primarily reduce CTFP by undermining technical efficiency, especially in reducing energy- and carbon-oriented technical efficiency. To combat heat stress, the transportation sector markedly increases the proportion of coal and oil consumption, thus shifting its energy structure towards a more carbon-intensive configuration. The heterogeneous analysis uncovers that the adverse impacts of high temperatures are more pronounced in transportation sectors located in the eastern region, in those that are energy- and labor-intensive, and in those heavily reliant on road transport. Moreover, we find that high-speed railways can effectively mitigate the negative impacts of high temperatures.",1361-9209,Not found

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating Dublin’s e-bike sharing system, comprising 12 stations (eHUBs). Using six months of real-world riding data, it employs data envelopment analysis to assess the eco-efficiency of each eHUB in utilising nearby infrastructure, population in the catchment area, and location to achieve desired economic, social, and environmental outputs. Results indicate an upward trajectory for the system’s eco-efficiency. The returns-to-scale analysis provides insights into the system’s scalability, suggesting that expanding the e-bike sharing system, along with infrastructural enhancements, would significantly increase ridership. Analysing decarbonisation, usage patterns, and spatial factors of eHUBs reveals the substantial potential of shared e-bikes if optimally used.

Towards decarbonization: How EEXI and CII regulations affect container liner fleet deployment,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104277,133,2024-08-01,2024,8,"This study examines the effects of two pivotal maritime regulations, namely the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), implemented by the IMO starting from 2023, on the container-fleet deployment. A mixed-integer programming model is formulated to optimize the fleet deployment with considering the constraints of the above-mentioned regulations and the goal of minimizing operating costs. The findings reveal that the CII regulation leads to a substantial decrease in both ship speeds and carbon emissions concurrently, although there may be an uptick in the number of deployed ships. Conversely, the EEXI has a minor effect on speeds due to the prevalence of slow steaming. Based on research findings, several policy implications are elucidated for shipowners.",1361-9209,Not found
Long-term mobility choice considering availability effects of shared and new mobility services,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104274,133,2024-08-01,2024,8,"E-bikes, shared and new mobility services such as Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) are emerging as sustainable and healthy alternatives to private cars, introducing complexities in household mobility decisions and potential substitution between transportation modes and services. However, existing studies primarily examined the potential long-term adoption of these emerging mobilities separately, leaving a gap in understanding the interplay among various emerging mobilities and conventional cars. This study therefore addresses this portfolio choice incorporating a stated portfolio choice experiment, encompassing pedelecs, speed pedelecs, MaaS, Shared e-Mobilities, and electric and conventional cars. Results from a random effects error component mixed logit model, based on an online survey conducted in the Netherlands, indicate significant availability effects of shared and new mobility services on personal mobility ownership decisions, and a substantial demand for pedelecs.

Nevertheless, it is debatable concerning CAV implementation as an eco-driving strategy, given that large-scale deployment has not yet been realized and studies relevant to emission reduction have yielded inconsistent results. Our study investigates the effects of implementing CAVs on emission reduction and focuses on passenger reactions regarding vehicular platooning. We employ microsimulation to examine the environmental effects associated with different levels of CAV penetration, complemented by a VR experiment that evaluates rider adherence to CAV systems. The findings indicate that higher CAV penetration rates and greater passenger compliance contribute to reductions in vehicle emissions, yet there is a concurrent rise in PM10 levels when the fleet size exceeds seven vehicles.

Should transit-oriented development consider station age effects?,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104273,133,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Promoting transit-oriented development (TOD) through the built environment and transport interventions is an essential planning strategy for achieving urban sustainable objectives. Yet, existing studies largely neglect the critical effects of station age on the relationship between the built environment and metro ridership. This study fills this gap by examining how the impact of the built environment on metro ridership varies by station age in Shanghai, China. We apply machine learning methods to identify key determinants of metro ridership and examine nonlinear associations across three station age intervals. The results suggest: (1) the effects of the built environment and metro ridership are not homogeneous among different station ages; (2) the transport-related built environment factors contribute more to metro ridership at the early stage period, while the land use-related built environment variables more profound at latter stages. These insights provide planners with stage-specific guidance on tailoring built environment interventions for TOD.",1361-9209,Not found
Establishing carbon footprints for modular integrated construction logistics using cyber-physical internet routers,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104259,133,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Modular integrated construction (MiC) logistics is controversial regarding carbon emissions due to the increased weight of shipped modules.

Autonomous vehicle impacts on airport leakage with demand forecasting and environment implications,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104268,133,2024-08-01,2024,8,"Changing preferences due to autonomous vehicles may cause air travelers to forgo their local airports in favor of more preferred air service at large-hub, typically farther, airports in a phenomenon known as airport leakage. This dynamic (re)distribution of demand may impact roadway congestion and further worsen aviation’s impact on the environment due to hub congestion. Hence, we provide an approach to estimate how future changes in passenger behavior due to autonomous vehicles could impact airport leakage. Our model leverages airport leakage estimation methods and Diffusion of Innovation theory to incorporate autonomous vehicles as an airport access mode. We apply our method to the U.S. megaregions featuring Charlotte, NC and Atlanta, GA and highlight the role of autonomous vehicle adoption on airport leakage patterns and long-term airport demand forecasts over time.

Results indicate significant effects of these variables on CO2 emission rates, with a strong positive correlation between vehicle speed, road slope, and CO2 emissions. CO2 emission rates substantially increase when vehicle acceleration exceeds five m/s.

CO2 emissions are estimated using emission factors, distance traveled, and the projected commercial vehicle population. We use the validated forecasting model to investigate how emissions can be curbed through vehicle scrappage policies or fleet electrification to realign with the 2015 Paris Agreement’s targets. Compared to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, 10-year and 15-year vehicle scrappage policies are estimated to reduce freight emissions by 6–11% and 1–2%, respectively. Fleet electrification has more pronounced effects as it results in a 35% and 70% reduction in carbon emissions for heavy and light goods vehicles in 2050, respectively, compared to the BAU scenario.

Building on governance and governmentality theories we provide a comparative analysis of the management of COVID-19 and climate change by the Swedish state in relation to individual mobility and transport. We find that the governance approach in the two cases differ significantly, with a unified state response to COVID-19 being based on a perception of acute crisis combined with solidarity appeals to citizens. In contrast, climate change is marked by a distributed network governance, a conceptualisation of future crisis, and individuals being invoked primarily as economic agents.

Nonetheless, these networks are susceptible to disruptive influences such as natural disasters. In response to such disruptions, decision-makers must undertake efficient allocation of recovery projects to restore to a pre-disruption state. With simultaneous project restorations, we consider the concurrent restoration process as a discrete dynamical system and construct a restoration network (R-Net), where a unique project allocation is represented as a path from the source node to the sink node. Upon the R-Net, the restoration sequence along with project allocation is optimized by solving a minimum-cost flow problem. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the network flow approach, and the findings indicate that an increase in the number of recovery projects and a decrease in recovery resources lead to a notable expansion of the R-Net scale.",1361-9209,Not found

In this study, eight low-cost acoustic sensors (AudioMoth) were used to evaluate the effect of a LTN intervention on urban noise in a residential area of Oxford, UK. The acoustic energy and LAeq of the noise is evaluated before and after the introduction of the LTN at locations where traffic filters have been erected, other locations in the LTN, possible displacement locations, and a control location. In addition, source apportionment (anthropogenic or biotic) is undertaken using the Normalised Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI) using the frequency of the measured noise. The results show that in terms of acoustic energy almost all locations experienced a reduction in noise after the introduction of the LTN. In terms of the source apportionment, all locations except for the control location experienced more biotic noise after the introduction of the LTN.

This study uses data from a 2017 activity-travel survey in Shanghai to examine the relationship between rail accessibility and residents’ life satisfaction in central urban and suburban areas with different travel abilities. It finds that both residential location and travel ability influence the impact of rail accessibility on life satisfaction. There are differences in the thresholds for rail accessibility among residents with different residential locations and private car ownership. These findings suggest that rail transit is a powerful tool for promoting the well-being in developing countries, and proper planning of rail station siting and land use is needed.",1361-9209,Not found
"Environmental and health impacts of banning passenger cars with internal combustion engines: A case study of Leeds, UK",10.1016/j.trd.2024.104343,134,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Governments worldwide are considering banning the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to address environmental and public health issues. However, the environmental and health impacts of banning ICEV sales remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the effects of banning ICEV sales under various implementation timelines on PM2.5 and NOx emissions in Leeds, UK, and the associated premature deaths, using a novel ’Fleet-Emission-Health’ model. The results showed that the earlier ban on ICEV sales led to an almost 100% reduction in NOx by 2040, whereas total PM2.5 increased slightly due to more non-exhaust PM2.5 emissions emitted from battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Moreover, banning ICEV sales in 2030 would avoid 28 deaths in Leeds in 2040 compared to those in 2022, due to the reduction of NOx and PM2.5 emissions from ICEV exhaust. The findings indicate that stricter regulations on non-exhaust emissions are necessary to mitigate environmental and public health effects.",1361-9209,Not found

Carbon footprint impacts arising from disruptions to container shipping networks,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104335,134,2024-09-01,2024,9,"This study employed complex network theory to assess the carbon footprint impacts of disruptions to container shipping networks (CSN). Connectivity and performance metrics are analysed and the environmental impact of disruptions in key nodes calculated by applying well-to-wake (WTW) carbon footprint estimation. A CSN along the Asia-Europe route, encompassing the Suez Canal, was selected to examine the environmental impact following on from disruption. The findings highlight that the disruption affected all strings in the CSN, the average degree of the network, graph density and clustering coefficient decreased by 11%, 10% and 3.5% respectively, and network diameter increased. The increase in diameter signifies that ships are rerouted to alternative paths (especially around the Cape of Good Hope) thus necessitating longer distances. In turn total WTW emissions increased by 48.6%.

Meta-analysis of consumers’ trade-offs between range and charging infrastructure for electric vehicles,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104342,134,2024-09-01,2024,9,"The failure of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) to provide sufficiently long ranges in a relatively short charging time (as compared with conventional vehicles) is one of the main technical barriers to consumers’ adoption of these vehicles. However, this technical barrier could be mitigated if consumers were willing to trade-off lower ranges with better charging infrastructure. This paper analyses trade-offs individuals are willing to make between range and en-route charging station availability when considering the purchase of BEVs. By means of a meta-regression analysis of 33 stated preference studies, we find that consumers are willing to accept compensations for lower ranges in form of more dense charging infrastructure in their BEV purchase decision, but only when BEV ranges are longer than 250–300 km. This result is very relevant to promote the transition to BEVs because it shows that, in some circumstances, a significant technical barrier can be overcome with infrastructure investments.",1361-9209,Not found
Climate change concern as driver of sustainable mobility and reduced car use,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104345,134,2024-09-01,2024,9,"Climate change concern has been linked to climate-friendly behavior, but little is known on whether and how it may promote sustainable mobility.

Findings indicate a relationship between worry about climate change and reduced car use, mediated by mode preferences and willingness to live car-free. Those concerned about climate change were less likely to commute by a conventional car and used conventional cars less both on weekdays and weekends. Worry about climate change was also related to living in a denser neighborhood, preference for travel modes other than the car, and willingness to live car-free. Raising greater awareness of climate change could contribute to climate change mitigation by promoting car-reduced or car-free lifestyles and sustainable mobility.",1361-9209,Not found

This work proposes to bridge the gap by integrating OBM data with remote sensing data to create a comprehensive monitoring system. OBM data detail NOx emissions under various driving conditions and remote sensing data are employed to identify high-emitters through established thresholds. A case study in Chengdu, focusing on construction waste transport vehicles (a.k.a. slag trucks), indicates that the current national threshold might be too lenient. Implementing this method could reduce NOx emissions by 18.8% among China V slag trucks if all high-emitters have been repaired.

The level of behavior-preference dissonance (i.e., non-alignment), various travel needs (e.g., safety, environment, cost), and sociodemographic variables are considered covariates. Results uncover seven distinct mobility classes ranging from current (un)sustainable use (behavior) to (un)sustainable future preferences. There is a noticeable preference for electric vehicles (EVs), while autonomous vehicles are less popular.

This study focuses on assessing the impacts of driving speed and mudflap types on particle resuspension in the wake of a passenger vehicle traveling on a dust-contaminated road. To this end, fixed and mobile measurements are taken simultaneously to assess particle dispersion after each vehicle passage. The results show that driving at 30 km/h without a mudflap is the best configuration to reduce particle resuspension, while the use of a long transverse mudflap is the worst solution.

A model is tailored to incorporate a broader range of real-world factors into complex network modelling than adopted previously, including physical URTS network features, plausible flood disruption scenarios, and resourcing for recovery. The results of the London URTS case study suggest that the loss of satisfied travel demand is approximately 1.8 million, 4.2 million, and 7.2 million for the 30-year, 100-year, and 1000-year floods, leading to anticipated revenue loss of £3.1 million, £6.8 million, and £11.4 million, respectively (subject to modelling assumptions). This study highlights that the popular normalised resilience index can capture system performance loss but not necessarily recovery time: this matters when there is a long tail to the recovery process.

To do that, the lines are described by stations, and the relations between lines are defined by train scheduling data. Then, we use the passenger volume and travel time cost between lines to assess HSRLN’s vulnerability with disasters’ spatio-temporal characteristics. Finally, the HSRLN in China is taken as a case.

Rainfall runoff response characteristics of typical urban roads based on laboratory tests,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104402,135,2024-10-01,2024,10,"Aiming to address the lack of available and accurate runoff coefficients of various roads in urban flooding simulations and effectiveness assessments of permeable pavement on runoff reduction, the rainfall-runoff response characteristics of typical urban road pavements were investigated by laboratory-scaled tests. The results showed that average runoff coefficients and initial runoff times of pervious road pavements were almost 0.1 ∼ 0.2 and 7 ∼ 20 times those of impervious pavements, respectively. Moreover, permeable brick (PB) pavement presented better capacity for runoff mitigation than permeable asphalt concrete (PAC) pavement when the average rainfall intensity was 1.11 or 1.80 mm/min. The average runoff coefficient of cement concrete (CC) pavement ranged from 0.939 to 0.985 under all rainfall intensity and longitudinal slope combinations, while that of asphalt concrete (AC) was between 0.907 and 0.961.

However, wage growth and access to company cars are also positively correlated. Therefore, we cannot interpret the difference in the number of cars between the treatment and control groups as a causal effect of the company car scheme, but as a correlation. Still, existing evidence on the income elasticity of car demand suggests that the increase in the number of cars is unlikely to be driven by wage growth alone.",1361-9209,Not found

For example, the increase in the lowest temperature motivates middle-school students to choose active travel modes and cars. Humidity exceeding 50% is negatively correlated with the percentage of students walking. Increased PM2.5 concentration benefits the percentage of bike use but negatively affects public transport use. Moreover, O3 concentration has a V-shaped effect on walking and car use, which is the opposite of bike and public transport.

The results reveal that using standard cycles generally results in an underestimation of fuel consumption by 20 % to 30 %, which highlights the necessity of developing specific driving cycles to ensure accurate fuel use and emission quantification for garbage trucks.",1361-9209,Not found
Environmental life-cycle impacts of bitumen: Systematic review and new Canadian models,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104439,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Bitumen − or asphalt binder − is a major contributor to pavement environmental impacts. Nevertheless, the literature only counts scarce asphalt binder LCAs, with highly variable results. To better understand bitumen environmental impacts, we review LCAs published before 2024. Then, we build bitumen LCA models for different Canadian markets, using TRACI 2.1 and ecoinvent v3.6. The carbon footprint of Canadian asphalt binders ranges within [826–1098] kgCO2eq/t (potentially up to 2680 kgCO2eq/t when including fugitive emissions). Crude oil extraction is the main contributor to most life cycle environmental impact categories, but likely still underestimated. Transportation impacts can vary highly ([18–291] kgCO2eq/t in Canada). Models for these two hotspots must be tailored. Finally, we critically compare the carbon footprints of all published virgin asphalt binders LCAs: previous carbon footprints range within [143–637] kgCO2eq/t and are very likely underestimated. Previous pavement LCA results must be questioned, and higher-quality LCIs urgently developed to produce robust regionalized LCA-based recommendations on pavement green practices.",1361-9209,Not found
Has the low sulfur strategy benefited the maritime supply chain?,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104448,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Owing to the IMO 2020 low sulfur regulation, shipping carriers have adopted either very low-sulfur fuels or scrubbers, altering their cost structures and competitiveness. This study examines the regulation’s impact on low sulfur strategies by building game theory model of two carriers under scenarios with and without the regulation. The results reveal that while the regulation can disadvantage shippers, it potentially benefits carriers and fuel suppliers. However, in low-competition contexts, the carrier without slow steaming might struggle due to the low sulfur requirement, thus minimizing shipper losses. The research aims for an equilibrium low sulfur strategy, uncovering that speed does not always enhance market share or profits. Utilizing scrubbers achieves Pareto efficiency, avoiding the prisoner’s dilemma present in other strategies. Furthermore, the optimal equilibrium may enhance maritime supply chain benefits, emphasizing the importance of strategic low sulfur adoption and regulatory compliance for sustainable competitive advantage.",1361-9209,Not found
Decarbonising Swedish maritime transport: Scenario analyses of climate policy instruments,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104457,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"To analyse the future transition towards fossil-free fuels in the Swedish maritime transport sector, this study develops a scenario modelling tool to assess implications of policy instruments, such as the European Union Emissions Trading System and the FuelEU Maritime regulation. Using data for individual ships and their operational patterns, the model estimates the lowest-cost fuel option for shipowners in different scenarios and calculates the resulting annual fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Scenario analyses indicate that policy instruments have the potential to affect shipowners’ investment choices, but that relatively strong price signals are required for significant effects to arise. Battery-electric propulsion is most common for passenger ferries, ropax ships, and small passenger cruises, while fishing vessels and service ships typically choose conventional fuels across all scenarios. Choices are found to vary between ship segments and scenarios, emphasising the need to consider ship-specific data when analysing effects of policy instruments.",1361-9209,Not found
Enhancing transit-oriented development sustainability through the integrated node-place-ecology (NPE) model,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104456,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) offers a strategic approach to enhance urban environmental sustainability.

Reducing automobile commuting in inner-city and suburban: Integrating land-use and management intervention,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104460,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Few studies have examined how demand-side management measures, alone or in conjunction with built environment interventions, affect car owners’ automobile commuting choices in developing cities. Additionally, most studies overlook the difference between inner-cities and suburbs. Applying extreme gradient boosting decision trees and shapley method to the 2020 Wuhan travel survey data, this study addresses these gaps. Transportation management measures and the built environment individually exert a significant impact on car commuting, while jointly exhibiting synergistic effects on car commuting. Meanwhile, most of these effects are nonlinear and exhibit different properties in the inner-city and suburbs. In the inner-city, proximity to central development and population densification can reduce automobile commuting. Parking fees and transit allowances enhance these benefits. For suburbs, job densification and mixed development are more effective, but have limited impact on the inner city. This study demonstrated that integrating built environment interventions with management measures enhances policy effectiveness.",1361-9209,Not found

We developed a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) to estimate e-scooter sharing usage using ridesourcing trips along with associated built environment and socio-demographic variables. The model was interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Results indicated that the threshold effects, where the positive relationship between e-scooter sharing and ridesourcing significantly weakened beyond a certain value, were more pronounced in areas with lower population density, fewer jobs, and fewer young, highly educated population. This is primarily attributed to the limited competitiveness of e-scooter sharing in these areas.

We present a novel framework to integrate public transport and paratransit at the tactical planning level. We formulate this integration as a two-step Transit Network Frequency Setting Problem (TNFSP). The first step of TNFSP involves a headway-based network-wide multi-modal transit assignment, followed by an integrated frequency optimisation in the second step. The proposed approach is applied to the network of Visakhapatnam, a medium-sized Indian city with 9 % and 18 % share of paratransit and formal transit. After validating the base model using real-world data, we perform scenario-based analysis to derive the optimal fleet size, network configuration, and frequency of both systems to minimise externalities.

Home sending emerged as the favourite (52%) for its convenience, while garage parking was chosen by 36%, valued for security and environmental benefits. Cruising was least popular (6%), deterred by environmental concerns. Integrating survey data with traffic simulations, the research uncovered that cruising, despite its low preference, accounted for 16% of energy consumption due to empty trips. Surprisingly, sending AVs home, despite being the most popular, led to significant energy use, although it maintained a good consumption ratio.

This study aims to provide detailed insights on how people adjust and change their activity-travel and time use behaviors in the face of extreme heat conditions.By leveraging time use records integrated with weather data, the study compares activity-mobility patterns between extreme heat days and non-extreme days. A series of models are estimated to understand the impact of extreme heat even after controlling for other variables. The findings reveal that heat significantly impacts time use and activity-mobility patterns, with some groups exhibiting potentially greater vulnerability arising from the inability to adapt sufficiently to extreme heat. Designing dense, shaded urban environments, declaring heat days to facilitate indoor stays, and providing transportation vouchers for vulnerable populations can help mitigate the ill-effects of extreme heat.",1361-9209,Not found
Taking the wheel: Systematic review of reviews of policies driving BEV adoption,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104424,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This study is motivated by the need to understand what the most appropriate policies are to promote battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in various countries around the world. A systematic review of reviews on policies promoting BEVs was conducted to synthesise knowledge on the relative effectiveness of various policies. This study addresses three limitations in existing research on policies to promote electric vehicles (EVs). Firstly, it disentangles findings for BEVs from that of other EVs. Secondly, it examines the relative effectiveness of these policies to find optimal policy mixes. Finally, it compares policy effectiveness across nations at various stages of economic development and EV adoption. Purchase subsidies and tax incentives were found to be highly effective policies to kickstart EV adoption but may not be as effective at later stages of the EV adoption and may not be an affordable policy for all countries. Some countries that led the way with such subsidies and tax incentives have now begun curtailing or ceasing them, and contrary to earlier reviews, without serious adverse effect on adoption rates. Policies supporting public charging infrastructure are crucial enablers that complement EV purchase subsidies but are important even without purchase subsidies in place. High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane access and toll waivers are the next most effective demand side policies, but only in cities where such incentives make sense and cents for consumers. Supply side policies, such as zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates and vehicle emissions standards, must match or precede demand side policies to avoid bottlenecks and effectively drive uptake of BEVs in the earliest stage of adoption.",1361-9209,Not found
Impact of vehicle-to-everything connectivity on fuel economy,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104423,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Zero-emission powertrains, connectivity, and automation are the future of automotive mobility, though their collective impacts on fuel economy is difficult to study. This paper develops a novel methodology to simulate the impacts of cooperative driving automation on battery electric (BEVs) and fuel-cell electric (FCEVs) vehicles. Enabling V2I connectivity for city driving resulted in fuel economy improvement of 6 % to 13 % for BEVs and 9 % to 15 % for FCEVs. Enabling aerodynamic drag reduction in V2V highway driving resulted in fuel economy improvement of 5 % to 32 % for BEVs and 5 % to 26 % for FCEVs. Sensitivity analysis on battery and fuel cell efficiency was conducted to determine how technological improvements could impact connected mobility. Improving powertrain component efficiencies decreased performance gains for V2I city driving while increasing performance gains for V2V highway driving. Fuel-cell efficiency improvements had greater impacts on connectivity gains than battery efficiency improvements. Vehicle testing should verify these results.",1361-9209,Not found
Risk substance identification of asphalt VOCs integrating machine learning and network pharmacology,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104434,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Asphalt releases volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during paving processes, posing risks to workers and the environment. The complex composition of asphalt and the evolving of VOCs present challenges in accurately assessing their potential environmental and health impacts using traditional experimental approaches. This study aimed to develop a robust computational framework integrating machine learning and network pharmacology to predict the risks from the asphalt VOCs. The results show that the MACCS+XGBoost model achieved the highest predictive performance, with an accuracy of 0.85, balanced accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.83, specificity of 0.84, and F1-score of 0.84 in the external validation.

Real-time logistics transport emission monitoring-Integrating artificial intelligence and internet of things,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104426,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"The lack of a globally recognized measurement technique combined with a limited ability to comprehend the actual level of GHG emissions in intricate logistics operations causes significant obstacles for firms in assessing the magnitude of their environmental footprint. Nevertheless, linking, upkeeping, and managing gas detectors on mobile vehicles under varying road and weather circumstances present an expensive solution for predicting GHG emissions. This article presents the development and evaluation of a reliable and accurate real-time technique for capturing GHG emissions using the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The findings indicate that the integration of gradient-boosting models (LightGBM, xGBoost, and gradient-boosting decision trees) via ensemble learning enhances the precision of CO2 emission predictions.

Evaluation of urban transportation carbon footprint − Artificial intelligence based solution,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104406,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This research uses three machine learning algorithms to predict transport-related CO₂ emissions, considering transport-related factors and socioeconomic aspects. We analyze the top 30 countries that produce the highest transport-related global CO₂ emissions, split evenly between Tier 1 and 2. Tier 1 comprises the five leading nations that produce 61% of the world’s CO₂ emissions, while Tier 2 comprises the subsequent twenty-five nations that produce 35% of the global CO₂ emissions. We assess the efficacy of our model by using four statistical measures (R2, MAE, rRMSE, and MAPE) in a four-fold cross-validation procedure. The Gradient-Boosted Regression (GBR) machine learning model, which incorporates a combination of economic and transportation factors, outperforms the other two machine learning approaches (Support Vector Machine and Ordinary Less Square).

Decisions of shipping supply chain with Arctic route option and emission allowance,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104420,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"With global warming, the Arctic shipping route has become an important alternative when traditional routes face disruption risk. This study sets up a multistage game-theoretical model to investigate the decision problem of shipping supply chain with the traditional route’s disruption risk, Arctic route option, and emission allowance. The paper finds that depending on some important factors (such as market potential, route distance, emission allowance, shipping disruption risk, etc.), the shipping strategy based on traditional route (STR) and that based on Arctic route (SAR) may either be mutually exclusive (i.e., only STR or SAR is selected) or coexist. Furthermore, the disruption risk may lead to two effects, the competition effect (i.e., decreasing the procurement quantity via the traditional route) and the dependence effect (i.e., increasing the procurement quantity via the traditional route). The emission allowance may either weaken or strengthen the dependence effect, but always strengthens the competition effect. A case study is conducted to verify the model and results. This study theoretically enriches the literature on shipping management and Arctic route management, and provide decision-making solutions for shipping supply chains.",1361-9209,Not found
Spatial cross-side network effect of charging stations on electric vehicle adoption,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104400,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"The success of electric vehicle (EV) adoption greatly depends on spatial deployment of charging infrastructure. However, existing literature often overlooks the spatial cross-side network effect (SCNE) of infrastructure on EV adoption. Using the quarterly panel data of Tesla in the United States (US), this study reveals that EV adoption in one state would increase by 5.75% and 1.09% if the charging accessibility increases by 1% in this state and its neighboring states respectively. Furthermore, such effect is heterogeneous between Tesla’s superchargers (SC) and destination charging (DC) stations, in that only accessibility to SC stations can significantly drive vehicle adoption across neighboring states. Moreover, the SCNE of DC stations on vehicle adoption can be amplified if the neighboring states are positioned more centrally in the US interstate highway network. We offer managerial and policy implications for businesses and governments to promote the adoption of EVs by developing the spatially deployed infrastructure.",1361-9209,Not found
"What influences intermodal Choices: Metro-Centric, Bus-Centric, Hybrid? insights from Machine learning Approaches",10.1016/j.trd.2024.104407,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Three types of intermodals are defined: bus-centric, metro-centric, and hybrid, each representing combinations of bus, metro, and a mix of metro and bus with other travel modes for a trip, respectively. Using the household survey from Nanjing, China, comprising 162,191 trips, we applied the multiple models to reveal the nonlinear effects of socio-demographic and travel-related attributes on intermodal travel choices. Results show that bus-centric intermodal choice accounts for 65.82% of the total among the three types. The optimal model, random forest, indicates the relative importance of travel-related, individual, and household attributes, contributing 46.28%, 31.14%, and 22.59% respectively. Non-public transit travel time demonstrates an inverted V-shaped association with bus-centric intermodal choice, with a peak at around 5 min. Older individuals prefer bus-centric intermodal, while younger lean towards metro-centric and hybrid intermodal. Compared to car ownership and motorcycle ownership, bike ownership and E-bike ownership exhibit relatively high impact on intermodal travel choices.",1361-9209,Not found

This study utilized the generalized Pareto distribution to model commuters’ exposure to extreme particulate matter (PM) levels across 36 traffic intersections in Varanasi, India. A Bayesian hierarchical framework was deployed to account for the seasonal variation. The monthly return levels for extreme PM2.5 (PM10) were 589 (1127), 474 (961), and 429 (902) µg/m3 during winter, spring, and summer, respectively. The extreme PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations exceeded the NAAQS severe category for all three seasons. There is a 0.72 % (1.47 %) chance that during winter, PM2.5 (PM10) levels would exceed that of the Delhi smog event (PM2.5: 585 µg/m3, PM10: 989 µg/m3). These findings raise concerns about public health and the environment, particularly in winter.

Are shared automated vehicles good for public- or private-transport-oriented cities (or neither)?,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104373,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Simulation studies suggest that Shared Automated Vehicles (SAVs) could reduce the total vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) thanks to efficiently pooling multiple users in one vehicle. However, mode choice studies indicate that SAVs would attract mostly public transport users, leading to an increase in VKT. This paper is among the first to combine these operational and behavioural expectations and the first to do so analytically. In our theoretical set-up, travellers choose between car, public transport, and SAVs, depending on their individual valuation of private travel and other attributes of each mode. We find that the introduction of SAVs lead to a VKT change in public-transport-oriented cities ranging from a small decrease to a large increase, where the latter is true for plausible parameter settings and hence is a cautionary point for SAV-introduction policies. Conversely, SAVs would attract only few travellers in private-transport-oriented cities and therefore would not significantly impact VKT.",1361-9209,Not found
Factors affecting crossing structure use by khulan and goitered gazelle in China,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104417,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Quantifying the utilization of wildlife crossing structures (CSs) requires considering the local population background. This study assessed the effectiveness of 22 CSs based on the abundance of two ungulates (khulan and goitered gazelle) in northwestern China and analyzed variables influencing their usage such as openness, water source, and human activities in drylands. Results showed that there were 7 and 13 CSs with higher performance indices (PRi) for khulan and goitered gazelle, respectively. Khulan favors CSs near water sources and with large openness, while goitered gazelle prefers structures that include ponding and also feature large openness. Factors like distance to the CSs of the railway, predators, and human activities affect the utilization of CSs by goitered gazelle. This study emphasized the importance of designing and managing effective wildlife CSs by focusing on openness and water resources.

Determinants of the price premium for eco vessels,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104414,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Shipping companies face the trilemma of investing in cheaper but more polluting conventional vessels, in more expensive but eco-friendly ones or postponing their investment. We quantify the price premium paid for eco-friendly vessels and investigate its determinants. The results indicate that eco vessels trade at an average premium of 25% compared to their conventional counterparts, while the corresponding income premia are between 9% and 15%. Our findings further suggest that the price premium depends on the market conditions, with income premia, past price premia, and fleet supply being strong drivers, while fuel costs and market liquidity have a less important effect. The magnitude and significance of these drivers vary based on the market state and segment. Overall, the paper documents the adverse effect that the current technological and regulatory uncertainty has on vessel investment and highlights the need for further policy intervention to reduce market uncertainty and encourage green investment.",1361-9209,Not found

However, numerous socio-technical barriers are likely to impede this innovation process. This study aims to assess the risks of various barriers through a novel fuzzy multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM)-based failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) model. To accomplish this, a panel of experts was convened to identify potential barriers, prioritizing risk criteria by interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) and analytic hierarchy process, and utilizing the IVIF-improved grey relational projection for evaluating and ranking barriers. The model underscores the importance of considering the unique characteristics of EV business model innovation, and a hierarchical system of risk criteria for evaluating barriers is formulated based on the traditional risk factors of FMEA.

Energy savings and emissions reduction of BEVs at an isolated complex intersection,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104403,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"Improving urban dwellers quality of life requires mitigating traffic congestion, minimizing waiting delays, and reducing fuel wastage and associated toxic air pollutants. Battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) are envisioned as the best option, thanks to zero exhaust emissions and regenerative braking. BEVs can be human-driven or autonomous and will co-exist with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) for years. BEVs can help at complex intersections where traffic is saturated. However, their benefits can be reduced by poor intersection management (IM) strategies that coordinate mixed traffic configurations inefficiently. This paper studies energy savings and emissions reduction using BEVs mixed with human-driven ICEVs under eight relevant IM approaches. It shows that adding BEVs has impacts on throughput, energy consumption, waiting delays, and tail-pipe emissions that depend on the specific IM approach used. Thus, this study provides the information needed to support an optimal choice of IM approaches considering the emerging trend towards electrical mobility.",1361-9209,Not found

We estimate gasoline and diesel demand elasticities for Italian households using a dynamic model on a custom-built pseudo-panel. Our results confirm that household demand for transport fuels is more sensitive to the tax component than to the oil price, controlling for income level, age and cohort effects. These results have important implications for the potential effectiveness of transport fuel taxation in setting the decarbonisation pathway: a lower tax rate is required to achieve the target than that assumed on the basis of gross price elasticities.",1361-9209,Not found

We investigated the effects of species characteristics, seasons, and environmental factors on amphibian roadkill patterns. We recorded 503 amphibian carcasses and identified 13 amphibian species. Abundant species are more likely to be killed. There were no significant differences in the roadkill observations between the dry and wet seasons. The number of roadkill observations correlated positively with the percentage of area with buildings.

Institutional entrepreneurship and carbon reduction practices − Evidence from South Korea aviation industry,10.1016/j.trd.2024.104394,136,2024-11-01,2024,11,"This paper identifies regulatory requirements as primary drivers for participation in domestic ETSs, supported by common values and reputation considerations. This extends the theory of institutional entrepreneurship by demonstrating how regulatory frameworks can incentivize corporate actors to adopt sustainable practices. It highlights the critical role of regulatory environments in shaping institutional entrepreneurship, suggesting that stringent regulations can effectively drive organizations toward sustainability. This perceived normative and cognitive pressure aligns with Levy and Kolk (2002), which suggests that climate strategies are formulated by managers from countries where such environmental practices are strictly required (Pinkse, 2007). Compared with previous studies, this paper reveals that collective institutional entrepreneurship can create opportunities for integrating sustainability policies under favorable conditions. Unlike Jolly et al.
