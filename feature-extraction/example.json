        "text": "With remarkable advances in low-cost sensing technologies, an increasing amount of real-world traffic measurement data are collected with high spatial sensor coverage and fine temporal resolution. These large-scale and high-dimensional traffic data provide us with unprecedented opportunities for sensing traffic dynamics and developing efficient and reliable applications for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, there are two critical issues that undermine the use of these data in real-world applications: (1) the presence of missing and corrupted data remains a primary challenge and makes it difficult to get the true signals, and (2) it is computationally challenging to perform large-scale and high-dimensional traffic data analysis using existing methods/algorithms. The issue of missing and corrupted data may arise from complicated sensor malfunctioning, communication failure, and even unsatisfied sensor coverage. To improve data quality and support downstream applications, missing data imputation becomes an essential task. Despite recent efforts and advances in developing machine learning-based imputation models, most studies still focus on small-scale data sets (e.g., 100\n                        \n                           ~\n                        \n                     400 time series) and it remains a critical challenge to perform accurate and efficient imputation on large-scale traffic data sets. In the literature, there are numerous methods for modeling corrupted spatiotemporal traffic data. We summarize these methods from the aspect of time series modeling in two main categories. The first category focuses on single time series modeling, which includes regression methods such as linear regression and autoregressive model (Schafer, 1997; Chen and Shao, 2000). Although this approach is simple, it cannot characterize the correlations/dependencies among different sensors in a spatiotemporal setting. To address this problem, the second category focuses on multivariate/multidimensional setting by modeling multivariate time series data using matrix/tensor structures. In this category, important frameworks include: 1) classical time series analysis methods like vector autoregressive model (Bashir and Wei, 2018), 2) purely low-rank matrix factorization/completion, e.g., low-rank matrix factorization (Asif et al., 2013; Asif et al., 2016), principle component analysis (Qu et al., 2008; Qu et al., 2009) and their variants, 3) purely low-rank tensor factorization/completion, e.g., Bayesian tensor factorization (Chen et al., 2019b) and low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) (Ran et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2020), and 4) low-rank matrix factorization by integrating time series models, e.g., temporal regularized matrix factorization (Yu et al., 2016) and Bayesian temporal matrix factorization (Chen and Sun, 2021). For this large family of methods, a common goal is to capture both temporal dynamics and spatial consistency. For example, it is possible to report superior performance by imposing both local consistency and global consistency in traffic series data (Li et al., 2015). In addition, there are also some nonlinear methods (e.g., deep learning in Che et al. (2018)) that have been applied to address the problem of missing traffic data. Nevertheless, how to generalize these methods to large-scale problems is a long-standing technical gap between research and real-world applications. Thanks to recent advances in low-rank models, it becomes technically feasible to solve large-scale matrix/tensor learning problems through a series of \u201csmaller\u201d subproblems by integrating linear transforms (e.g., discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform) (Rao and Yip, 1990). For instance, to learn from partially observed tensor in large-scale image/video data, recent studies have integrated invertible linear transform into LRTC. Linear transforms like Fourier transform and wavelet transform serve as a key role in developing accurate and fast multidimensional tensor completion models (Kernfeld et al., 2015). Lu et al. (2016), Lu et al. (2019), Lu et al. (2020) introduced some invertible linear transforms (e.g., discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform) into LRTC by connecting tensor tubal rank with tensor singular value decomposition (SVD). As demonstrated in these work, LRTC with invertible linear transforms outperforms by a large margin over LRTC with weighted tensor nuclear norm proposed by Liu et al. (2013). The discrete Fourier transform is the most commonly-used invertible linear transform in the relevant work. To enhance LRTC algorithms with well-suited linear transform, Song et al. (2020) introduced a data-driven unitary transform (computed from singular vectors of data) in LRTC framework. In this work, numerical experiments demonstrate that unitary transform performs better than both discrete Fourier transform and discrete wavelet transform for tensor completion tasks. In modeling spatiotemporal traffic data, the most fundamental assumption is that the data has an inherent low-rank structure either in the matrix or in the tensor form. Therefore, the idea of combining tensor completion and linear transform is also well-suited for spatiotemporal traffic data because day-to-day (or week-to-week) correlation of the multivariate traffic time series can be effectively encoded by linear transforms. Inspired by the idea of linear transforms, we can first convert large-scale tensor completion into a series of \u201csmaller\u201d daily (or weekly) traffic data imputation problems and then connect their solutions by linear transforms, thus overcoming the scalability challenge. Following this idea, in this work, we introduce a scalable low-rank tensor learning model to impute missing traffic data. Our contribution is threefold:\n                        \n                           \u2022\n                           We develop a Low-Tubal-Rank Smoothing Tensor Completion (LSTC-Tubal) model by integrating linear unitary transforms, which is both accurate and efficient for large-scale and high-dimensional traffic data imputation.\n                        \n                        \n                           \u2022\n                           We provide new insight on spatiotemporal data modeling where the large-scale data tensor problem can be solved equivalently through a series of \u201csmall\u201d subproblems by introducing linear transform.\n                        \n                        \n                           \u2022\n                           We conduct extensive imputation experiments on some real-world large-scale traffic data sets. The results show that the proposed LSTC-Tubal model is much more efficient than state-of-the-art models while maintaining comparable accuracy.\n                        \n                     \n                   The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce notations and problem definition in Section 2. Section 3 introduces in detail the proposed low-rank tensor learning model. In Section 4, we conduct numerical experiments on some large-scale traffic data sets and show the performance of LSTC-Tubal compared with several state-of-the-art imputation models. Finally, we summarize the study and discuss future research directions in Section 5.",

As shown in Fig. 2\n                        , the modeling target of missing data imputation can be described as learning the unobserved values from partially observed \n                           \n                              \n                                 \n                                    P\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    \u03a9\n                                 \n                              \n                              (\n                              Y\n                              )\n                           \n                        . In particular, to take advantage of the algebraic structure of tensor, we introduce a forward tensorization operator \n                           \n                              Q\n                              (\n                              \u00b7\n                              )\n                           \n                         that converts the spatiotemporal time series matrix into a third-order tensor (see Fig. 2). This operation is implemented by splitting the time dimension into (time point per day, day)-indexed combinations. For example, we can generate a third-order tensor by the forward tensorization operator as \n                           \n                              X\n                              =\n                              Q\n                              (\n                              Y\n                              )\n                              \u2208\n                              \n                                 \n                                    R\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    M\n                                    \u00d7\n                                    I\n                                    \u00d7\n                                    J\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                        . Conversely, we can also convert the resulted tensor into the original matrix by \n                           \n                              Y\n                              =\n                              \n                                 \n                                    Q\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    -\n                                    1\n                                 \n                              \n                              (\n                              X\n                              )\n                              \u2208\n                              \n                                 \n                                    R\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    M\n                                    \u00d7\n                                    (\n                                    IJ\n                                    )\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                         in which \n                           \n                              \n                                 \n                                    Q\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    -\n                                    1\n                                 \n                              \n                              (\n                              \u00b7\n                              )\n                           \n                         denotes the inverse operator of \n                           \n                              Q\n                              (\n                              \u00b7\n                              )\n                           \n                        .",

                "text": "In fact, spatiotemporal traffic data are multivariate/multidimensional time series associated with both spatial and temporal dimensions. To characterize these data with a suitable algebraic structure, one can represent these data in the form of multivariate time series matrix or multidimensional tensor. Thus, the motivation behind modeling spatiotemporal traffic data in this work is to impose a low-rank structure on the data tensor and build a temporal smoothing process on the data matrix simultaneously. To do so, the essential idea of LSTC-Tubal takes into account both tensor nuclear norm minimization and quadratic variation minimization in a unified tensor completion framework:\n

The positive weight parameter \n                           \n                              \u03bb\n                           \n                         is a trade-off between the tensor nuclear norm and the quadratic variation. We can see intuitively from Fig. 2 that the framework are able to reconstruct \n                           \n                              Y\n                           \n                         with low-rank patterns and time series smoothness because the established constraint \n                           \n                              X\n                              =\n                              Q\n                              (\n                              Z\n                              )\n                           \n                         is closely related to the partially observed matrix \n                           \n                              Y\n                           \n                        . In the objective, we also strengthen the tensor completion model by providing a rigorous connection between tensor tubal rank and tensor nuclear norm (denote by \n                           \n                              \u2016\n                              \u00b7\n                              \n                                 \n                                    \u2016\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    \u2217\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                        ) through invertible linear transform. Notably, under invertible linear transform, tensor nuclear norm minimization has been verified as the convex surrogate to the tensor tubal rank minimization (Kernfeld et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016). To solve the optimization in Eq. (4), we follow the general idea of tensor completion (Liu et al., 2013) and use the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm: Starting with some given initial point \n                           \n                              (\n                              \n                                 \n                                    X\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    0\n                                 \n                              \n                              ,\n                              \n                                 \n                                    Z\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    0\n                                 \n                              \n                              )\n                           \n                        , we generate a sequence \n                           \n                              \n                                 \n                                    {\n                                    (\n                                    \n                                       \n                                          X\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          \u2113\n                                       \n                                    \n                                    ,\n                                    \n                                       \n                                          Z\n                                       \n                                       \n                                          \u2113\n                                       \n                                    \n                                    )\n                                    }\n                                 \n                                 \n                                    \u2113\n                                    \u2208\n                                    N\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                         via the scheme.

It is not difficult to see that if we impose a unitary transform along a certain dimension of the tensor, then the tensor nuclear norm minimization can be performed by solving nuclear norm minimization problems of \u201csmall\u201d matrices, making it computationally efficient and scalable to large data. In the literature, invertible linear transforms applied to the tensor completion problem have also been proved to satisfy certain tensor operation property (Kernfeld et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016). In Fig. 3\n                        , we provide an intuitive schematic for illustrating Lemma 1. We can see that the tensor singular value thresholding is well-suited for spatiotemporal traffic data that characterized by the dimensions of \u201csensor\u201d, \u201ctime point of day\u201d, and \u201cday\u201d. The corresponding subproblems in the form of matrix allow one to implement singular value thresholding on the unitary transformed matrix for each day while the day-to-day correlation can be preserved by the unitary transform matrix. Therefore, regarding the problem in Eq.

In what follows, we create two missing patterns, i.e., random missing (RM) and non-random missing (NM), which are same as in our prior work (Chen et al., 2020). According to the mechanism of RM and NM patterns, we mask a certain amount of observations as missing values (i.e., 30%, 70%) in these data sets, and the remaining partial observations are input data. To assess the imputation performance, we use the actual values of the masked missing entries as the ground truth to compute MAPE and RMSE:\n                           \n

This model is built on HaLRTC where the weighted tensor nuclear norm is replaced by multiple truncated nuclear norms with a truncation rate parameter. It has been shown to be superior to TRMF (Yu et al., 2016), BTMF (Chen and Sun, 2021), and the two other baseline models also mentioned in this article, i.e., BGCP (Chen et al., 2019b) and HaLRTC (Liu et al., 2013).\n                           \n                           \n                              \u2022\n                              LSTC-DCT: We also compare the LSTC model with discrete cosine transform (DCT).

(2019). Note that DCT is a special case of linear unitary transform. When comparing LSTC-DCT to the proposed LSTC-Tubal model, it is possible to see the importance of unitary transform in LSTC-Tubal.\n                           \n                        To make the

For the BPMF, BGCP, and BATF models, we set the low rank to 10 on both PeMS data sets due to the possibly high computational cost underlying the greater low rank. For all Gibbs sampling based Bayesian models, we set the number of burn-in iterations and Gibbs iterations as 1000 and 200, respectively.

Through cross validation, we evaluate both LSTC-DCT and LSTC-Tubal models with the following parameters: 1) For PeMS-4W and PeMS-8W data, we set \n                           \n                              \u03bb\n                              =\n                              0.001\n                              \u00d7\n                              \u03c1\n                           \n                         where \n                           \n                              \u03c1\n                              =\n                              0.001\n                           \n                         (RM) and \n                           \n                              \u03c1\n                              =\n                              0.0001\n                           \n                         (NM); 2) For London-1M data, we set \n                           \n                              \u03bb\n                              =\n                              0.001\n                              \u00d7\n                              \u03c1\n                           \n                         and \n                           \n                              \u03c1\n                              =\n                              0.001\n                           \n                        ; 3) For Guangzhou-2\u00a0M data, we set we set \n                           \n                              \u03bb\n                              =\n                              0.5\n                              \u00d7\n                              \u03c1\n                           \n                         and \n                           \n                              \u03c1\n                              =\n                              0.002\n                           \n                        .

For RM scenarios on both PeMS-4W and PeMS-8W data sets, the proposed LSTC-Tubal model achieves high accuracy which is close to the best performance achieved by LRTC-TNN. For NM scenarios, LSTC-Tubal is inferior to the LRTC-TNN model due to whole days missing in each time series. By comparing with HaLRTC, we can see that LSTC-Tubal (\n                              \n                                 \u03bb\n                                 =\n                                 0\n                              \n                           ) performs consistently better in all missing scenarios. This clearly shows that tensor nuclear norm minimization with unitary transform is superior to weighted tensor nuclear norm minimization. The comparison results between LSTC-DCT and LSTC-Tubal indicate that data-driven unitary transform is more capable of characterizing day-to-day correlation than discrete cosine transform. Of results in Table 1, LRTC-TNN produces comparable imputation accuracy. However, observing the running time of these imputation models in Table 2\n                           , it is not difficult to conclude that LRTC-TNN is not well-suited to these large-scale imputation tasks due to the extremely high computational cost. Table 2 clearly shows that LSTC-Tubal with unitary transformed tensor nuclear norm minimization scheme is the most computationally efficient model. Therefore, from both Table 1 and 2, the results suggest that the proposed LSTC-Tubal model is an efficient solution to large-scale traffic data imputation while still maintaining an imputation performance close to the state-of-the-art models. We further discuss the imputation of the LSTC-Tubal (\n                              \n                                 \u03bb\n                                 \n                                 \u2260\n                                 \n                                 0\n                              \n                           ) by providing the heatmap of unitary transform matrices in Fig. 4\n                            and the visualization of time series in Fig. 5\n                           . As shown in Fig. 4(a), the initial unitary transform matrix produced by the partially observed tensor only harnesses the most basic daily patterns where the first few columns can help identify weekday and weekend. In the following iterative process, the patterns underlying unitary transform matrix become more complicated and informative (see Fig. 4(b-c)). Fig. 5 shows that LSTC-Tubal can produce masked time series points accurately by learning from partial observations."

Of these results, LSTC-Tubal performs better than HaLRTC and LSTC-DCT. It implies that the LSTC framework with unitary transform is superior to both tensor nuclear norm minimization in HaLRTC and LSTC with discrete cosine transform. On London-1M data, LSTC-Tubal achieves competitive results as the best one reported by LRTC-TNN. On Guangzhou-2M data, LSTC-Tubal is approaching the best performance achieved by LRTC-TNN. In the NM scenario, the results of LSTC-Tubal are also comparable to the baseline models. Notably, quadratic variation smoothing can help improve the imputation performance of LSTC-Tubal.

Scalability is an important capability of models to handle data available over different scales. Yet, one can wonder whether it is necessary to perform imputation on large-scale data. To answer this question, we conduct some experiments on PeMS-4W data. Recall that PeMS-4W data has 11160 road segments. To perform imputation on different scales of data, we use the multilevel k-way graph partitioning algorithm on the adjacency matrix of PeMS-4W data as in Mallick et al.

And in the 70% NM scenario, the best performance is achieved when the number of partitions is 1/2.\n                              \n                              \n                                 \u2022\n                                 LSTC-Tubal: In the RM scenario, LSTC-Tubal performs best when there is no partitioning.

BGCP\u2014a fully Bayesian tensor decomposition model with a fixed low rank\u2014can preserve a more informative factorization structure for the RM scenario on small-scale data than on large-scale data due to the possibly strong similarity within each partition. However, in the NM scenario, learning a well-behaved BGCP model requires more informative data and therefore, BGCP performs better when there are fewer partitions. \n                           Fig. 7\n                            shows that LSTC-Tubal model reports greater singular values for RM data than NM data. Compare to the NM scenario, there are more relatively large singular values obtained from LSTC-Tubal in the RM scenario. Table 4 also demonstrates that LSTC-Tubal can learn informative singular values from large-scale data than from a series of subsets in the RM scenario. In the NM scenario, it seems that LSTC-Tubal can learn a series of effective low-rank structures from subsets than from large-scale data. In light of the above, there are two important factors that motivate the necessity of working on large-scale data: the pattern of missing data and the modeling mechanism. Therefore, modeling on large-scale data in this work is of great significance."

        "text": "In this work, we develop a Low-Tubal-Rank Smoothing Tensor Completion (LSTC-Tubal) model for large-scale spatiotemporal imputation with superior efficiency. In this model, we use tensor nuclear norm minimization scheme to model the inherent low-rank property of traffic data (third-order tensors of sensor \n                        \n                           \u00d7\n                        \n                      time of day \n                        \n                           \u00d7\n                        \n                      day). This third-order tensor structure allows us to efficiently implement the nuclear norm minimization on the unitary transformed matrix for each day, while the day-to-day correlations can be preserved by the unitary transform matrix. Our experiments show that the proposed LSTC-Tubal model is very computationally efficient while still maintaining the imputation accuracy close to the state-of-the-art models. Experiments also show that the data-driven unitary transform matrix can harness effective traffic patterns. This paper also provides valuable insight into spatiotemporal data modeling, and there are also some future directions to advance this research:\n                        \n                           \u2022\n                           As shown in Lemma 1, the tensor singular value thresholding scheme is achieved by the singular value thresholding of matrix nuclear norm minimization. In the future, it would be feasible to adopt the truncated nuclear norm minimization for this scheme and improve the model performance.\n                        \n                        \n                           \u2022\n                           In this work, we only use the quadratic variation to smooth time series. It is possible to replace the quadratic variation by time series models for capturing temporal dynamics. In this way, the built model can be applied to not only missing traffic data imputation, but also traffic forecasting in the presence of missing values.\n                        \n                     \n                  ",
