       "'This study used data from the longitudinal, online survey conducted as part of the European research project Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA) (Dons et al., 2015; Gerike et al., 2016). PASTA aimed to strengthen the understanding of determinants of active mobility (Götschi et al., 2017) as well as its health impacts (Mueller et al., 2018) by integrating approaches from transport and health research. The survey took place from November 2014 to January 2017 in seven European cities: Antwerp (Belgium), Barcelona (Spain), London (United Kingdom), Örebro (Sweden), Rome (Italy), Vienna (Austria) and Zurich (Switzerland). Survey participants were recruited opportunistically on a rolling basis, applying a diverse set of approaches but following a common sampling strategy across cities (Gaupp-Berghausen and Raser, 2017). Active transport modes were intentionally oversampled to have sufficiently large sample sizes for different transport modes in each of the cities. Participants from the age of 18\\u202fyears (16\\u202fyears in Zurich) were allowed to participate (Dons et al., 2015; Raser et al., 2018). Survey participants filled out an extensive baseline questionnaire followed by follow-up questionnaires approximately every two weeks. The baseline questionnaire included questions on socio-economic and psychological background of participants, their travel behaviour including bicycle types used and a one-day travel diary, their physical activity level, as well as geo-location of their home and work or place of education. Short follow-up questionnaires included brief questions on travel behaviour, physical activity and traffic crashes, while every third follow-up questionnaire included longer assessments of physical activity and a one day travel diary (Dons et al., 2015; Gerike et al., 2016; Raser et al., 2018). Survey participants were incentivized to complete the questionnaires through lotteries. The chances of winning a prize increased with the number of completed questionnaires. These lotteries were applied in six out of the seven cities. In Örebro it was not allowed by the Swedish law. More details on the recruitment strategy has been published elsewhere (Gaupp-Berghausen et al., 2019). The presented analysis takes two perspectives: First, participant characteristics, travel behaviour and resulting physical activity are compared between three groups: e-bikers, cyclists and non-cyclists. Secondly, within e-bikers, comparisons are made across subgroups based on main travel mode substituted by e-bike, such as car, public transport, bicycle or multiple modes. The distinction of e-bikers vs. cyclists was based on the following question at the baseline: “What type of bicycle do you use?”. Respondents stating that they used an e-bike were categorized as e-bikers, independent of whether they also used a conventional bicycle. Using this classification around the half of e-bikers only use e-bike while the other half use additionally a different type of bicycle. Users who reported any use of non-electric bicycle (including city bike, mountain bike or bike-sharing) but not e-bike were categorized as cyclists, those who did not report any bicycle use, as non-cyclists. Bike-sharing schemes in the studied cities were non-electric during the survey period. Therefore, it was assumed that the e-bikes of e-bikers were personally owned and not part of a bike-sharing system. The assignment of the substituted mode group was based on the following question at the baseline questionnaire: “Thinking about the journeys that you use your electric bike for now, what method of travel did you use before using an electric bike?”. This question was asked only once in the survey and persistence of the decision to switch to e-bike was not assessed. The total sample of survey participants was characterized among groups regarding background aspects such as city, age, sex, income, education level, car access and body mass index (BMI, weight in kilograms divided by square of height in meters). To facilitate comparison across groups, income categories were converted to a continuous scale by replacing the seven original income ranges with the midpoint of each range. In addition, to avoid comparability issues across cities income data was adjusted dividing by a national price level index for household final consumption expenditure (HFCE) (EUROSTAT, 2016). Furthermore, some e-bike specific background aspects such as transport mode substitution, motivation for e-biking, safety perception and helmet use were analysed. Both general and e-bike specific background aspects of the sample of participants were based on data from the baseline questionnaire. Travel behaviour was assessed using the following indicators: a) travel frequency in terms of days per month and trips per day, b) travel duration and c) travel distance, all stratified by transport mode. Travel frequency in terms of day per month was captured in the baseline questionnaire using a mode frequency table, including separate entries for cycling and e-biking. Categorical travel frequency data was converted into an average number of days per month. Participants further reported trip durations in a one-day travel diary at baseline and as part of every third follow-up. Travel frequency in terms of trips per day was derived using the travel diary. Trip duration was estimated using start and end time of each reported trip and assigning this total trip duration to the main transport mode involved (i.e. transit trip duration includes some walking). Additionally, weekly durations riding e-bike or conventional bicycle were captured using an adapted version of the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) (Cleland et al., 2014; WHO, 2014) at baseline and during follow-ups and converted to daily travel durations. In contrast to the original version of the GPAQ, walking, cycling and e-biking durations were captured separately. Trip distances were derived based on origin and destination locations reported through a map widget in the travel diary, which were afterwards used to obtain fastest routes using the Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API) (Google). Trip distance was derived by selecting the fastest route returned by the Google Maps API (Raser et al., 2018). Geo-locations of origins and destinations were only available at the trip level. Distances for multimodal trips were assigned to the main mode using the following hierarchy: public transport, car, e-bike, bicycle, walking (Raser et al., 2018). Further, average trip distance and duration as well as average daily travel distance and duration were estimated using data from the travel diaries. Average trip distance and duration were calculated as the mean of all trips from baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Average daily travel distance and duration were calculated as the mean of daily trips across follow-ups within participant, and then averaged across all participants. Physical activity was assessed using the following indicators: a) MET minutes per week based on GPAQ and b) the single-item physical activity measure (\\n                     Hartmann, 2017\\n                     ; \\n                     Milton et al., 2011\\n                     ). The GPAQ was used at baseline and during every third follow-up to capture duration and intensity of physical activities in the domains labour, transport (see above) and leisure. Standard values of intensity for each activity, measured in Metabolic Equivalents of Task (METs) were applied to calculate physical activity (measured in MET minutes per week) (WHO, 2014; Laeremans et al., 2017). Overall physical activity, as well as transport related physical activity were calculated assuming 4 METs for moderate and 8 METs for vigorous intensity physical activity, 6.8 METs for cycling, 4 METs for walking, and 5 METs for e-biking (Peterman et al., 2016; Sperlich et al., 2012). To estimate physical activity before using e-bike, the following intensities for substituted non-active transport modes were assumed: 2.5 METs for car (car-driving) and 1.3 METs for public transport use (excluding access trips, egress trips and transfer) (Ainsworth et al). For “other or multiple mode” substitution no physical activity before using e-bike was estimated since the proportion of each substituted mode was unknown. The single-item physical activity measure asked participants a single question: “In a typical week, on how many days do you do a total of 30 min or more of physical activity, which is enough to raise your breathing rate? This may include sport, exercise, and brisk walking or cycling for recreation or to get to and from places, but should not include housework or physical activity that may be part of your job” (Milton et al., 2011) (only baseline questionnaire was considered). In total 10,722 persons participated in the survey and 87,094 questionnaires (including baseline and follow-ups) were collected. The number of participants in follow-up questionnaires decreased over time from around 6800 in the first one, to <1000 from the 25th one. Travel diaries were provided by 7809 participants recording 76,986 trips. As a result of data cleaning the final data set included 9335 persons, 76,283 questionnaires and 40,553 trips. Additionally GPAQ data were recoded according to WHO guidelines (WHO, 2014) and following the work of Laeremans et al. (Laeremans et al., 2017). Further details of the data cleaning and recoding can be found in the Supplementary materials. Statistical analysis was conducted in open-source software R (R Core Team, 2017). Normal distribution for studied variables was assumed based on inspection of data. Comparisons of means were based on ANOVA for continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical and binomial variables, and corresponding confidence intervals and p-values were calculated. Confidence intervals were calculated applying the classic method for continuous variables, Wilson method for binomial variables and Sison & Glaz method for categorical variables and using the DescTool R package (Signorell et al., 2018).\\n                     \\n                        \\n                           \\n                              Supplementary material\\n                           \\n                           Image 1\\n                           \\n                        \\n                     \\n                  '"
