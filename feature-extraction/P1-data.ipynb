      "Broader studies can be carried out if more information about trip planner data is available, and if the privacy concerns about the trip planner application can be reduced. It is unknown whether it is a single journey with multiple legs or a group of people traveling with one trip planner request. Therefore, if the user ID is available, we can reduce the underestimation of trip planner’s importance. Moreover, knowing the alternatives provided for a piece of trip advice can be meaningful so that we can study the user preference and behavior. Besides, distinguishing between the user type will be advantageous to understand the travel preference among different kinds of travelers. Also, with this additional information, we can gain insights into how often different types of people make requests. Lastly, two types of events could significantly influence the ridership in PT, i.e., an accident/breakdown (which cannot be predicted) and predictive events (such as concerts, sports events, markets, school holidays). In our data, we have a one-week school holiday, which lies in the scope of the latter, and 9292 has already been investigating extensively in this regard through correlation analysis. However, how could this type of data contribute to sudden events is not yet well understood.\n",
