description: 'How do archaeologists share their research data, if at all? We review
  what data are, according to current influential definitions, and previous work on
  the benefits, costs and norms of data sharing in the sciences broadly. To understand
  data sharing in archaeology, we present the results of three pilot studies: requests
  for data by email; review of data availability in published articles, and analysis
  of archaeological datasets deposited in repositories. We find that archaeologists
  are often willing to share, but discipline-wide sharing is patchy and ad hoc. Legislation
  and mandates are effective at increasing data-sharing, but editorial policies at
  journals lack adequate enforcement. Although most of data available at repositories
  are licensed to enable flexible reuse, only a small proportion of the data are stored
  in structured formats for easy reuse. We present some suggestions for improving
  the state of date sharing in archaeology, among these is a standard for citing data
  sets to ensure that researchers making their data publicly available receive appropriate
  credit.'
