# HyperETA

These are the program of the paper ***HyperETA: a Non-Deep-Learning Method for Estimated Time of Arrival***. 

Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) that predicts a given GPS trajectoryâ€™s travel time has been widely used in route planning. 
We present a new machine learning algorithm, called HyperETA, for ETA prediction.
HyperETA is based on the Hypercube clustering method to measure the similarity among trajectories.
This program uses Cheng-Du taxi trajectories as a benchmark.


# Usage:

Clicking "Reproducible Run" and the Output will show MAPE and RMSE and MAE of HyperETA and HyperETA_noDTW.


# Data

## train

Raw trajectories for train.
