name: 'Reducing meat and animal product consumption: what works?'
description: 'What interventions for reducing consumption of meat and animal products
  (MAP) have been tested and validated in the scientific literature, and what theories
  of change drive the most effective interventions? This paper offers a comprehensive
  theoretical review and a focused meta-analysis in an attempt to answer these questions.
  First, we summarize the six major strands of this interdisciplinary literature:
  direct appeals to consumers on animal welfare, health, and/or environmental, grounds;
  choice architecture/nudges; changes to economic variables (e.g. price); and indirect
  psychological appeals (e.g. attempts to create or manipulate norms related to vegetarianism).
  Second, we assess and quantitatively meta-analyze the 40 randomized interventions,
  coming from 27 papers, that seek to reduce MAP consumption while also 1) measuring
  MAP consumption directly 2) at least a single treatment was first administered 3)
  with at least 25 subjects in treatment and control (or at least 10 clusters total
  for cluster-assigned studies). Our main finding is that appeals to environmental
  and health concerns most reliably reduce MAP consumption, while studies administered
  online, appeals to animal welfare, and choice architecture/nudging studies generally
  do not produce meaningful effects. We conclude by noting some promising theories
  and avenues that have yet to be rigorously tested and replicated, as well as outlining
  the next steps for this paper.'
