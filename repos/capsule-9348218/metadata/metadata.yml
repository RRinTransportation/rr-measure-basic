  This Code Ocean capsule contains reproducible versions of the manuscript and the electronic supplemental materials of the tutorial paper titled **"Best Practices in Supervised Machine Learning: A Tutorial for Psychologists"**, published in *Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science* and on *PsyArXiv* (<https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/89snd>). Code Ocean provides the most convenient way to interactively follow along with the exercises of the tutorial without having to install any software on your own computer.

  __Instructions:__

  1) Log into your **Code Ocean account** or create a new one under <https://codeocean.com/signup>.

  1) Go back to this capsule. In the top right click on **"Edit Capsule"**. This will create your own editable copy of the capsule.

  3) In the top right under **"or launch a workstation"** (which is only available for the editable copy) press the **"RStudio"** button. An interactive RStudio session will start directly in your browser. All R packages used in our tutorial are already installed.

  4) When RStudio is ready, click on one of the **.Rmd Files in the "code" folder**: *the exercise .Rmd files 1-4 in the exercises folder, manuscript.Rmd, electronic_supplemental_material.Rmd*

  5) Within each .Rmd file, you can run the code by clicking on the **"Play"** buttons displayed in green next to each code chunk. You can also experiment with the code by making changes.

  6) Make sure to close RStudio after working with the tutorial. Keeping it open will use up your monthly budget of free computing hours.
