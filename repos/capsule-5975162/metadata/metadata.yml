name: 'ExPSO Package: Exponential Particle Swarm Optimization for Global Optimization'
description: The ExPSO package is a Python library that includes an algorithm designed
  to optimize machine and deep learning parameters/hyperparameters. This method involves
  dividing the swarm population into three subpopulations and employing a search strategy
  that incorporates an exponential function. By doing so, the particles are able to
  take significant leaps within the search space. Additionally, the algorithm dynamically
  adjusts the control of each particle's velocity range to strike a balance between
  exploration and exploitation during the search process. The leaping strategy is
  integrated into the velocity equation, and a new cognitive parameter that linearly
  decreases over time is introduced, along with a dynamic inertia weight strategy.
