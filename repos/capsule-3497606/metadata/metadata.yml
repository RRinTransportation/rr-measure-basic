name: Super-Iterative Image Reconstruction for Tomography
description: In this capsule an implementation of the Super-Iterative algorithm based
  on simplified PET projection data is shown. The method presents a novel strategy
  to go beyond the expected resolution-noise limits for a given low-resolution (LR)
  sinogram based on a high-resolution (HR) one. From the projections of the LR reconstructed
  image, we redistribute the counts of each line-of-response (LOR) into three subLORs
  to obtain an estimation of the HR sinogram. The whole process of estimation and
  reconstruction of the HR sinogram is called a super-iteration.
