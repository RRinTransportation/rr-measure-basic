name: 'Making a Difference: The Consequences of Electoral Experiments'
description: While experiments on elections represent a popular tool in social science,
  the possibility that experimental interventions could affect who wins office remains
  a central ethical concern. I formally characterize electoral experimental designs
  to derive an upper bound on aggregate electoral impact under different assumptions
  about interference. I then introduce a decision rule based on comparison of this
  bound to predicted election outcomes to determine whether an experiment should be
  implemented. Researchers can mitigate the possibility of affecting aggregate outcomes
  by reducing the saturation of treatment or focusing experiments in districts and
  electoral systems where treated voters are less likely to be pivotal. These conditions
  identify novel trade-offs between adhering to ethical commitments and the statistical
  power and external validity of electoral experiments. More broadly, this paper shows
  that the formalization of an ethical objective facilitates a closer mapping between
  ethical considerations and experimental design than is currently practiced.
