The R script 'analysis' contains code for results, figures and tables that appear in the article.

The data comes in four data tables:

exp1.txt:		contains data from Experiment 1
exp2.txt:		contains data from Experiment 2
payoffs.txt:	contains experimental payoffs for all participants of Experiment 1 and 2
villages.txt:	contains village-level data of Experiment 1 and 2 and further village information 

Every table has an associated text file that starts with 'variables...' and explains all variable names and response codings.
