# CULP: Classification Using Link Prediction
This is the implementation of the CULP classification algorithm from the paper ***Classification Using Link Prediction***.

* run `iris_sample.py` to run CULP on the Iris dataset with 80% of instances as the training data 
* run `zoo_sample` for the Zoo dataset with 80% of the instances being the training data.
* run `wine_sample` for the Wine dataset with 80% of the instances being the training data.

or run `run.sh` to run CULP on all the cases above.
