name: A Delphi study to strengthen research methods training in undergraduate psychology
  programmes
description: Psychology programmes often emphasise inferential statistical tests over
  a solid understanding of data and research design. This imbalance may leave graduates
  under-equipped to effectively interpret research and employ data to answer questions.
  We conducted a consensus process in the form of a two round modified-Delphi study.
  Our goal was to identify the research methods skills that the UK psychology community
  deems essential for undergraduates to learn. Participants included 103 research
  methods instructors, academics, students, and non-academic psychologists. Of 78
  items included in the consensus process, 34 reached consensus. Coupled with a qualitative
  analysis of 707 open-ended text responses, we developed nine recommendations for
  organisations that accredit undergraduate psychology programmes—such as the British
  Psychological Society (BPS). We recommend emphasising (1) data skills, (2) research
  design, (3) descriptive statistics, (4) critical analysis, (5) both significance
  testing and parameter estimation, and (6) qualitative methods; as well as (7) giving
  precedence to foundational skills, (8) promoting transferable skills, and (9) creating
  space within curricula to enable these recommendations. Our data and findings can
  help modernise accreditation standards to include clearly-defined, assessable skills
  that have broad acceptance and foster a competent graduate body for the contemporary
  world.
