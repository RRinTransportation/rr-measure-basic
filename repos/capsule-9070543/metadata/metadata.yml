name: Intermittent Drug Treatment of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> Melanoma Cells Delays Resistance
  by Sensitizing Cells to Rechallenge
description: Melanoma patients receiving drugs targeting BRAFV600E and MKK1/2 invariably
  develop resistance and continue progression, limiting the efficacy of treatment.
  As an alternative to continuous dosing schedules, intermittent treatment strategies
  involving intervening periods of drug withdrawal have been proposed as a means to
  delay resistance. The efficacy of this treatment strategy has been supported by
  preclinical findings and clinical case reports. The beneficial effect of intermittent
  treatment has been attributed to “drug addiction”, in which the cell viability of
  resistant cells is compromised during periods of drug removal due to MAP kinase
  pathway hyperactivation. However, the mechanistic basis of intermittent treatment
  is still incompletely understood. Here, we show that intermittent treatment with
  the BRAFV600E inhibitor, LGX818/encorafenib, suppresses growth compared to continuous
  treatment in human melanoma cells engineered to express BRAFV600E, p61-BRAFV600E
  or MKK2C125S oncogenes. While drug addiction is clearly observable in these cells,
  it fails to account for the advantageous effects of intermittent treatment. Instead,
  growth suppression can be explained mainly by resensitization during periods of
  drug removal, followed by cell death when drug is readded. Transcriptome analysis
  of drug resistant cells identifies a subset of genes with a distinct pattern of
  reversibility occurring with successive cycles of drug removal and readdition. The
  transcriptomes of cells with drug removed were distinct from those treated continuously,
  but rechallenge with drug recovered the transcriptome of continuous treatment. We
  conclude that the beneficial effects of intermittent treatment in our model are
  best explained by adaptive, non-mutational changes in transcription which confer
  drug resensitization.
