name: Replication files for Neurons Learn by Predicting Future Activity
description: This capsule contains the code for "Neurons learn by predicting future activity"  to reproduce the learning curves Figure 2-E (In this capsule, we set up maximum epoch = 3, because we would like to show that the network learns properly even with a small number of epochs ).
