name: 'Measuring the effects of exercise in neuromuscular disorders: a systematic
  review and meta-analyses'
description: The benefit and safety of exercise training for patients with neuromuscular
  disorders has long been a contentious topic. This is, in part, due to recognised
  challenges associated with rare diseases including small and heterogenous patient
  populations. We performed a systematic review and meta-analyses to evaluate the
  effectiveness and safety of interventional exercise and establish minimal clinically
  important differences (MCID) in outcome measures in neuromuscular disorders to facilitate
  clinical interpretation.
