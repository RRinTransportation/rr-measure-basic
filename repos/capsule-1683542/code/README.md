# Measuring the effects of exercise in neuromuscular disorders: a systematic review and meta-analyses

This capsule presents the data and output for meta-analysis of three datasets related to studies of the effects of exercise in neuromuscular disorders.

**Datasets**


1. ‘ADL’: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) meta-analysis data

2. ‘Ex.vs.NonEx’: Exercise vs Usual Care meta-analysis data

3. ‘Pre.Post’: Before and After exercise training meta-analysis data

**Raw data**

The capsule also contains raw data files (spreadsheets), providing all tabulations:

Files 1 to 7 include raw data files for study details.

Files 1, 2, and 3 include tabulation of study populations (overall, exercised trained and usual care, respectively) for patients with NMD included for systematic review. Data is provided per included article and classified according to specific NMD.

1. Overall clinical population tabulation. Underlying data for Table 2, Extended data

2. Exercise training tabulation. Underlying data for Table 3, Extended data

3. Usual care tabulation. Underlying data for Table 3, Extended data

File 4 includes tabulation of study details (gender, age) for all articles included for systematic review. Data is provided per included article for exercise-trained and usual care patients with NMD.

4. Demographics tabulation. Underlying data for Table 5, Extended data

File 5 includes tabulation of study design for all articles included for systematic review. File 5 also included tabulation of reasons articles were excluded from meta-analysis.

5. Study design_systematic review. Underlying data for Table 4, Extended data and part of figure 1

(flow chart of study selection)

File 6 and 7 include tabulation of study design for respective meta-analyses. Outcome measures for meta-analysis are also tabulated via each included article.

6. Study design_outcome measures_meta-analysis 1 (exercise vs. usual care meta-analysis)

7. Study design_outcome measures_meta-analysis 2 (before vs. after exercise training meta-analysis)

File 8 to 12 include raw data files for intervention details.

File 8 includes tabulation of intervention setting and intervention supervision for all articles included for systematic review.

8. Setting and Supervision Underlying data for Figure 1 and 2, respectively, Extended data

File 9, 10, and 11 includes tabulation of interventional details for aerobic training, strength training and combined training, respectively.

9. Aerobic training details Underlying data for Figure 3 to 7, Extended Data

10. Strength training details Underlying data for Figure 3 to 7, Extended Data

11. Combined training details Underlying data for Figure 3 to 7, Extended Data

File 12 includes the linked spreadsheet workbook for the study interventional summary details.

12. Graph data for study intervention details Underlying (summary data) for Figure 1 to 7, Extended Data

**Extended data**

The capsule also contains an Extended data file (word document), providing the following:

· Search Strategy (Table 1)

· Summary details for systematic review; including neuromuscular disorders (NMD) (Table 2), study population groups (Table 3), and study designs (Table 4)

· Study interventional summary details (including setting, supervision, duration, frequency, session time, and compliance) (Figure 1-8)

· Study details summary per article (including population group, demographics and intervention details) (Table 5)

· Study quality (Table 6 and Table 7)

· Ordinal activities of daily living (ADL) proportion data and forest plots (Figure 9-11)

· Forest plots of outcomes with no statistical significance (Figure 12-29)

· Funnel plots (Figure 30-43)

· Subgroup analysis (Table 8-13) and sensitivity analysis (Table 14- 26)

· Sample size calculation (before versus after exercise training) for future interventional trials (Figure 44)

· GRADE summary of findings (Table 27)

· Adverse events (Table 28)

· Excluded full text articles (Table 29)

**Interactive database:**

Additionally, all meta-analysis and systematic review outcome data is available via the following link: https://www.newcastle-mitochondria.com/train-nmd/

The 'Meta Analysis Results' tab presents an interactive graph of the key results from all the meta-analyses. The accompanying table provides the key statistics from each analysis along with links to more detailed data from the individual studies and the forest plot of the study and overall effect sizes.

The 'Systematic Review Database' tab presents information on individual studies within each outcome domain. The user can select subsets of these domains according to a variety of criteria. There is then the option to download more information on these defined subsets as a CSV file.
