name: 'Less Annotating, More Classifying: Addressing the Data Scarcity Issue of Supervised
  Machine Learning with Deep Transfer Learning and BERT-NLI'
description: Supervised machine learning is an increasingly popular tool for analysing
  large political text corpora. The main disadvantage of supervised machine learning
  is the need for thousands of manually annotated training data points. This issue
  is particularly important in the social sciences where most new research questions
  require the automation of a new task with new and imbalanced training data. This
  paper analyses how deep transfer learning can help address this challenge by accumulating
  ‘prior knowledge’ in algorithms. Pre-training algorithms like BERT creates representations
  of statistical language patterns (‘language knowledge’), and training on universal
  tasks like Natural Language Inference (NLI) reduces reliance on task-specific data
  (‘task knowledge’). We systematically show the benefits of transfer learning on
  a wide range of eight tasks. Across these eight tasks, BERT-NLI fine-tuned on 100
  to 2500 data points performs on average 10.7 to 18.3 percentage points better than
  classical algorithms without transfer learning. Our study indicates that BERT-NLI
  trained on 500 data points achieves similar average performance as classical algorithms
  trained on around 5000 data points. Moreover, we show that transfer learning works
  particularly well on imbalanced data. We conclude by discussing limitations of transfer
  learning and by outlining new opportunities for political science research.
