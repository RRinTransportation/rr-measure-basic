name: 'Linked Dynamic Graph CNN: Learning through Point Cloud by Linking Hierarchical
  Features'
description: We propose a linked dynamic graph CNN (LDGCNN) to classify and segment
  point cloud directly. We remove the transformation network, link hierarchical features
  from dynamic graphs, freeze feature extractor, and retrain the classifier to increase
  the performance of LDGCNN.
