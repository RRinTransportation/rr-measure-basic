# Predict the survival outcomes of GC patient using RSF method
This repository includes custom codes to predict the survival outcomes of GC patients. We built a prediction model by using Random Survival Forests (RSF) method.
## Dependencies:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scikit-survival
- eli5

## How to use

Put data in the `data` folder. And by following steps in `RSF_final.ipynb`, you can get results in outputs, and generated figures in the `figures` folder.

Scripts in `Rscript` folder are used to draw plots of model prediction performances,and the related plots are located in `Figures` folder.
