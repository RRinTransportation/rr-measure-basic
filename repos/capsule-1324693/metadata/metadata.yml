  replication of Murray, Rose, Bellavia, Holmes, and Kusche (2002) Study 3'
description: Across three studies, Murray, Rose, Bellavia, Holmes, and Kusche (2002)
  found that low self-esteem individuals responded in a negative manner compared to
  those high in self-esteem in the face of relationship threat, perceiving their partners
  and relationships less positively. This was the first empirical support for the
  hypothesized dynamics of a dependency regulation perspective, and has had a significant
  impact on the field of relationship science. In the present research, we sought
  to reproduce the methods and procedures of Study 3 of Murray et al. (2002) to further
  test the two-way interaction between individual differences in self-esteem and situational
  relationship threat. Manipulation check effects replicated the original study, but
  no interaction between self-esteem and experimental condition was observed for any
  primary study outcomes.
