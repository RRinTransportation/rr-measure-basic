Abstract (link to preprint: https://psyarxiv.com/5suda/)

Across three studies, Murray et al. (2002) found that low self-esteem individuals responded in a negative manner compared to those 
high in self-esteem in the face of relationship threat, perceiving their partners and relationships less positively. This was the 
first empirical support for the hypothesized dynamics of a dependency regulation perspective, and has had a significant impact on
the field of relationship science. In the present research, we sought to reproduce the methods and procedures of Study 3 of 
Murray et al. (2002) to further test the two-way interaction between individual differences in self-esteem and situational 
relationship threat. Manipulation check effects replicated the original study, but no interaction between self-esteem and 
experimental condition was observed for any primary study outcomes.
