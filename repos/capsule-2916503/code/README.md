# An Example of Compute Capsule

_This is an example compute capsule of the book chapter "Developing and Disseminating Data Analysis Tools for Open Science" in L. Plonsky (Ed.), Open Science in Applied Linguistics._

## Code, Data, Results
On the left hand column, you can see folders `/code`, `/data`, and `/results`, where code and data are saved. You can upload your own files to the `/code` or `/data` folders using the buttons at the top of the left-side **Files pane**.

Any plots, figures, and results data should be saved in the `/results` directory. At the end of each run, these files will appear in the right-side **Reproducibility pane**, where you can view and download them. When you publish a capsule, the most recent set of results will be preserved as part of the capsule.

## Environment and Dependencies

Click **Environment** on the left to find a computational environment to accommodate your software (languages, frameworks) or hardware (GPU) requirements. You can then further customize the environment by installing additional packages. The changes you make will be applied the next time your capsule runs. See Code Ocean's help articles on [the computational environment](https://help.codeocean.com/getting-started/the-computational-environment/configuring-your-computational-environment-an-overview) for more information.

## Environment Caching

The next time you run your capsule after making changes to any part of the environment, a custom environment will be built and cached for future runs.

When you publish a capsule, its computational environment will be preserved with it, thereby ensuring computational reproducibility.
